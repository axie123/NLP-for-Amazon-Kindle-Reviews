"This is a VERY tiny dictionary, which makes it very difficult to read. It also is geared toward British English, which further limits its usefulness for American readers. It is compact and plastic bound, which does make it a true &quot;pocket sized&quot; book, but if you are looking for readability and overall usefulness, I would look a bit further.",0
"Very soon into this work I began to feel a sense of amateurishness that I never felt with the Lions of Al Rassan or A Song For Arbonne.  The language was nowhere nearly as polished, the characters flatter, the plot more contrived and imitative.  So I looked at the copyrights.  Sure enough, this  was the first of Kay's published writings.  My, has he come a long way!!  I  didn't even finish the summer tree.  As soon as I found out it would be  just another of those &quot;Dark Lord&quot; books--where the good guys  battle a persona of ultimate evil--I just yawned and chucked it aside.  The  writing is really kind of corny sometimes, I didn't care much about any of  the characters--except perhaps Peter--and the idea is, well, how shall we  say, a tad old?  This book is basically a poorer rendition of LOTR mixed  with Narnia.  Kay matured magnificently in the books that came after,  peaking, I think, in The Lions of Al-Rassan.  Given the great stuff he's  written since the Fionavar Tapestry, I think we can forgive him his  youthful flailing.",0
"I'd never read any of Robin Hobb's books before, so I did not know what to expect. On the basis of this, I never plan to read any more. I hated this horrible book, and sold it off as soon as I could. I gave it two stars instead of one because Hobb does have some imagination and writing talent. But her book is full of stupid, unpleasant people doing stupid, unpleasant things to each other for stupid, unpleasant reasons. And as for the storyline involving Malta - Yuck! This girl is fourteen, and Hobb is female herself! Where the story can go from here I cannot tell and do not care. Avoid.",0
"If you have read some of Kay's later works--Tigana, the Last Light of the Sun--stop there!  You have seen what he has to offer.  Don't look here, back in 1984, when he wrote a book without really knowing what he wanted to say or how to say it.  Where do I begin?  OK, think of it this way: 5 Canadians in King Arthur's Court.  These grad students from Toronto are whisked away into a distant land, where they find themselves to be somehow 'chosen' to save the world.OK, OK, a bit cliche, but I can handle that as long as the plot is good, the characters worthwhile.  Well, they aren't.  They're not quite stock characters.  I wish they were, because then they would at least have the recognizability of the overly painted masked characters from a medieval morality play.  Instead, they're just basically anonymous.And then the magic starts.  Not the magic that great stories work on your brain, making you want to stay up all night just to get to the next chapter.  No, this is the magic of Fionavar.  Objects will just pop up out of nowhere and we're told that they have some great power.  OK, cool, I guess.  But could you at least tell me something why this thing got here?  Does it have a history?  A reason?  No.  And that's it.The plot stumbles along, seemingly skipping pages of very necessary explanation.  You can't tell if this is some sort of attempt at artistry and mystery, or if Mr. Kay just forgot about it.  It doesn't matter, though.  You're still forced to manually restart your suspension of disbelief and try to get back into the book, hoping that by page 321, it will have been worth it.  So you trudge along.And then a dark lord comes in with orcs to try and take over the world.And then a unicorn comes to save the day.  Wait a minute: Unicorns?  Yes.  Unicorns.  Really.  Well, one unicorn, actually, but it doesn't matter.  And it is written to be some sort of grand moment in the history of the world, and supposedly it is, but you don't really care, because this is a tiny, fake world about which we know nothing, and one which we haven't seen enough to care about at all!On the tinyness: don't let the map fool you.  This is not some grand work of imagination.  The entirety of Fionavar is about the size of Lithuania.  Not ancient pagan Lithuania; Modern, Russia-dominated, Cold-War shrunken Lithuania.  You can ride across this imaginary world in about 3 days--on horseback!  He says so himself.As it happens, most all of the important scenes of the book are just like the unicorn stunt.  Some ridiculous, probably avoidable dilemma is resolved by the sudden appearance of a predictable, cliche stroke of good luck.  Ugh.To his credit, Mr. Kay does have some skill at describing places and feelings.  It appears in his later works.  All in all, however, this is a frantic, sloppy thing.  Don't bother reading it, and do not DARE call it a ""classic.""",0
"I would have to say it is worth waiting until they drop the price to 8.99. Really, it is not a must read.",0
"It was a absolutely chore to dig through this book. I did not read it because it was enjoyable, only because I intend to read the next book and missing a hole can be difficult. I hope that Martin has not reached the hubris of Lucas where he begins taking a colossal dump on the good will he built up because no editor has enough stones to tell him that he needs to make some cuts.While I blame the last two book on the author - this is really a failure of the editor. An editor should be willing to tell even a strong author that cuts need to be made and areas tightened up. This is his Phantom Menace - pray there is no Attack of the Clones to follow.",0
I did not find this book as good as other readers. I would not have read it if it didn't get the great reviews.  T was disappointing.  The love story and some of the historic events of the circus were interesting.  found the descriptive animal abuse very upsetting.  I'm definitely not interested in seeing the movie.,0
"It's amazing how much was written without actually progressing anything to a satisfactory plot point.I'll admit that at first the series was intriguing and novel in approach, but it's now gone to a point of bloated ridiculous.  Too many characters, too much focus on things I couldn't give two sneezes about, all the while seeming to completely blitz over the characters (and plots) I liked accepting of course that the author didn't kill them first.In truth I've spent more time thinking about how I'd have liked the series to this point to be written than finding merit in how it was actually written and prayed for the first time in my known life that the Television adaptation of this now monstrosity severely edits it into something manageable and far more enjoyable for it.I honestly don't think I'll buy the next book, as much as on a point of principle for how annoyed I am with how this book was written.",0
I didn't realize this was the children's book in the Dr. Seuss series. I thought it was for adults. My mistake and I had to laugh at myself when I excitedly opened it up. I couldn't teach my dog any new tricks! :),0
"What bothers me about this book is the obvious editing flaws, like using the word widdle for little twice in 20 pages by two separate characters it has more impact if you choose it once for one character making fun of someones widdle toes or widdle fingers but not twice. I noticed it in the last book too with the word dun everything was described as dun, which is a color so it was their dun breeches or dun mules or dun this dun that, come on pick up a bloody thesaurus.  However I don't blame Martin who obvi has a lot of character development on his plate, I blame his editors. Unfortunately that is not my only problem...it seems like Martin could have really made an outstanding book here but chose a more circuitous route which made me feel disappointed.  I know he likes to slowly develop characters and one of the characters I hated in the previous books but started to really sympathize with was Reek/ Theron.  So kudos to him for that. However the dragons, how are a bunch of unruly monsters ever going to be able to stage a comeback for Dany in Westeros.  A little time spend in training them throughout this book would have given me some hope that they would be able to assist her in winning back Westeros sans Victarion. Or at least giving Dany the inkling that there was another Targaryen afoot would have been interesting.Also why do they always quote the ""Rains of Castemere"" did I miss some exciting ancient plot twist related to that song?  Help me out if you know the answer to that one.  But I digress, I got into these books after HBO and plowed through the first three which were absolutely amazing, these last two have been a how can I say it...a real bummer. The books are clogged with characters that in and of itself is sometimes hard to follow for me I wish there was a little more development of the lesser characters to make them more salient in my mind if you are going to bring them up every 200 or so pages make them stick please! So many coats of arms so many banners all of them confusing, I kept getting Roose and Ramsey confused.  And the people across the narrow sea were melting into one save a couple characters.  All in all I think I will like the next books if they flow as nicely as the first three, come on Martin you can do it!",0
"Right up front I certainly don't share Clancy's political leanings (slightly to the right of Rush Limbaugh). But that's not what occasions my rating (at least I hope not). I have thoroughly enjoyed every single Ryan book to this point, but in this novel Ryan ceases to be a mere mortal and takes on characteristics that remind me of a Christ figure who also happens to be a Republican. In the midst of Ryan's CONSTANT lament that he is ""not a politician"" we are treated to his/Clancy's views on VERY political issues from the top ten on the Clancy 'hit list' (lawyers, professional politicians, feminists, members of the press, gun control advocates, the Chinese, the Indians,) We are treated to Ryan's constant suffering via his soliquies on his his unworthiness. Sometimes Ryan's lines, ""take this cup from me"", ""I am not worthy"". ""why me, oh Lord"", sound like a new chapter from the New Testament. At one point Ryan bemoans the fate of 11 American passengers on an airline shot down by the Chinese; ""He was the president, he was supposed to PROTECT his people. He had failed them"". Finally (and way too late) his own press secretary tells him ""Jack, you're not God"". Of course, all the GOOD and TRUE people love Jack...real Americans (military, doctors, business men, and those who come to know him)...who recognize his integrity and his sincerity and his all around heroic character.When you can get away from Ryan's constant agony (he begins to remind me of Patricia Cornwall's tortured protagonist, Kay Scarpatta) the novel is very intertesting. As usual Clancy does his homework and emerges as very knowledgeable on so many subjects the mind boggles. And the other regulars are reassuringly normal (John Clark, Ding,Pat and Ed Foley). Lots of suspense, lots of good stuff. But I got so I wanted to skip over the testiment according to Jack Ryan to get to the real meat of the novel.",0
"I'm emotionally invested in the characters, but nothing seems to happen. When some plot lines starts to get interesting the book shifts to a new character. Disappointing, I hope they do a better job of the 4th season on HBO.",0
"I loved the first 3 books.  Literally could not put them down.  The 4th started getting way too detailed and draggin on.  No closure and GRRM keeps introducing even more characters and ""losing"" some.  This 5th book actually became boring and I lost interest.  The story line skips back in time and retelling story lines that have already been covered.  I'll probably read the next one, but if there isn't closure, that will be it for me.",0
"Warning, there are spoilers below.I really wanted to enjoy dance, bad. As upset as i was with the 5 year wait to get the second half of a mediocre book...i was really willing to give it a chance. I bought it the second it came out, brought my kindle with me everywhere so i could read it in my down time - paid close attention and picked up on little subtle things others might have missed - all this, and i was still disappointed.  (not in the Kindle tho, this thing is awesome, and no I'm not getting paid to say this.  It's perfect for someone who travels a lot for work).It really boils down to this - it doesn't feel like Martin enjoys writing about this world anymore. His behavior reinforces this feeling, too. It's like he's just bored of this world and has lost that energetic spark to create.Reading the first three books, it was like a man excited about the world he was building, excited about the stories, the characters, excited about what he was going to DO with them and he wanted to get there as smoothly and quickly as possible. Remember when Catelyn left for King's Landing in one chapter, and then arrived there next chapter? It's because the journey was unimportant - that stuff was filler - what happened to her IN King's Landing was important.Reading the last two, it was like he wasn't really sure what to do anymore, he couldn't figure out where he was going, he just had to fill up the pages with something, and he kept thinking back and forth on what to write. adding, deleting, adding, deleting - this is a worrisome sign when indecision, apathy, and indifference about a tale begin to rear their ugly head.It's this energetic drive when you have a story you want to tell.  But I didn't get that here from Martin, which is disappointing, because the man has genuine talent.  He just doesn't seem to be inspired enough to use it. I never got the impression of a clear vision. I didn't get a sense of his excitement for these characters. It shows up in a lot of ways - the tired cliches, the empty characterizations of the main viewpoints - it feels like Dance was a homework assignment to him, a very unwelcome homework assignment. ""This one was a three bitches and a bastard"", indeed it was, and that feeling comes across in his writing style.I really just feel he's bored and out of ideas. He's tired of Westeros, he isn't sure what to do anymore, and he's just stringing things along with random WTF moments thrown in to try and maintain our interest and fake excitement. It's similar to sudden loud sounds or 'GOTCHA' moments in bad scary movies; using cheap tricks to try and evoke a sense of fear when the plot itself can't.There are only a few moments where I get a sense of the old Martin. Reading Theon's chapters were interesting. Theon actually had an arc, an evolution, and you got the sense that George enjoyed telling this story. Too bad he had to ruin it with yet another cliffhanger ending. In fact, this was one of the few true cliffhangers in the book, in my opinion. The other 'cliffhangers' were never set up properly and are more like 'dangling threads' that came out of nowhere.We have Jon getting the Caesar treatment, Stannis marching on Winterfell, Theon and Jeyne escaping, Aegon landing in Westeros, the situation on the Wall, the Pink Letter... Too much buildup here with too little payoff!And then one of the big cliffhanger moments from the first book - Brienne - gets barely a mention in this! We are left to deduce what she most likely said and her agreement to lead Jaime to UnCat in return for her life - yet another plotline that goes nowhere. At the end of the book, effectively, nothing big or major has happened that we can see the result of. Dany is basically back where she started, realizing she should have gone to Westeros. The entire sideshow in Meereen has effectively accomplished nothing. A lot of interesting things happen to the characters that are ultimately irrelevant. The Others are still persona non grata, mentioned only in shadows. Dragons still haven't returned. Stannis hasn't really conquered anything meaningful. Tommen is still king. Dorne is still 'progressing'. The Ironborn are still the same. Not enough major action has happened.  I can accept one book of mostly filler, but two? A Dance with Dragons feels like it was written to meet a word count! What's next, he goes through and increases the font size on all the periods to add some more volume? He might as well, it'd be just as entertaining.The problem is, Martin could have easily given us at least one big climax in this book. You could have given us a Meereen showdown with results, you could have given us Jon's ""death"" and obvious rebirth as Azhor Az'hai or whatever, you could have given us the Others finally attacking in force, you could have given us Victarion or Tyrion meeting Dany, you could have given us the battle of Winterfell and the results - there are so many things he could have done that we don't get to see. He could have given us the first use of Dragons in war, and that would have fit right in the with the title. I don't mind cliffhangers, but really we should have gotten SOMETHING resolved in this book so it doesn't feel like a giant tease.The few redeeming moments for me - Selmy, Wyman's awesomeness (""So young"" said Wyman Manderly. ""Though mayhaps this was a blessing. Had he lived, he would have grown up to be a Frey.""), ""Would you like Freys with that"", Theon - simply don't add enough to justify book for me.If you enjoy reading detailed prose, and seeing a world being built by a very skilled author, you might enjoy this.  If you're a huge fan of everything remotely to do with the world Martin has skillfully created, then you will find a lot here to fill in the blanks.  Unfortunately, most of those blanks were blank for a reason - we just didn't care.  I still don't.If you're a fan of an engaging, interesting plot - the sort of plot that we saw in the first three books - I'd give it a pass.PS: Martin may denounce us here at Amazon as trolls and sockpuppets, but I think that makes a mockery of the good rating system that has made Amazon so useful for people like me in the past.  Mr. Martin, if you read this, please make note of the 'verified purchaser' next to this review.  I'm a real person, with a real opinion.",0
"I read this book on my kindle a week after watching the movie and I have to say I enjoyed the movie a lot more. They did a number of adaptations for the screenplay that made it work better. Like August was the owner in the movie, but in the book he wasn't but he was in charge of the animals and Uncle Al was the owner. At any rate, the movie was made for a PG-13 rating and though there were some mild situations and language, it was tolerable, vs. the book, where there was a lot of swearing and a few lewd descriptions that weren't necessary for the story in order for it to be a good one. If not for the cheesy sexual stuff and multiple F-bombs dropped, I would have enjoyed the book more. The story itself is quite good, but the delivery of it was lacking because of the language and overly-detailed sexual situations. So if I were to recommend one, I'd tell people to choose the movie over the book. It's less crude, and ultimately, a more satisfying experience. The story structure itself reminded me a lot of The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks.",0
"Don't bother to even read this book. Wait two more and u will still find everything in the same place. I must agree with the other reviews, I too am invested in the series but I have fallen ""out of love"" with this whole dragged out mess",0
"As a black woman, I too found this difficult to read.  On a practical level I felt that Ms. Gregory pushed too hard to make this story plausible.  I found no link for this romance, no real spark.  I found the 'love at first sight' a bit of rubbish for this day and time.  Mehuru seemed to good, a little too ""Kunta Kente-ish"".  And Frances was vapid and skittish, hardly the type of love match one is used to.  I loved all her other books, but I had to make myself finish this.",0
"This review is solely for the Kindle version of Executive Orders.This is one of my favorite Clancy novels.  I re-read it every few years.  I re-purchased it for the Kindle and must say that this is the most horrible conversion to Kindle I have seen to date.  It's like they just opened up the source file, did a SAVE-AS and picked Kindle format and went to market with it.  It is so full of typos and errors that it looks like it was OCRed.  I will be re-reading my hardback rather than the Kindle version.",0
"In light of almost unanimous praise for this book among other reviewers, I hate to be ""that guy.""  I'm taking a seminary course on Nouwen, so this was the first of five of his books that we were assigned.  And I really wanted to like it.  But I'm not sure that I've ever fallen asleep so frequently while reading a book as I did with this one.  I just didn't connect with it at all.His main thesis is that the Christian life consists of movement along three trajectories, from loneliness to solitude, from hostility to hospitality, and from illusion to prayer (connected to our relationships with ourselves, other people, and God, respectively).  My problem with the book is that my experience don't even remotely align with what Nouwen describes and seemingly assumes as normative.  Quite frankly, I have felt a lot of deficiency in my life, but I don't think that I have ever felt lonely (and I don't just think that's merely an indication of a lack of serious personal reflection and honest self-appraisal).  But without that shared experience, the first movement is meaningless to me.The second movement, from hostility to hospitality, was the one that resonated most with me, as I understand my natural inclination towards hostility (though more covert than overt) and see God's different intention for my interaction with others.  But the final movement was where he totally lost me.  The sort of spiritual reality that he describes as prayer is so far removed from my own experience and so unappealing to me that it didn't connect with me at all.It's worth noting that I found one particular point to be extremely powerful.  In the middle of Chapter 8, I love Nouwen's words about the need to learn from church history and from the saints throughout the ages.  ""The really great saints of history don't ask for imitation.  Their way was unique and cannot be repeated.  But they invite us into their lives and offer a hospitable space for our own search...""  This is great stuff.Yet, overall, I can say that reading this book was a strangely unnerving experience for me.  Having heard rave reviews about Nouwen and his work from seemingly countless people whom I respect, I want to love his books.  It's not that I found ""Reaching Out"" to be utterly disagreeable but rather, that it is just totally unintelligible to me.  I just don't know what he's talking about, from an experiential standpoint.  It's as if his experiences are completely foreign and his perspectives are totally unknown to me.  On one level, I'm disappointed in my inability to gain more from the book, and on another level, I'm wondering if I need to just acknowledge that Nouwen simply isn't a writer who connects with me, and that might not be a reflection on him or on me but simply an observation of reality.In light of the other positive reviews, I won't be so arrogant as to suggest that ""Reaching Out"" is somehow a lousy book.  I will instead suggest that it's not for everyone, and it certainly wasn't very helpful for me.",0
"Okay, so I'm not a Cussler fan and read the book on a dare.  This book is laughable.  The writing is inept, the plot facile.  The dialog is unintentionally hilarious.  It is a mystery to me why so many people read  Cussler.  Hey, I'm no literary snob, but even for escapist literature  Sahara is just dreadful.  After I read this book I was inspired to host a  &quot;Clive Cussler&quot; writing contest. Needless to say, the entrants  were better than the inspiration!",0
"Though I had enjoyed Clancy's previous techno-thrillers, this one was a  major disappointment.  By making Ryan president, he has painted himself  into a corner that only reliance on Ryan's flimsy alter-ego, John Clark (a  man who will soon be fighting evildoers from a walker if Clancy  acknowledges the passage of time) will allow him to escape from.  Otherwise, how plausible is it for the President of the United States to be  personally getting involved with gun battles with terrorists and drug  runners?  This may not have weakened the novel itself had it not been for  Clancy's interjection of his simplictic politics into his fictional world.  His attempt to define how the world should be run through his characters'  action sapped what remaining enjoyment this novel contained.  Traditional  Clancy fans would be best served by stoppping at ""Debt Of Honor""  to let their imaginations work from there rather than the ideological box  Clancy seems bent on constructing.",0
"This book is about people talking. And thinking. And making plans. Lots of plans. Plans made, plans abandoned, plans changed. But no plans acted upon, oh no. We wouldn't want that. That would kill the immersion. Immersion in cement, quickly hardening, thickening much as the plot has, never to move again.Immersion happens within a story, around events and characters and locations you care about. Immersion in minor details unrelated to the plot, in the histories of towns which you have never heard about and will never visit again - what good is that? If you were on a (paid) tour of historic landmarks in London and the guide began speaking of the history of New Zealand, because, you know, Australia was a colony of Britain and New Zealand is right next door, would you feel like you got your money's worth? Of course not.George bombards us with copious descriptions of food and ruins, serving no purpose beyond his transparent desire to showcase the detailed history of his world. Dragons came, things done got burned, now they're ruins. We got it the first ten times. We especially got it after Tyrion took a mind-numbingly boring carriage ride to nowhere. You know, the one where he woke up, ate several paragraphs of food, took - or witnessed - pisses, looked out the window and described a ruin, ate more paragraphs, then slept and repeated it. And repeated it again. And again. And again. And suddenly the chapter was over, and you were left wondering how any editor worthy of the title had left that in the book. If you were like me, you wondered that several times while reading this book.Dany, as a character, is unrecognizable. Gone is the fierce Dany of old, replaced by a painfully clueless teen girl with a mindless crush. A girl who worries more about what she's wearing and who is staring at her than any events occurring around her. Twilight's Bella would look down on ADWD's Dany.""Are they looking at my breast? They should totally be looking at my breast. I want them to look at my breast. Ooh, a penis. I'm turned on. Can they see that I'm turned on? They should totally see that I'm turned on."" SHUT. UP.  I half expected Dany to whip out her phone and text,""like omg, dis guy iz SOOO totes hawt! LoL >;P*~*~*DrAgOnQuEeN Dany*~*~* ""This book could have had interesting moments, but they were all killed with chapter after chapter after chapter of setup and minor plot details hashed out in painful detail. So when the big reveals finally come, they're things you knew about hundreds of pages ago, making you wonder why the revelation was left hanging at the end of a chapter, as if it were a big deal. Showing the same revelation from multiple points of view isn't interesting, it's unnecessary. Show it from the point of view which would have the most impact and at the time when it would be most startling, then get on with the freaking story.Not even the cliffhangers are really even all that interesting, because they're just more setup. More setup instead of something actually happening.If AGOT had gone at this pace, the book would have ended with Ned and Robert arriving back at King's Landing after having described every meal and farmhouse to be eaten or seen, respectively, along the Kingsroad, and with readers left wondering why it was called ""A Game of Thrones"" and not ""A Ride in Carriages."" Just as readers of this book will be left wondering why it's called ""A Dance with Dragons."" Because fewer dragons make an appearance than do turtles. You can call it ""A Swim with Turtles,"" if you'd like. It's a far more apt description of the book and its pacing.These last two books should simply never have been written. There is not enough story here for one book, let alone two or three. And I don't understand George's sudden distaste for flashbacks. Some of the signature events of the series have been told entirely through flashbacks, stories, recollections, and so on.Robert and Ned's uprising. The Starks being murdered by the mad king. Jaime's murder of Aerys, and Ned finding him seated on the Iron Throne. The murder of Elia and her children. Lyanna and Rhaegar, from the tourney to the Tower of Joy, with mysteries as diverse as frog men and blue flowers. Tyrion's wedding. Heck, even recent events like Rob's victory in the west and his marriage. All major events do not require books/chapters devoted to them.Considering that those events were told so well through flashbacks, does anyone besides George honestly believe that the carriage rides and all-around NOTHING that has happened in AFFC and ADWD were so much story that they had to have entire books devoted to them? Honestly?After AFFC and the long wait, I promised that I would only borrow ADWD, not buy it. I made good on that promise, as the lack of ""Amazon Verified Purchase"" on this review will attest. With George utterly unrepentant in regards to the pacing, style, and long waits for these past two books, I am now promising the same for Winds of Winter. And I'm not alone.This series may still be redeemable, but I doubt that I will ever find it in my heart to forgive GRRM for making me DREAD Dany and Tyrion chapters. Dread, it rhymes with bread, served with bacon grease and garlic and... oops, I've found myself randomly writing about food every few paragraphs since finishing this book. I've also taken to letting food dribble down my chin, since ADWD showed me that it is impossible for grown men or women to eat without slobbering all over themselves. It is known.",0
"I've decided I just can't finish this book. The main character is a 23-year old male, but c'mon - I just don't appreciate some of the details the author is having him describe and they are totally unnecessary to the story. I've read almost nine chapters and decided I don't need any more images like the explicit strip scene, the details of a graphic ""8-pager"", and I certainly didn't need the picture of what the dwarf is doing alone on his cot while looking at the graphic magazine. It's a big disappointment because the story is actually interesting and I want to find out what happens but not badly enough to wade through the sludge. I don't think I've been this disappointed in a story since the ending of Angela's Ashes.",0
"I hunkered down and read Dance with Dragons having read the previous four in the series.  Ended up skimming the whole thing and even that was a waste of my time.  All the really good characters are left unresolved for the most part.  Dumbest thing ever.  Really, really, really frustrating and disappointing. I can't recall being so completely disgusted with a book and an author.",0
I realize that these books are supposed to be about the &#34;land&#34; versus individual characters. But come on. Stop killing people for the sake of killing people. If I hadn't committed so much time the books already then I wouldn't bother with the next one.Shock value for shock value is really absurd.Plus have a little more closure in between books.,0
"Not even close.  I bought the series based on the Nebula and Hugo Awards.  What a HUGE mistake....and I will never trust those particular award juries again.  This guy does not have much to say, but says it repeatedly, exhaustively, and ad nauseum.  The characters are exclusively two dimensional, all lacking passion and driven by inexplicable logic to actions that make little sense.  The extensive descriptive narrative is mind numbing and filled with geological jargon.  You spend most of the book wading through this blah blah blah, and when something finally does happen, it is disappointinly anti-climactic.  I will never buy another piece of literature by this author.",0
"I thought this book was poorly developed and depressing. Really, can anybody come up with a book that doesn't involve infidelity? This guy threw away his whole life and what was the point of this book? I thought it stunk. I can't even believe I read this tripe. stay away from this author...",0
"I finally got through the last book. I've been reading a couple chapters before sleep every night. They've been like mini character portraits. Enjoyable, but most don't seem to have anything do with the other chapters. I feel a little empty, despite the one thousand pages. I've been left hanging--far too many loose ends, and no real climactic finish.There are already some great two-star reviews here that capture how I feel about this book (and the fourth one.) Disappointed, mostly. I began to notice a lot of repetitive prose (""must needs,"" ""nipples on a breastplate,"" etc.) and that's a sign to me that the actual story wasn't really holding my interest.Why doesn't George outline his stories better? He could have ended both Feast for Crows and this book on climactic scenes if he had. And trimmed out the bloat. He badly needs an editor.",0
"Buy nearly any of the other Christie audiobooks created within the past few years rather than spend your money on this one.It's not nice to be harsh, but I nearly couldn't finish listening to this set, because so few of the stories were compelling enough to even take my mind off the traffic during my commute. Although I like nearly all of Christie's novels, this collection of short stories seems to indicate that Christie really didn't understand short story-writing, or was churning out stories without much heart for it or perhaps much good editing-- at least at the time.At the end of each story, I sat there feeling cheated--as if the ending had been rushed to fit into a set number of pages. It's more like reading one of those 2-Minute Mysteries than the bit of nice, warm, chewy Agatha Christie brownie of a mystery I was hoping for.Christie normally excells at creating delightful (either good or bad) characters, whose quirks and social interactions we anticipate and enjoy. Her normally keen sense of social wit is rather lackluster here. These short stories suffer greatly from her inability or lack of time to develop the characters and the social setting within so few pages.Also, there probably is a following for this character, but I find Harley Quinn stories simply silly, and will never read them again. In a short story format there is simply no scope for a novelist, who isn't trained to have the discipline, to get us to suspend disbelief at the ooh-aah supernatural Mr. Quinn. I enjoy a good fantasy or what have you, but these stories simply fail to build into anything and seem terribly impressed with themselves.If you'd like to explore Christie's little known ""non-star"" characters to try something of hers you haven't read, I enjoyed Ordeal by Innocence and Elephants Can Remember (which features ""Ms. Oliver"", who represents Christie herself).",0
"I decided to finally read this book after hearing all the ""hoop-la"" about the movie.  And, it was exactly what I assumed it was after reading several non-Amazon reviews.This book is interesting for this time period because of its subject matter,a love story set in a circus in 1930's USA. This subject is unusual for this time because circuses are rarely written about anymore.  I enjoyed the author's inclusion of some research she'd done on the history of circuses.  However, I didn't feel that any of the characters was developed enough to catch and hold the reader's interest such as is found in the ""I couldn't put it down"" genre of books.  Also, I felt that the story being told by a 93 yr. old man, in the first person, was distracting in its flipping back and forth in two time periods.  I couldn't understand what the need was for the old man in the story unless it was for the bitter-sweet, totally unrealistic end.This book should be advertised by Amazon as a book for young adults.  It just does not have the depth and dedication to story as those of more experienced, and more interesting, writers.",0
Stop bothering me with asking for reviews before being able to read another. Good way to turn people off from reading more,0
"ADWD ""Awards"":Most engaging chapters: TyrionMost events: JonMost satisfying story arc: Theon and Asha GreyjoyMost progression: BranMost confused, convoluted, complex: Dany / Quentyn / Selmy / Tyrion / VictarionMost boring: Dany and TyrionPointless: The Watcher & MelisandreUnsatisfying: Everything except the Greyjoys[....].Reason for my awards / review?  'Cause I'm opposite of impressed w/ ADWD. I was anticipating ASOS-material from the positive early reviews, but besides a couple of Tyrion chapters, I found this book yet another metaphorical chapter to a genre chock-full of bloated epic fantasy storytelling. I was expecting ASOS events, yet I was sadly disappointed by AFFC meanderings. Since this book parallels AFFC in many respects, I suppose it only fitting that the book suffers from similar failures in progress, resolution and satisfaction. I would like to put my official stamp of disapproval on this series which has deteriorated drastically from a stellar third book, A STORM OF SWORDS. In A STORM OF SWORDS, one shocking event after another seemed to move the book at a torrid pace. In A FEAST FOR CROWS and A DANCE WITH DRAGONS, I was hard pressed to find events, much less any movement to the novel. In spite of it all, this book fares better than A FEAST FOR CROWS... a lot better. Sadly, that's not saying much.Unlike its predecessors, even if we were to take AFFC and ADWD together, there exists so few resolutions to any existing plots that the two latest novels cannot possibly stand on their own. Unlike its predecessors, AFFC and ADWD feel like bridge novels; nothing is resolved in a satisfying manner and more questions and plot tangents arise instead. Unlike his first three novels, none of the story arcs in AFFC and ADWD (with the possible exception of the Greyjoy story arc) contained endings unto themselves and yet left the reader wanting more.1. A GAME OF THRONES AGOT (4 / 5)2. A CLASH OF KINGS ACOK (3 1/2 / 5)3. A STORM OF SWORDS ASOS (5 / 5)4. [...] AFFC (1 / 5)5. [...]A DANCE WITH DRAGONS[/url] ADWD (2 / 5)",0
"I don't know why I persisted through these 5 books.  Words, words and more words.  Martin evidently doesn't know how to write a tale that has a beginning, a middle and an end.  He jumps from one thread to another without ever wrapping up anything.  Bah!",0
"It saddens me to say this, but GRRM has fallen from the throne of the best writer. Where the first three books were pieces of art, A Dance with Dragons, just like its predecessor, represents a continued downward spiral of a once great series. I absolutely cannot understand how an author with consistent good writing, in first three books, can mess up so badly. Suffice it say, I found myself skipping through the book. The book was too long and accomplished too little. The POV characters seem to be frozen in time while we are reading about other POV characters. It is safe to say that GRRM has hit a writer's block because only that can explain this disaster of a book. I say disaster because I had high expectations from GRRM, honestly speaking, this was an average fantasy book but it doesn't deserve to be in the same series as a Game of thrones, Feast for Crows and Storm of Swords. All I have left to say is that its high time to let this dying horse to be put out of its misery.",0
"The book is okay so far, but I'm very distracted by the horrible Kindle formatting.  I've never had a problem with a Kindle book before, but this one is full of gaps and spacing problems. Dialogue is separated by abnormally huge gaps, but author-intended spaces intended to denote a pause are the same gaps as the extraneous ones; in other words, the intentional spaces are lost in the shuffle.  This makes the book very hard to read and follow, since I'm never sure if it's a ""Kindle"" gap or an ""author"" gap.  This was very poorly digitized.  It almost makes the book unreadable because it is such a distraction.",0
"I really enjoyed 'The Other Boleyn Sister' and was anxious to read more from the author. This book was a waste of time! I was more than half-way through the book when I realized I didn't care what happened to any of the characters and that most of the book wasn't even logical. For instance, the lead slave seemed to learn to speak English AND write in two chapters, the love affair between the lead slave and Frances was not even a little bit believable, not to mention the 'secret'pregnancy. I can't believe this is the same author. I will try to read other books from Ms. Gregory, but I would not recommend this one to anyone.",0
"Even though I'm pretty sure this is meant to be ironic, I hated it.  I hated the main character, the plot, the other characters, and the person who recommended it (a little bit).  This is one of the few books I quit reading before the end.  I removed it from my Kindle.",0
"Many many reviews have been posted, and I will attempt not to repeat what has been said already.I cannot comprehend the positive reviews of this trash.  I am a lover of quality historical novels - Sharon Kay Penman and Jean Plaidy are mentioned by other reviewers ... Phillippa Gregory is in no way comparable.  The Other Boleyn Girl is historical only in that it purports to take place a long time ago.Mary Boleyn is potrayed as THIRTEEN years old when she is engaging in witty repartee with king far too old and worldly to be legitimately interested in what she had to say.  Indeed, in our world, Henry would have landed on a Nightline special.  Well, we know what HE was interested in, but why would we, the reading public, want to read a novel romanticizing behavior which we claim to believe is criminal?And for some readon Gregory has chosen to distort history and represent Mary Boleyn as even younger than she probably was, and far more innocent.  If we wonder why teenagers go on-line to flirt with and meet unknown older men, we need only look at is considered entertaining in a novel.The character of Anne is no more credible ... the author wold have us believe that powerful families intent on pimping a child to the king would listen to a 15-16 year old girls's advice on how to accomplish its plan.Overall, the characters are more Sex and the City (I can see Samantha as Anne)than history.  I read this nonsense for far longer than I should have, waiting for improvement.  Then I gave up. Now I am stuck with this book as well as the sequel (which I have no intention of reading).  Both are destined for Half Price Books.",0
"This is the type of novel I expect to be on the bestseller list and is why I typically overlook popular novels, sometimes to my own detriment. An elderly man, now in a nursing home, looks back on his time spent as a veterinarian in a circus. It's a story that could have been capable of more, but the plot seemed fairly predictable and the characters not that believable or rounded. It wasn't bad, mind you, I guess you could say this elephant was just too watered down.",0
"I've read other books by Phillipa Gregory and like them, but I was very disappointed in this one.  I love British history but this one contained too much focus on the sexual explorations of the main characters.  Okay, I know Mary Boleyn had affairs, but I honestly don't need to read about how the king excites her nor about she and William sneak off every chance they can to have sex all night long.  I don't need to hear descriptions of sexual intimacy that includes everything but ""doing the deed.""",0
"The master story-teller has slipped a cog in this disagreable book about disagreable people.This is the back-story of John ""Clark,""  general doer of necessary but unpleasant acts in Jack Ryan's sphere.Clancy's habit of starting paragraphs without immediately naming the character is even more confusing, in that he uses flash-backs tucked into the then present time, without clueing us in.He goes in great detail into disgusting things done to a couple of lost souls, several times.And as usual, uses names the same as other people's, with a Ryan who is not Jack and not even a relative.  (Let's recommend one of the books of given names written for prospective parents who lack inspiration.)(I will admit that two-thirds of the way through I skipped to the last chapters to get the conclusion without having to wade through any more of all of the above -- and I'm a compulsive reader.)It does at least introduce Admiral Greer, a help to those of us wanting our imaginary world organized.I'm hoping the next is cohesive and not unnpleasant.",0
"I don't know how I feel about this one. I enjoyed reading it in the same way I might enjoy watching whatever made-for-tv movie might be playing on USA on a random weeknight. My main complaint about the book was its totally bad way of giving information by way of really bad exposition. Most authors seem to be able to reveal things in a clever way that comes naturally in the story.Often it is the equivelant of writing a character who comes out and says  ""It's good to have you home; I see that you have sucessfully driven to work and accomplished your tasks there. By the bag in your hand I can tell that you have gone to the store and purchased the bananas, tomatoes, and pie crusts that we needed.""",0
"Loved the first 3 books, but NOTHING is happening in this series.  The last few books have been nothing but characters sailing or riding from one location to another.  That's it.  Not a single thing was resolved in this massive book.  Just a total story failure on every level.  Sucks.",0
The first chapter of A Game of Thrones involved The Other's attacking and killing a group of men from the Night's Watch. After reading that introductory chapter is there anyone who would have wagered that five books later The Others would have barely appeared again and done very little when they did?This is an example of the issues with Martin's story over the last two books. New stories are being added to the narrative and the story from the first few books is is moving at a glacial pace. A story that started with 7 or 8 main characters has expanded to over 25 and the series is suffering as a result.There are long stretches in this book where nothing happens. It's  adreadfully slow read and does not match the excitement and thrills of the first three books in the series.,0
"The author (GRRM) owes his fans an apology for releasing this terrible book. The most popular reviews pretty much cover it. 1000 pages of poorly written squat.I could have lived with the lack of plot progression, but I didn't even enjoy the pages as I turned them. It was a painful marathon that ended by simply running out of pages.GRRM's quality of writing is clearly not present. As others remarked, it's like the trainwreck of Jordan all over again. Lines repeated over and over until you want to scream. Having to chew through endless pages of describing foolish things like food. Way too many plot threads and nothing happening during any of them. Rich characters suddenly becoming two-dimensional to the point of being corny (e.g. ""Gee whiz I'm just a knight... I can only fight... gee golly I sure could never be deceptive. Shucks."") I actually grew to hate reading certain characters' chapters.I waited eagerly on this book for years as many of you have. This one was so bad, that I no longer eagerly await the next book and deem the series to likely end poorly.To go from such greatness to this drivel is... a disappointment. If I ever buy another GRRM book it will be used to ensure the author makes no money off it. He will have to redeem himself before seeing another penny of mine.I would mail my copy of this turd back to him if I knew his address, so that it would not waste space in my trashbin.",0
"I was not impressed with this book.Very little technical data, no data on many of the excellent images in the book.The writing was flowery and arty rather than concise with information to convey.If your looking for a book to teach you something, I would not recommend this book.John Shaw's Nature Photography book is, however, outstanding.",0
"I expected to enjoy this book, since I love military and suspense novels. However, I soon realized that this book wasn't what I thought it was. The dialogue is truly awful, unless you enjoy comic book tough guy language. The heroes use flippant humor when they are in grave danger, not just once or twice, but continuously. I almost stopped reading, it was so annoying. And a Brit writing American slang dialogue for one of the characters is almost as bad as an American writing British dialogue. It just doesn't sound quite right.The plot, although certainly creative, just wasn't believable. Maybe this type of novel isn't meant to be believable, but it sure is something I like to see. And there weren't just one or two instances of these improbable plot elements. They just kept coming and coming. For example: an escape from their German captors based on a brilliant improvisation. In another instance, an impersonation of a double agent based on unbelievable luck, gullibility of the SS (not generally known for this) and a few convenient added elements that seemed just too good to be true.Now I should say that this type of book might appeal to a teenage boy. I think I would have enjoyed it at that age. But as an adult, I would look for better writing and a more realistic plot. If you are looking for something in the way of a 20th century military novel, I would recommend the following authors: Jack Higgins, James Webb, Tom Clancy, Patrick Robinson, Herman Wouk, James Jones, Larry Bond, Dale Brown, and Anton Myrer. _The Eagle has Landed_, _The Caine Mutiny_ and _The Hunt for Red October_ are among the best of these novels that I have read. Jack Higgin's books are probably most similar to MacLean's, with exciting plots and heroic characters, but with more realism and better dialogue.",0

"The audio cassette of &quot;Sahara&quot; was so bad, in my opinion, that it does not deserve a review from someone of my caliber.My wife and I put it in the car when we went on an overnighter to get away from the kids a week or so ago.  We listened to it for about 20 minutes into the drive and then shut it off, it was so lame.I finished it a while later on my commute to and from work.  After having finished it, all I can say is that I am glad I do not have to listen to Tom Wompat try and sound like the sexy Eva Rojas anymore, it was almost nauseating.This is my second Clive Cussler book in the last month and I have to say he is not as good as I remember him.  I remember really liking &quot;Treasure&quot; quite a few years ago when I was still a kid.I have now listened to &quot;Sahara&quot; and have read &quot;Shock Wave&quot; in the last month and both have been so unbelievable that they were actually funny at times.",0
"This book (and the last) were a drag. This author needs some serious editing! Seems like he is getting lost in the descriptive part of the narrative and the thrust and direction are too diluted by far. Also, we are running out of original protagonists, and I find myself becoming detached from the characters. There are only two I care about any more, and it is getting hard to wade through pages and pages of descriptive nothingness to keep up with them. Not sure I will continue with the series. I feel kind of abused!",0
No need for the 12 paragraph reviews I've been reading.  The review is simple: After the third book this guy just ran out of gas but was making so much dough he kept going. Sort of. But not very well.,0
"Honestly, I couldn't believe that the book was over. I got it on Kindle, so I wasn't really aware of how far along in the book I was. I happened to glance down at the percentage line at the bottom, and I was 94% of the way through the book! I was shocked. I heard the book was over 1,000 pages, so how had I got through it so quickly? And how was the book ending when nothing actually happened?? Then it dawned on me-- all those pages that I had clicked my way through, because nothing was happening (or because Martin was going into painstaking detail describing someone being burned, raped, or mutilated). I had unwittingly skipped my way through the book.I was crushed. I had been looking forward to curling up with my favorite character: Daenerys and her dragons (as the title led me to believe), hopefully heading to Westoros to give the evil Cersei her due. (though Jaime I had started to grow fond of after that last book) But the dragons are chained up (except for an exciting scene in the fighting pits), and Daenerys has lost the fire she had when she double-crossed the slavers and burned them all in book three.Tyrion, my second favorite character (at least since Martin killed off/exiled/changed all the Starks), doesn't do a darn thing the whole book.Jon Snow proves himself totally unfit to command the Wall, and gets killed for it. But what else is he supposed to do when apparently there isn't a decent man of the Nights Watch left anyway??There are a whole bunch of new perspectives that I didn't care at all about. The problem with killing off all your main characters is that your readers are no longer emotionally involved in the story. So we (readers) don't feel bad about leaving all these newcomers to whatever fate Martin may have in store for them.I never thought I would say this about a thousand page book, but it ended too fast. It could have ended even sooner, but I kept expecting something to happen, so I kept reading. A good editor would have cut this down to 200 pages, tops. Frankly, I could have done without the whole book, except the scene where Daenerys first rides the dragon.",0
"This is the same review I posted for Green Mars. Also applies to Blue Mars. I'd give it 0 stars if I could.I love epics, so I plodded through this trilogy, hoping it would get better, but it never did. I could sense that Robinson was extremely proud of the detailed world he created, but the story is horrible. The story unfolds glacially, with no sense of movement. Just when you think you might be getting attached to a character, he/she dies. Interesting story lines get dropped. There are long, long stretches where Robinson just describes everyday life, in excruciating, boring detail. There is no excitement or suspense, no character that grabs you. It's like some dull person's real life, full of routine, disappointment, and boredom. Robinson's typical character has a dream, begins to pursue it, getting you inspired, then gets killed or just gives up and joins the cause he was fighting.This was the worst science fiction I have ever read. I can't believe I read all three books.",0
"I'm not sure what happened here. I can only guess that Martin has lost interest in this, and is dragging himself through the pages on the whipping insistence of his editor.There are flashes of what I enjoyed in the first three books, but those flashes are quickly snuffed by pages and pages of monotonous slush. Not even Tyrion can save this one.I've learned a lesson here. If you start a series, tell your story, and finish it promptly. Don't do... this.King did the same thing with The Dark Towers series. Fool me once...",0
"If you thought GRRM would redeem himself for the  A Feast for Crows snooze-fest, well, you were wrong. Rather than bringing the old GRRM to the game, he continued his decline in A Dance with Dragons.Taking the characters that were not in AFfC and a few new ones, he puts them to the same wandering that bored you before. Please feel free to:a.) not buy this book because it contributes almost nothing to the plot, orb.) feel cheated by another GRRM rip-off.If you are addicted to uncomfortable sex scenes, diarrhea and/or menus . . . well, you won't be too disappointed.",0
"Wayyyy too much technical detail, cardboard-ish characters and no obvious plot. I get that this is part 1 of a trilogy - all the mo0re reason that it should get you hooked. Nope.

She went from one of my favorite characters to oh crap not another Daenarys chapter. So yeah all in all we were ripped. He absolutely knows what he is doing. I love how he put off the release until the HBO show finished with a few weeks inbetween for people to read books 1-4 and be ready to buy book 5. If you think that was coincidental you are an idiot. No way it took him 6 years to write this book. No way it took him 3 years to ""unravel the knot"". Last book I buy written by GRRM. I will wait for the series to be completed and buy them from a used bookstore. I will not contribute another penny to GRRMs greed.",0
"I tried to like this edition of the story but unfortunately there were few chapters that captured my imagination. Wordy, descriptive, little action. I know it's mid story but I have no interest in all the courses of a meal. On top of that I think GRRM has pretty much knocked off the most interesting people and fails to create new ones who capture you.",0
"Tom Clancy is a great author, I will not take that away from the man.  From his first story to his masterpiece Without Remorse, he is without a doubt a phenomenal entertainer.  His current novels stemming from Debt of Honor, yet exclusively within this tale, his viewpoints are too prevalent within the tale to truly appreciate.  This would not be so bad, except for his characters internal soliloquy which are completely out of touch with cultural personalities (ie: when the Saudi prince ""wishes"" his country were more like America... not so much).  If he were to stay away from detailing his perifial characters whimsical thoughts, the novels would be shorter and that much better.  I feel he is trying to put too much of his perfect world into the books which ultimately take away from the great entertainment he provides.",0
"I was so looking forward to this novel - a somewhat trashy page-turner with an interesting historical backdrop. Well, it wasn't a page-turner, and the historical backdrop was so far from believable that I had no interest. It was trashy and truly juvenile. Frankly, I'm shocked that so many people have rated this novel highly. If you want a fun, trashy, historical page-turner, try Anne Rice's ""Cry To Heaven."" That was a guilty pleasure which I loved. ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" falls miles short.",0
"I don't know what I find more incredible:That a man who claims to be a writer wrote this book,a publisher actually published it,readers actually paid for it.I have never seen more childish, adolescent prose in book published by a major publisher. It was so bad, I put it down around page 180, only kept going that long because I kept thinking ""There has to be something to this if this guy's so popular"".Some people who liked the books even though the writing is bad say the action sequences and descriptions of foreign countries make up for it. I disagree. The action was not believable and the descriptions are shallower than seeing a country from  group tour bus window.",0
"This book contains a Monty Python and the Holy Grail reference on page 325 of the hardcover. That's about all you need to know about the ""quality"" of this entry into the series.If you want just a bit more, know that an entire plotline contained in the book (4 chapters or so) could have been excised and reinserted at the end in a couple of paragraphs.Marginally better than AFFC, but only because there's no Samwell Tarly. As hard as the characters try to get stuff accomplished, nothing really happens.",0
"Such promise in A Game of Thrones.  So much anticipation in A Clash of Kings.  The warning signals came for me in A Storm of Swords: the ratio of story versus ""rich fabric"" was reversed; and it was perpetuated in A Feast of Crows.  I was prepared to abandon the series right then, but didn't Martin promise to make it right in A Dance With Dragons?  Instead, Martin wrote as if he had no idea where his runaway project was going. Oh, and the HBO screenplay is still worse.",0
"This was a Book Club selection last year and our group of seven were looking forward to enjoying a recent best-seller. None of us liked it. I thought the story about circus life was interesting but I did not like any of the characters and although I tried, could not find a redeeming quality in any of them. I also did not care much for the writing style. Had it not been for Book Club, I would have quit a quarter of the way.",0
"Like many other reviewers, I think this could have been an excellent novel, if only the editor had done a better job.  Excess verbiage needs trimming, and gaps need filling.  As it stands, the book gets bogged down too much and too often.Entire parts could be distilled down to a chapter.  ""Homesick"", in particular, reads like the author forgot he was writing a novel, and was just delivering his pet theories on psychology.  ""Falling Into History"" consists largely of a planet-wide tour by John Boone, most of which seems to serve no other purpose than to illustrate that Mars is a planet, and planets are big.  Yah, I knew that.  ""Guns Under The Table"" could have been a lot shorter, given that it ends up being that none of the details had any bearing on the plot, the story, or the history.Descriptions of the magnificent desolation of the martian surface were really moving at the beginning.  Unfortunately, the author apparently thinks the reader has a short attention span, for he can't go two pages without reiterating this, at times word for word.  It gets to the point where one can recognize these from their lead-in and know to skip a paragraph.  Or three.I found many of the characters shallow and one-dimensional, ""caricatures, not people"", as another reviewer put it.  This was disappointing, as a few seemed to have some depth.  Boone charisma's really came through (once the author finished shipping him all over the planet for no real purpose).  I could really sympathize with Nadia at times (when the author wasn't hammering us with her tendency to engineer everything).  But too many of could be summed in a few words and then omitted from the prose.  ""I don't care what happens to these people.""Another irritation is that after slogging through all 572 pages, the ""end"" is very unfulfilling.  In truth, the book doesn't end -- it just stops.  I realize that ""real life"" often lacks neat endings, but this is fiction, and even history books manage to draw lines between events.All in all, if I knew it was going to be like this, I wouldn't have bothered.",0
"Alex Cross is an articulate, educated black man who is a homicide detective Washington D.C. police department. He just needs to be in a better novel.In this debut novel that features said character, Cross is put on a case to find two, white, wealthy kids abducted from a private school. This bothers him somewhat as he was on a case where two black children are missing, and yet no law officials seem interested.The villain of the piece is Gary Soneji, who masqueraded as an instructor of the private school; he is your typical psycho who is also brilliant and wants to be remembered throughout history. (These types of villains showed up a lot in the films of the 1990s).Cross meets a beautiful, blonde, white FBI agent named Jezzie whom he has a relationship with, and gets serious with...only that he finds out that she (in a confusing plot turn) had something to do with the two abducted white children. She was only faking a relationship with Cross to get police information from him; Jezzie and two other officers (also in a confusing plot turn) somehow took charge of the abducting operation of the private school children.Cross, in an unrealistic manner, catches Jezzie by going back to an island they traveled to early in the novel, having people placed strategically in places as if he had clairvoyance that Jezzie would 1. Come back with him to the island. 2. They would travel the exact way where his people would be waiting. 3. Jezzie would say exactly what he needed to know in order to have evidence to arrest her, and her cohorts.Interestingly, Jezzie is the one who is given the death penalty, and Soneji is not....(only hinting from his cell that he will be back). Moreover, it is said that Soneji had something to do with the missing black kids as well!Now, as aforementioned, I am familiar with the film adaptation of this novel; and, that wasn't an improvement. It was actually worse. Both the film and the novel it was based on is confusing, convoluted, and generic or cliched...not too mention unrealistic with how certain things automatically fall into place, or how the main character has - as aforementioned - plot clairvoyance.I do plan on reading the next entry, `Kiss the Girls,' and I hope there is an improvement.",0
"This entire trilogy suffers from the same issue. The subject of terraforming Mars and the political issues surrounding that effort is interesting; the characters, however, are uninteresting and often unlikeable. It feels like they are just vehicles for the scientific and political commentary, but as compelling as that commentary might be, it's hard to read because I simply don't care about the characters delivering it.",0
"Let me say first off that I hated this book. I haven't read a book in a very long time that annoyed me as much as this did.The main problem was its protagonist, the titular hero, the ""Mr. American"". In the description given of the story, he is drawn as some kind of Gary Cooper strong, silent type who is calm and measured on the surface, but deadly when riled. In the early parts of the book, I kept seeing Gary Cooper, and seeing the story itself as some kind of early 30s movie.But as the story evolves, the guy turns out to be a colossal wimp, torn hither-and-yon by every one of the ""sophisticated"" ""jaded"" and ""cynical"" old world characters he confronts. He is beaten at every game, robbed and led around by the nose by his beautiful but contemptible and worthless wife, who has married him just for his money. Worse, he is indecisive, and even when his life is put in peril in a confrontation with an old enemy, he relies on his British valet to get him out of it. At the end of the story--and this may give something away--when he has finally made a strong decision to leave his miserable marriage, at the last minute he gives in and crawls back to the worthless harridan he has been thoroughly abused and cheated by. Hardly the stuff of heroism and silent strength.Worse, this book came across to me, as an American, as an example of the most obnoxious type of British self-satisfaction, self-congratulation and indulgent condescension. The device of setting a foreigner down in your country and, seeing through his eyes the perfection and wonders of the country, is difficult to stomach. One example: our protagonist is from the American West, the two-fisted, two-gunned he-man I described above. He is constantly reassured, and constantly thinks to himself, about the efficiency and genius of the British police system, where no man can commit a crime and escape, where one cannot indulge in the Western type of slaughter and get away with it. When he himself, in self-defense, commits murder, he deigns it better to conceal the action rather than face the police with the truth, so deep is his fear of the coppers. Again, not the hard man of decision we were promised. Yet our author seems to forget that just a few years before this story is supposed to take place, in Britain, the most famous of uncaught criminals was openly and brazenly committing foul and very gaudy and public murder in the streets of the empire's capital city and mocking those same brilliant, efficient police for their inability to catch him!The plot ends up being a rehash of a story stereotype that was already old when this story was supposed to be taking place: that of the gosh-golly nave American amongst the sharps and wolves of degenerate Europe. This type of story has merit and possibilities even today, if its done as humor and satire, but not in an adventure tale where the hero should, at least at some time, stand up strongly, rather than be a complete puss from beginning to end. In a lot of ways, this came across to me as a Jeeves & Wooster story, but without the laughs and cleverness and sly social commentary that give this type of story some merit.I give it two stars instead of one for the following reasons: First, it is very well written. The author is an excellent and smooth writer. Unfortunately, in this novel at least, the story isn't worth the talent and, I think, it's a misfire. I'll have to try out a couple of his other books before I make any judgement on his place in fiction. They are probably better and maybe he was on unfamiliar ground here.Second, his history is excellent. Some times--a lot of times--you get a better idea of history by reading fiction than you do by reading straight history. He seems to have all his facts right here, he drops in a lot of telling details of the times, the social movements, the drift of Britain and Europe towards war and the ultimate destruction of the society portrayed here. This is what kept me reading when I wanted to abandon the book and is its strongest suit. When the novel started going back to the ""story"" and characters is when it lost me, but I persevered doggedly to its confusing and highly unsatisfying conclusion.So would I recommend it? Yes, to British readers of a Kiplingesque, jingo mindset, if they want to relive days of glory long gone by. But as an American, I found it insulting in the worst way--the author feels an admiration and affection for us, but it is the type of ""pat the dog on the head"" type of affection or, maybe more precisely, the type of affection a master felt for his slaves in this country in the days of the old South: ""my darkeys, I love them so; they sing so sweet and are as dumb and gentle as children"". And if you are of an Irish Nationalist bent, it is even worse and more insulting. It's too bad because the idea was good, the writing is excellent; it is just poorly executed.",0
The concept of this book was interesting to me but this book is boring. The characters are one dimensional and the main character is lame. I decided not to finish it after reading other reviews that say it is a waste of time (I got about half way through).,0
"He has really lost a few steps, and I am thinking he really doesn't know where he's going with these characters.  That, or he just doesn't know how to get there.  Make us wait five more years for a book, and you may as well read it yourself; to wait this long for a book I have to force myself to finish is not encouraging at all.",0
"I have long loved the movie version of Ice Station Zebra, which I first saw in my teens when the film was fairly new. I had been promising to buy and read the novel for many years now, and finally decided that this year's summer vacation was the ideal time.I honestly wish I'd never bothered.The writing in the first part of the book is so slow I almost gave up. The characters are not believable and the situation is unconvincing and farcically so by turns.I'm not by any means a demanding reader but in light of my finally reading the book I have to say it is a mystery to me why anyone would option it for a film. The story as written could not be filmed due to suspension of disbelief problems and hackneyed and unbelievable ""I know what's going on but I'm not going to tell you just yet"" behavior of the guest aboard the submarine, used to keep the story going because without that it would collapse around itself.I recommend people stick to the film for the best telling of the events at Ice Station Zebra.",0
"Too many personas, too many events, too many quirky sudden changes and revelation, too few plot advances, to meaty cliffhangers...",0
"The first three books were page turners and I enjoyed most of the fourth installment.  Unfortunately, ADWD is somewhat of a bore.  The details and numerous characters are fine, but the story is told from too many perspectives which waters down the storytelling.  Early in the series, the original characters were so well-crafted, so real that they really became alive and got under my skin.  By this fifth book, it seems more like an accounting of everything rather than a story.  Nothing really happens.  I can honestly say, it wouldn't have taken away much to simply read a synopsis and skip this book altogether.  Martin needs to consider how frustrating this is to those who've read and enjoyed the first books since who else would buy the fifth?",0
What a long and boring book.  Loved the first four but this book jumps around and nothing is finished.  What the heck!  Is Mr. Martin losing it?  I'm sorry I bought it.,0
"This is a re-post and a revision of a review on this book that I put up in 2006, and which has somehow disappeared off Amazon. At any rate...I'm a fanatic about anything dealing with Henry VIII, and when I saw ""The Other Boleyn Girl,"" I looked forward to reading it. I liked the premise that Gregory suggested -- describing the story of the doomed Anne Boleyn, Henry VIII's second wife, through the eyes of her sister, Mary Boleyn Carey Stafford.I'm sorry I wasted my time on this book, but am thankful I didn't waste my money. Gregory's research is decent -- unlike other reviewers, I realize this is ""fiction,"" meaning the author can do whatever she thinks makes sense. The lack of blow-by-blow history didn't bother me. What did was that the characterizations were trite and one-dimensional, with the major players in the novel thoroughly unlikeable.Anne Boleyn isn't regarded favorably by many scholars for many reasons, some of which were justified, others not. But Gregory's interpretation of Anne as evil and arrogance extraordinaire was a little much, even for those who find plenty to dislike about her. In other fictional accounts about Anne Boleyn, most authors have the good sense to make her a sympathetic character, at least near the end. Getting beheaded can tend to put a character in a sympathetic light. But in ""The Other Boleyn Girl,"" the portrayal of Anne was so dreadful, I was almost glad when she lost her head at the end of the book.But Anne wasn't the only one that suffered in this novel. The portrait of the entire Boleyn family was dull and one-dimensional, like something out of a bad soap opera. Instead of painting a ruthless picture of an ambitious family trying to claw its way to the throne, Gregory decided to formulate Mamma and Papa Boleyn as a Simon Legree type, throwing Mary to the wolves whenever and wherever possible. The portrayals were so theatrical and overblown, it was almost funny.Then there's Mary, who was really hard to like. I wanted to see some backbone in Mary, as she was not only the heroine, but the narrator. But she was portrayed as a wimp, rather than a pawn with a mind of her own. A flakey, whiney, hard-to-like character. And I have to agree with another review I read -- the position Gregory put Mary in at the end of the book stretched the bounds of credibility of even the loosest historical fiction.About the only redeeming quality was the author's portrayal of George Boleyn, Anne and Mary's brother. George, at least, had some fire and facets to his personality, unlike his sisters.In all, I'm wondering how this actually ended up in the hands of a movie producer and actually made it to the theaters with such a stellar cast. The plot has always lended itself to making a good movie. But in this effort, Gregory just didn't do well.",0
"This was a book club assignment, I had not wanted to read this book because I had heard that there was some animal cruelty but as a member I try to appreciate other peoples book choices as they do mine.The cruelty was a little hard to read, especially the beatings of Rosie but I also found myself cringing at the unneccessary sex scenes that were over the top, boredom at the constant threat of tossing people of the train and disbelief at the stampede of the menagerie.I did like the elderly Jacob and his life at the nursing home, I think it shows how elderly people are often ""put on the shelf"" when they become a bother in life...so sad.  Then this was spoilt by the idea that he ran away with the circus, was able to sell tickets even if he could not button his shirt and all with the acceptance of the current circus owner.I am sure the circus of that era was not a pleasant place but I think the characters could have been much better developed and the story a little less unbelievable.",0
I do not really understand how could all of the reviewers recommend this book. I did not think it was that good it was rather slow and sorry to say boring.If you have read many books by Agatha Christie and want to read  this book go ahead but you might not like because it is not so  thrilling.If you really want to read some good stuff by Mrs Christie go  for &quot;The Secret adversery&quot; a tommy and Tuppence mystery it is not  really bad and you might like it.If you want to read good mysteries I  would recommend Georges Simenon's Maigret's Novels they are really good and  M. Simenon is big time better than Mrs Christie (sorry to say that but try  and see),0
"I think George R. R. Martin was hungry when he wrote A Dance with Dragons. It's odd, but the thing I remember is page after page describing food. The problem is that outside of eating, the characters really don't do anything else. Indeed, it's the only thing they can do while traveling from one spot to another. The problem is that they never seem to reach their destinations. Other than the ending, there's a whole bunch of nothing going on. Quite a disappointment for everyone who waited years for this tome. Even Tyrion can't save this stinker.I was really hopeful that the previous book, A Feast for Crows, was the rare rotten exception to this otherwise fantastic series, but sadly, it wasn't. The series has become way too fragmented and unfocused. Martin has become a victim of his own success, seemingly unable to edit anything from this lengthy volume. I rarely say this, but I think the TV show will be better than the book. So far, HBO has managed to do a superb job in whittling down a lot of Martin's narrative bloat.I think it says everything that I bought this book the day it came out and it wasn't until almost a year later when I forced myself to finish it. Sadly, it became a chore. I'm still a fan and hope Martin can rekindle the series in the next volume, but I'm afraid it might have already jumped the shark.",0
"...since writing this series in 1984.Fresh from reading the Lions of Al-Rassan (pub. 1995), the Sarantine Mosaic (pub. 1998),  and the Last Light of the Sun (pub. 2004), with their subtle plots and characters, richly crafted world and religions, I thought that Kay could do nothing wrong.  Boy, was I ever wrong.All the above qualities are glaringly absent here.Instead of subtle characters, we have 5 heroes who constantly, and at length, reflect on their FEELINGS.  Yet, they manage to carry off all that tedious introspection without ever, well, coming to life.  The contrast with George RR Martin or later Kay POV passages could not be more marked.  For example, if I was a Toronto college student, suddenly lured on false premises into a deadly war, I would be quite a bit more upset and concerned about my safety than these guys.  Though maybe not quite as much as say, a Thomas Covenant (whose lengthy self-examinations, while repetitive, also make a lot more sense).In later books, Kay will sometimes end a chapter with something like ""And he suddenly realized what he had to do"" and leave you reflecting on which possible decision the protagonist will choose, based on all the insight you have into his behavior and motivations.In Fionavar, these cliffhangers happen much more frequently.  Likely as not, the protagonist will then, for no reason at all, based on no information known to the reader, run off to a location not yet introduced, to do something earthshaking entirely out of the blue.  Perhaps the characters behave that way because they are destined to do so.  The role of fate, personified by the Tapestry, becomes more pronounced in the concluding book of the trilogy.  Yet, that is a subtle point and hardly justifies the inane storywriting throughout.Fionavar itself has a cliche good-vs-evil backstory, ""inspired"" by Tolkien and Celtic legends.  Geographically, characters zoom off from one end to the other in hours, by teleportation if necessary, to further the ""plot"".  The result is that you it feels more like an adventure around a big city/theme park and its surroundings than a real world, with real features and real people.  The religious aspect involves various gods frequently interacting with mortals and Rakoth Maugrim, the bad guy, makes Sauron look like an in depth character study.Everything comes off as archetypical, rather than realistic.  That might have been the intent, but did not make this series any more pleasurable for me.  I really can't say that Kay should be ashamed of it, because he has since matured into one of Fantasy's best writers.  But Fiorana was not a promising start by any means.  And no, books 2 and 3 aren't all that much better either.",0
"Review '48Apocalyptic ActionThis story is about an alternate history where the Germans launch a devastating biological attack using V-2 rockets.  It is in the final days of the war in 1945 and Hitler's Reich is finished so he launches a virus that very well may kill off humanity.  The virus for some reason does not effect people with ABneg blood.Flash forward 3 years and the story begins.  The protagonist is an American who came to England as a volunteer fighter pilot to help the war effort.  He has been holed up at the Savoy, a fancy hotel with his trusted dog companion.  Immediately, his location is found and he is soon running for his life.  The bad guys are called the Black-Shirts.  They wear, you guessed it, black shirts and they have the virus and are slowly dying.  Yes, not all people affected died immediately.  The black shirts believe in their fascist leader and his belief that they can survive by performing a blood transfusion from someone who has ABneg blood.  The American hero of the story meets up with a few other survivors including an escaped German POW, a working class pub girl, and a upper class previously rich girl.The rest of the story is mostly boredom as they hole up somewhere and you are told in great detail the layout of the room and given detailed tedious descriptions of every piece of furniture and item in sight followed by being discovered and running and action and shooting and so on.  I'm not impressed at all by this book.  Because I like apocalyptic fiction, I refrained from giving it only one star since the idea is not bad.",0
"A lot of people waited a long time for this book.  When it finally arrived, and was as long as it was, I expected something to happen.  Very little did.  It drags, big time.  Now the wait for the next installment, which may never happen.",0
"This book was absolutely terrible.  I had seen some Clancy movies and thought I would enjoy one of his books.  Boy was I wrong.  I'll never read another again.  The characters were so one dimensional.  The &quot;hero&quot; was, in my opinion, a cold-blooded killer who was as bad as the &quot;psychopaths&quot; he was out to get.  He actually tortured one of the bad guys to death.  It was also apparent that he couldn't be without a woman.  During the six months between the time his beloved wife died and he met his new love, he &quot;visited&quot; hookers twice.  He then fell in love (in a matter of hours) with a hitchhiker he picked up.  Within a week after she was gone, he glommed on to the nurse who treated his wounds in the hospital.  Everyone in the book was either all black or all white.  I don't have one good thing to say about this book.  Hard to believe this author actually made money from this junk.",0
"Wouldn't you think that after reading the boring book four I'd have had the brains enough not to buy book 5? In my own defense I have to say that somewhere or other I got the notion that book 5 would end the series, and so I bought it, just to see how it ended. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that this waste of time and money still has two more books to go before the series mercifully ends.I have managed to wade through 300 pages of A Dance with Dragons and cannot bring myself to finish this seemingly endless mess of going nowhere. I almost said ""going nowhere fast,"" but in fact, A Dance with Dragons goes nowhere painfully sloooowly.What happened to the forward momentum that drove the first three books? What happened to characters we care about? What happened to--oh, never mind, if I keep this up it'll end up as long-winded as the book.",0
"It's probably no accident Alistair MacLean's literary career rose to widespread prominence at the same time as commercial air travel. MacLean was the ultimate airplane fiction writer, someone whose picaresque, globe-trotting adventure novels could be devoured in a single sitting.He might be remembered for thin characters and wooden dialogue, but it was MacLean's fast-paced narrative, often very alive and tactile, that gained him fans. Something else, too; he had a formula but a lot of creativity within that formula, an ability to develop gripping stories by putting his good-guy-bad-guy adventure yarns in unusual settings and situations. In that way he was a lot better than many give him credit for.Unfortunately, MacLean's mobile imagination didn't always produce great fiction, which leads us to ""Caravan To Vaccares."" A mysterious fellow named Bowman shadows a group of mysterious, murderous Gypsies around the south of France. He jokingly explains his motives to his companion Cecile as being those of ""a vengeful layabout,"" but what he's really up to is left opaque.Adding to the chemistry of mood here is a group of mysterious women being held captive by the Gypsies, one with weals covering her back; a Chinese couple that appear and disappear at several points in the narrative, saying nothing but watching everything; a charging bull; and a French duke of marked appetite and hauteur who may not be as much of a neutral observer as he seems.""Le Grand Duc,"" as he is called, is the most interesting character in ""Caravan,"" and MacLean has fun with him. Bursting in on a budding hostage situation, he is told he can't just barge in.""Nonsense. I am the Duc de Croytor. Besides, I never barge. I always make an entrance.""""Caravan"" is nonsense, though fun at times around the middle when MacLean gets going with a clever reverse chase between Bowman and the Gypsies. He's chasing them chasing him. There's a good opening, too, of a Gypsy's murder, which MacLean paints darkly and well.But as the story progresses, it becomes harder to follow. MacLean gets caught up in the sport of playing with reader expectations. You think one thing is going to happen, so something else does instead. Nearly every character has a hidden identity; one has two. The back end of ""Caravan"" becomes one confusing about-face after another, winding up in a too-cute tidy resolution with one character calling out ""Encore!"" No thanks.Also weak is the Gypsy angle, which is never explored in any great depth. You feel like he made the bad guys Gypsies just because it would make for good cover art.I was amused by some of this book, and enjoyed its first half pretty well. But a thin setting and confusing narrative really brought me up short. I had no problem reading the book; it's MacLean, and something to make a flight pass quickly. But ""Caravan To Vaccares"" is the kind of book that gives airplane fiction a bad name.",0
"I can say in all honesty this is the worst book I have read in many years; I wish I could rate it ""one-quarter star.""  I only finished the book because I was on a 14-hour flight across the Pacific Ocean with nothing else to do.  The writing is of extraordinarily poor quality, aimed at about a 6th-grade reading level.  Worse, it seeks to make the heroine seem better than she was by degrading every other female around, particularly female family members.  The main target for her vitriol is Anne Boleyn, who is portrayed as a psychotic monster (who eagerly has a long-term affair with her own brother, an accusation that no one else seriously believes).  The author's twisted hatred makes one wonder if the author has a sister she hates, or possibly she hates all women on the planet and blames them for all her own personal problems.The book portrays Mary as a sweet innocent, the only good woman in England.  In reality, Mary Boleyn was sent as a young girl to the French court as a lady in waiting.  She became a notorious international laughingstock because of her extreme promiscuity and lack of common sense and was brought home in disgrace.  Her horrible reputation as beyond ""easy,"" as well as her extreme youth and stupidity, temporarily appealed to Henry VIII.  He used her, got her pregnant, and instantly forgot her existence.  It was her bad example that caused Anne to hesitate so long before giving in to Henry.The bad writing gets truly laughable in the ""sexy"" scenes and later scenes showing Mary ""playing house"" - - finding true happiness as the poor farmer's wife, with a smile on her face and a song in her heart in her jolly, neat little cottage, having fun learning to cook and clean and milk the cows - - at a time when a real, impoverished farmwife would be doing backbreaking work 14 hours a day, fighting for survival.  How about a reality check here!  In fact, one of the reasons I picked the book up in the first place was because I was hoping for some factual information on Mary's later marriage - - I know she married a commoner, not a wealthy man, but how poor were they?  I assume he was a gentleman farmer with servants.  It seems incredible that a member of the aristocracy would gladly and merrily move to a life of poverty, which would involve extreme hardship and not the fun and games the author stupidly portrays.  If Mary really married a poor man and had to do all the work, it would have been a horrifying and shocking learning experience on her part, true culture shock, and not the joyful romp portrayed in this silly book.All in all, this is a ridiculous and offensive book, insulting to anyone with intelligence and to any woman with any self respect.",0
"didnt establish a good flow of occurances and was just unrealistic characters. He just didnt make the characters act in any realistic fasion, even for fantasy writing",0
"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. I have to admit I did not finish it. It was simultaneously boring, cliched, badly written and trite. Oh and repetitive. The only redeeming feature of the book was the parts where Jacob was an old man. If the author could write like that more consistently then she would be on to something. I cannot figure out why people love this book so much. If you compare it to another recently very popular book, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, at least that book was riveting, even though it was also not very well written. I am not looking for Faulkner, but if a book is not high literature it should at least have a compelling plot. This book had neither neither good writing style nor an interesting plot. Don't waste your time.",0
"Just like a fish, I was hooked with the first three books and now I'm writhing in pain, just trying to get away. The last two parts, including ""A Dance With Dragons,"" have failed to capture my imagination like the series originally did. The books have morphed into the ""Oregon Trail"" game. It just feels like Martin is walking in circles to nowhere, moving in slow motion, gradually killing off every core character in the process. Unfortunately, just like thousands (or perhaps millions) of others, I'll still probably purchase the final books, just so I don't feel like I've completely wasted my time reading the others. I fear by the end, though, just like all of Martin's characters, I will have died of dysentery.",0
"Sara Gruen did exhaustive research for her novel, Water for Elephants. But all went for naught to this reader. The story never became real to me. The characters were pasteboard figures. I was aware of the author too much, behind the scenes, pulling the levers.

"I hate you, George RR Martin. You are an evil, sadistic little man, aren't you?First I had to go through Feast for Crows without my favorite characters. I actually thought they were going to be right around the corner up until the last page when - surprise! I find out they were moved to the next book. Okay. ""No problem,"" I said. ""I'll wait, Georgey Porgey. But it better be good.""But it wasn't. Oh, how it wasn't. (He made this girl cry.)There seems to be a huge misconception that this is actually reading material, judging by how the average rating isn't 1 star.How does someone start a series so magnificently and then deteriorate so magnificently quickly?The problem here is that NOT ENOUGH HAPPENS. Phrases are repeated until you want to smash your book or reading device with a hammer. Tyrion keeps ""taking a piss.""SPOILER ALERT? DOES IT MATTER? Tyrion spends the entire book just /traveling/ to where Daenerys is. At first you think, cool! Daenerys gets to meet Tyrion! But then you just forget that that was ever his destination. And Cersei? I think she got her comeuppance in this book, but really all I remember is where do whores go? You know nothing, Jon Snow. I'mma take a piss off the boat now.",0
"Trying her hand at writing into occultism and supernatural subjects, Agatha Christie failed to provoke new insights nor deliver any entertainment value.Several stories were outrightly occultic, such as the Hound of Death.  These have got nothing to do with crimes.A couple of other stories such as the Blue Jar have some crime involved, and could be considered readable.What mystery and crime readers would normally expect from Agatha Christie was a thorough investigation of the paranormal, sifting the clues and evidence, and exhaust all possibilities before leaving it as ... unexplainable by known facts.  Had Agatha Christie done that, the stories would have been much much more readable.",0
"This book is a real drag. The Slave Bay faux-exoticism was tolerable when it came in small doses, but a book dominated by it makes for a grueling read. It takes the first half of this book to catch all of the less interesting characters up with the storyline from the previous book. Very little goes on during this time, however. Just angst and indecision - 500 pages worth of it. The second half of the book is about ten times better, and the last quarter has some genuinely exciting moments. It would take a lot more to make up for the slog that is the first half, though. It doesn't help that Martin has become extremely predictable. Setups are dangled before the reader and then dashed to the ground (does anyone fall for the prospect of the good guys winning even a small battle anymore?), characters are wantonly killed and then resurrected so often that all of the deaths in the book lose their impact. Introducing a character and then killing them before they can do anything worthwhile has become tiresome, as well. I'm sure that I'll still pick up the next book when it comes out, but I won't have much in the way of expectations.",0
"I read a lot of science fiction, and typically enjoy books that work in good hardcore science, be it real, theoretical, or fantastical.  This book manages to come up with a few of each.  There is a great deal devoted to the science of terraforming mars into human habitable environment, and the process of human surviving in the harsh enviroment that exists today.  Honestly though, Robinson would have done better writing a non-fiction essay on Mars habitation than this poor effort at a fictional story.The characters and plot lines are blurry and disinteresting.  Time takes decades long leaps, with little warning and it became confusing and tedious.I had to force myself to finish it, and there is little danger of my reading the next two books in the series, or anything else from Robinson for that matter.",0
This book was a quick read and a creative idea. But it was dry. It could and should have been elaborated on. It seemed as though the author was bored with writing it. Granted there were times of strong emotion but for the most part it was just lacking in all aspects.,0
"This series is a straightforward space opera (interplanetary traders, pirates, space police, icky aliens) with a nod to high opera--Wagner's Ring des Nibelungen cycle, to be precise. Unfortunately, Donaldson, whose writing sparkles here as it has in his other books (particularly the first Thomas Covenant series) has latched on to a genre that is stale and leavens it with  touches that are creepy at best and at work downright unpleasant.This volume (which is the best in the series) follows the misadventures of a young space cadet named Morn Hyland. She's a junior pilot on a huge family-owned freighter. When her ship comes out of 'the Gap' (read warp/lightspeed/whatever), everyone on the ship but her is killed. A pirate/scavenger named Angus Thermopyle, a sleeze-ball of the first order, take her aboard, has his way with her, and is eventually arrested when he pulls in to a space station for repairs. That's the &quot;Real Story&quot;.... or is it? Donaldson plays a Rashomon-like game, going back and retelling the story in greater depth, more close to the character's point of view, revealing that what really happened may have been something quite different. We get to watch Morn raped and degraded. And Morn raped and degraded. And Morn raped and degraded. Angus displays all sorts of neurotic soul, so we're supposed to come to sympathise with him--that we almost do is a tribute to Donaldson's writing skills, which is why I even give The Real Story 2 stars--but the fact of the matter is that this is a book about abusing a woman who never appears as more than a victim or a cypher. I read, somewhere, that Donaldson wrote this series during and immediately following his divorce. If so, I feel his pain, but I really would rather that I hadn't read the book. I went on to read the rest of the series, waiting for some kind of redemption, but aside from the fun of identifying characters from the Ring cycle in various spacers and magnates, it's more scenes of Morn being raped and degraded, literally or figuratively.As science fiction, it's stale; as softcore S&amp;M porn (a genre I must admit to being much less well read in) it's flat. For either, go elsewhere.",0
"Little Miss Muffit sat on her tuffit eating her curds and whey. Along Came a Spider and sat down beside her and bored her to tears! This book was o.k., but nowhere near as good as the other Alex Cross novels. The only  reason why I do reccomend it is beacuse of the continuation in Cat and  Mouse. Otherwise, I would have said avoid it all together.",0
"Serious lack of writing talent - it felt like it was written as a wannabe screen play. Completely lacking in any subtlety, insight or technique.  Interesting for a teenage mind maybe but not for anyone who really enjoys a well written book that doesn't just lay it all out on the table for you",0
"Several years ago I read ""A Game of thrones"". I simply loved it. Martin created a world that was alive and more real than our own because, unlike most books of the genre, both the narrative and characterization were realistic even if the setting was a world where each season lasted several decades.""A Dance with Dragons"" in comparison, but also on its own, is a pretty bad book, a promise unfulfilled. In a thousand pages the characters of this book travel thousands of miles: they depart from nowhere and they arrive nowhere too. I don't want to spoil anything but one new character seemed to be created only because Martin is running out of characters to kill and he still has, apparently, two books to go.He created a Red Shirt.This was a great series but the last two books were a disaster worse, they were boring. It pains me a lot buy I only gave it one star because that is the lowest rating available.",0
"As I read this book, I had the feeling that Clancy has fallen prey to his own legend. The book seemed to be two separate stories pressed into one volume--as though Clancy had the material for two distinct 500-page books, and then said to himself, &quot;But I'm Tom Clancy! I can't write a book this short!&quot; and shoehorned them into a single plotline. The effect is disjointed, and results in a book that doesn't quite hang together.More troubling is the character of Jack Ryan. In this book, he expresses so much idealism and naivite as to sound unintelligent. It is absurd that a CIA analyst would be shocked at political machinations within the government. Indeed, I had the impression that Jack was a little surprised that his country _had_ a government. I can't imagine that Clancy meant to make his hero sound so ignorant, but that's the effect.Between the rambling and the bumbling, I'm put off of future Jack Ryan novels. It's too bad, because most of them were great. But for my money, stick a fork in Clancy; he's done.",0
"For a novel about a very dirty, ugly conflict in WWII - this book is strangely woven with a humorous thread. It could have been so much more - oh well.  Not recommended. Read Circus or Guns.",0
"Some parts are entertaining enough, but left me wanting more. Lacking in character development. Predictable with a thin story line. Skip it. Better stuff out there to read.",0
"I'm embarrassed to admit I read this. So why am I confessing? Maybe it's good therapy. Unbelievable characters. Trite dialog. Flat out stupid plot. And the worst thing is, the 4 book ""series"" that this begins isn't so much a series of 4 books, but 1 big lame book split into 4 installments. A real series would have distinct stories, a beginning and an end, with some sense of completion to each. This reads like a TV mini-series complete with a cliffhanger at the end of each night's episode.So, if I hated it so much, why 2 stars instead of 1? Somehow the author managed to trick me into reading every book. I got to the end of the first and thought ""oh that was awful, I have to read the next one.""Take my advice and avoid this like crack: it's easier never to start than to try to stop.",0
"For the first half of this book, I enjoyed the author's wit and storytelling quite a bit. Any writer who has the courage to expose the anthropomorphic absurdities of the animal rights movement has my eager attention. But the second half of the book didn't quite work for me. It seemed like scene after scene of characters discussing the situation rather than anything really taking place. After the twentieth phone conversation between two characters telling each other what they'd found out or arranging meetings over dinner, I began to get a little impatient. Indeed, the most action-packed scene in the second half of the book involves retrieving an escaped cat. By the time I got to the solution of the mystery--which seemed to come out of nowhere and had little to do with the theme of the book--I really didn't care that much anymore. I appreciate the author's willingness to satirize so many political points of view--on both sides of the pond--and Baroness Troutbeck was a hoot, but I would have liked a little less conversation and a little more action.",0
"This book looks interesting, but I 'd rather say I was dissappointed, having read almost all Christie's books.Get it only if you plan to collect every Agatha book. If you are a newbie in the Christie world or you want only the tops, this isn't for you.",0
"This is a tedious by-the-numbers revenge fantasy written by Clancy or Clancy's team of writers (it's hard to tell which, I suspect his better and earlier books were his and his alone). In a nutshell Jack Ryan is a former Navy SEAL badass (sound familiar yet?) who falls for a junkie hooker who then gets killed by her drug dealer. So he skulks around Baltimore executing people connected with her murder.This story has been done better by countless other writers...",0
"Story line lacked credibility unlike many of Clancy's books.  Reading the book it occurred to me , gee, he must be getting paid by the word.  I was disappointed.",0
"This book is a short novella masquerading as a bloated tome.  It desperately needs harsh and impartial editing.Even if you like the series, you can skip this one in favor of reading the spoilers in the reviews here.  Or perhaps just read the last 150 pages to get the cliffhangers, but they aren't really cliffhangers since their outcomes have been so heavily foreshadowed you know what will happen.",0
"There should be a warning on books like this! With all the good reviews I thought it would be a good book, so I checked it out from my library. There are porn scenes in this book, so I stopped reading and returned it right away. I do not want to read stuff like that.",0
Terrible book. The inaccuracies of the book that other reviewers point out don't bother me so much. It is fiction. I am bothered by how the author writes and I felt zero interest in any of the characters. I read about 225 pages and had to stop. I just felt myself getting stupid with every page.,0
Unless the author wanted it to be so deadpan from the beginning that I could not get to anything interesting I see no reason to make myself suffer anymore of the book.DELETE,0
"I found the book very interesting....well at least the historical part of it.  I enjoyed Flashman recounting his experience, and the tongue in cheek nature of his swindling, cowardly nature.  So for this part of the book I would give it 4 stars (maybe even 5).But I found his womanizing so distasteful that I won't read any more of the series and couldn't recommend it to anyone.  I found his unending attempts to use women (seducing, beating if they refused him, and out right rape) so distasteful that I gave it the two star rating (and since I would never read another in the series because of this-even if given free, maybe this should be a one star rating)",0
"Having now finished reading all five volumes of A Song of Ice and Fire, I find myself frustrated, like many others, at the glacial pace (how ironically appropriate) of the plot development, or at least any significant plot development.  For make no mistake, George Martin has a unbridled penchant for weaving interminable plot expansion  with infinite character development until your ready to scream ""Enough!""  Yet somehow it manages to hold your interest through five thousand some pages, though that interest in now being sorely tried as things drag on and on and on.I am also beginning to tire of the horrific world Mr. Martin has created.  It appears to have no redeeming social, moral or other value other than titillating one's libido or vicariously satisfying one's blood lust.  It is next to impossible to really like or identify with any of the main characters with the possible exception of Jon Snow and Arya.  This contempt, or is it cynicism disguised as realism, certainly separates Martin from the likes of Tolkien and Brooks and most other fantasy writers of note.  It does work in the first three books, but is beginning to wear by volumes 4 and 5.  One begins to hope the dragons will level the whole fracking place!",0
"I was required to read this for a book club. I finally gave up.  I am an avid reader (2-3 books per week) and after almost 2 weeks, I gave up.  Thank goodness, I wasn't the only one at book club who couldn't get through it.  VERY tedious....",0
This book helped me remember the &#8220;good old days&#8220;. It was fun remembering how cheap things used to be. Sara helped me see what awaits me in the coming years of my life. It is a great read.,0
"This book does not deviate from the formula that has made Clancy a successful writer.  There are actually two or three plot lines going on at once, that all tie together in the end.  The downside of this method is the same in this book as it is in his others as well.  Interesting beginning, followed by several hundred pages of less than interesting material, followed by an exciting finish.  It works well in some cases, however this book seemed to lack the suspense that his other novels have.  There were a few twists and turns at the end, but nothing too surprising.My other criticism of Clancy's book is the same as my other reviews.  Too much profanity and the repeated use of violent rape scenes to move the plot along.  That's not entertaining to me.  If it wasn't for the fact that I already have his books sitting on my bookshelf, I wouldn't be reading any more Tom Clancy.",0
"Having been a Clancy fan from his beginning, when I picked up Executive Orders, I hoped to find the same class of writing and pleasant presentation as had been the mark of (most) of his prior work..Unfortunately, it seems he had either reached that pinnacle where he could demand he get paid on a ""per word"" basis, thus the incredible and completely unnecessary length of this work - or he had offended all possible editors of skill, and been left with a very inferior pool to choose from.  I'd find it hard to explain this ineffective work otherwise, clearly published on the hope of the merit of the Clancy name and not on any intrinsic merits of its own..This is one ponderous book...one that I had a very hard time working through.  It could have been fully and effectively covered with half the size, resulting in a much more readable and productive Clancy gripper...easier to follow, more demonstrative of the points he wanted to make, and more conducive to continuing his future unblemished..Though I must say I thought I saw it coming in a couple of his works leading up to this one, at least they were still effecive and noteworthy, though beginning to be somewhat needlessly long..It is my hope that we don't have a repeat of this exercise in literary back-sliding, and that Mr. Clancy continues to use other writers to assist him in putting his works together as he's been doing since, to keep him from the mistakes he made here.",0
"The story follows Jacob Jankowski, who is living out the rest of his life in a rest home.  When he was 23, he was poised to become a veterinarian.  However, fate stepped in and he left school.  He ended up joining a traveling circus, where he assisted with the menagerie.  During this time, he falls in love with Marlena, who is a performer in the show and also married to the ringleader.I will say that Gruen is gifted in her ability to create imagery.  You can see the animals and feel the angst that the circus employees go through under their sadistic leaders.  That being said, I can't say that Marlena is a well-developed character.  I don't feel as though we know why Jacob fell in love with her, beyond the fact that she was beautiful and cared about her animals.  It feels as though that part of the story was left out.And why is August, Marlena's husband, so evil? It does sound as though he suffers from some mental issues, but what is the background on him?I just couldn't fall in love with these characters nor the story.",0
"5 years was way too long to wait for A Dance With Dragons.  I'll give GRRM the benefit of the doubt that he knows what he's doing with the series that started out so promising; but only for one more book.  If the next is no better than Feast or Dance, I'll not read another.  Well, at least not in hardcover....  Compared to the first three in the series, this, well, sucks.  The only reason it's better than A Feast for Crows is that we don't have 30 new characters 3500 pages into the story.  But one can't help but wonder if Martin is as lost as Jordan became?  If so, he's taken what was the best series outside LOTR and turned it to so=so, hum drum mismash.  What a shame that would be.GRRM, if you are reading this, please, please, please, get the story moving again.  Your fans have suffered through the last two, please don't make them regret their investment in Song.",0
"It appears as though I'm in the minority once again.  All of us are entitled to our own thoughts and opinions but for the life of me I can't understand the number of 5 star ratings given to this book.  I'm not even sure I feel good about giving it a two.I wanted to like the book.  Really.  Who doesn't love a cute, little, old man telling his story of the good ol' days?  But as endearing as the concept was, I couldn't get past the fact that I honestly didn't care that much about any of the characters.  Sorry but it had to be said.  The characters were flat, the story was more fantasy than fiction and worst of all, the whole thing felt quite familiar.  It was only later that it occured to me that this story was trying very hard to be Fried Green Tomatoes and/or Driving Miss Daisy; the difference is that I actually cared about the characters in those stories.  Frankly, Water for Elephants read more like a screenplay than a great novel.For my friends, I would suggest:If you want a story of reflection - The Green Mile, Driving Miss Daisy, Fried Green TomatoesIf you want a story about elephants - Hannah's DreamIf you want a story about a circus - well, I've got no idea.  :)Having said all of that, I would like to see the movie.  As stated before, this read like a screenplay -- bare bones, generally just waiting for someone to bring life to the characters and story.",0
"I hate so say it, but I'm done with this series. George has killed off most of the good characters and I really don't feel like getting invested in another character that may have been mentioned three books ago that I have no recollection of. The only interesting one left is Aria and you could write one good book about her alone. I do not care to wait eight or so years for the next book.",0
got the sample for my kindle and loved it.  bought it.  then it got raunchy.  alot of bad language and vulgar descriptions.  I just wish all that had been in the sample so I wouldn't have wasted my money buying the book!,0
"The reason why virtually all of this man's novels are on the New York Time's bestseller list is because they are all politically correct to the extreme -- brilliant black psychologists and heroines , racist police and villains, heroic Black figures assasinated by racists.You can only go so far before you start to delude reality and make the book unbelievable and James Patterson certainly does that, particularly in this book.",0
"Would've been an appropriate title.I am so disgusted with myself for the amount of time I wasted reading this book. I can't even imagine how disgusted George Martin must be with himself for the amount of time he wasted writing it.Jon Snow dead? Who knows, who cares any more. I'm finished with this series. Mr. Martin, do us a favor and stop writing - it's unbearable.",0
"I can see why people would love this book, but it wasn't for me. Having read and fallen in love with the Farseer Trilogy, and then the Tawny Man Trilogy, I was thrilled to hear of another series set in the same world, and ordered book one of the Liveship Traders immediately.I got to about page 60, before I really decided to give up. Knowing that there was a whole other two books as well as this one, and not at all enjoying much of it so far, I decided not to waste my time.The problem with this book is that it reads, mostly, like a collection of character profiles and backstories. Huge, huge info-dumps. It's called character development, I suppose, but it's not at all how I like to see characters established.The writing was good, excellent, as is Hobb's standard. But I was bored, immensely so. And there just didn't seem to be an actual plot that was important enough to hold my interest. Everything felt like a kinda side-story, but I'm not sure where the meat and action was supposed to be.I was very much dissapointed having expected great things from this series after reading Farseer. But Liveship is completely different and not nearly as good.",0
This book was over-rated and extremely boring!  The characters were not relateable and I had to stop reading half way  through.,0
"Briefly...sorely disappointed in this. Maybe I lost interest over the long years in-between, but I SO looked forward to it based on the previous books, and sad to say this one was returned after trying t slog through just 150 pages! No more fantasy series for me, because this book proved they never know when to end. What a grave disappointment.",0
"It begins well and is intriguing, but then loses its depth. I did not care about  any of the characters because there was no depth to them either. Adam is completely unlikeable and Erskine never really goes into detail the relationship of all the characters enough in order for me to care about them. The ending of this book was also lousy.",0
"It  took me 6 months to finish this book because it was so convoluted and boring. Seriously, GRRM, it took you 5 years to come up with this?Don't buy it, wait for the HBO series which will hopefully have diverged significantly from the books by then",0
"I wanted to like this book, but I could not. Maclean seems to have an encyclopedic knowledge of life aboard a cruiser, but the naval strategy that drives the book seems nonsensical. Go read C.S. Forrester's ""The Ship"" to see a better handling of life aboard a ship in battle.*** SPOILERS ***But the real problem with this particular book is that almost every single character is killed off. They either have a spectacularly gruesome death, or die in an act of suicidal bravery, or more likely both. How much of this can you take as reader? There's not a single bright spot in this whole book. Every time you think the mood is lifting with some character redeeming himself by an heroic act he is either blown to smithereens or frozen to death within a page or two.There's not even any logic to it all. The idea that the Admiralty would sacrifice an entire convoy just to draw out the Tirpitz is stupid. The goal of the Admiralty was to get convoys through, not sink German warships. It's the convoys that would win the war.I think Maclean was on some sort of medication when he wrote this. It's a complete downer from start to finish.",0
"I have been waiting impatiently for this book for a LONG time, but I feel like it is taking me twice as long as I spent waiting just to plow through this book.  The characters are still very interesting, but not a lot is happening in Dance of Dragons.  I'm about 85% of the way through the book, but the story line hasn't been advanced by much at all, and I'm pretty sure that this series can't be concluded without a lot more books, if they are all going to be this slow.  And, sorry, Mr. Martin, I don't want to wait as long as it would take for you to write that many more books!Also, the book has a lot of typos - especially the word ""then"" when ""than"" should have been used.  Sloppy editing, but I'm pretty sure it wouldn't have been so irritating if I had been less bored.",0
"""Water for Elephants is fiction"", but the author clearly did her research, and so it's solidly based on the sad realities of life for both humans and animals working in circuses during the Depression.  But sadly, animal circuses haven't changed much since that time.  Human workers may no longer be ""redlighted"", but captive wild animals are still packed into buses or trains without heat in winter or air conditioning in summer, imprisoned in cages or chained up, forced to perform demeaning tricks for the public, and given generally substandard, if any, medical care and often, not enough nourishment.Gruen can tell a story, she has vivid characters, she presented the animal characters in a sympathetic and favorable light, and I enjoyed the read.  But I have to say that to me, the happy ending of Jacob and Marlena finding employment with Ringling Brothers so they can bring Rosie, Bobo and the horses along with them is anything but.  Admittedly, for those times, it may have been the only option open to them, and there were few if any animal protection advocates out there exposing circuses like Ringling.  The truth is that Ringling Brothers has a long history of well-documented animal abuse, particularly of elephants, something Ms. Gruen never refers to in her novel--although, to her credit, she talks about the infamous, unbelievably cruel execution of Topsy by electrocution of none other than American paragon Thomas Edison.  It's also quite unrealistic that they would be able to keep an adult chimp as a pet, especially with five children of their own to care for and protect.  Chimps become quite intractable as adults; they're extremely strong, unpredictable and dangerous.I can't help thinking that the happy ending to a circus novel set in the 21st century would have Rosie sent to a place like The Elephant Sanctuary to spend her remaining life blissfully roaming hundreds of acres with other former circus and zoo elephants, and Bobo retiring to a wonderful sanctuary like Save the Chimps, where he would join a chimp family and have the closest thing to a normal life a captive ape can have.  And Jacob getting a job at a zoo so he can take Rosie along after his circus career is also not a very cheery outcome for me.  There's no question that zoo elephants lead short, painful, highly restricted lives, and many zoos are in the process of retiring their elephants to sanctuaries.Also, it's quite unbelievable to me that after Jacob witnessed so much brutality while working for circuses earlier in his life, he would want to join a circus again rather than live in a nursing home.  That speaks volumes about that nursing home!Lastly, I understand that the author considers herself an animal lover, but that can mean a lot of things, and I'm wondering exactly what her agenda was, writing this book.",0
"If you are new to this series, a word of advice, read the first three and stop. That is where the story really ends, after that the genius dies, the author is hopelessly lot in the morass, and the readers and characters all get sucked down with him.After the first three books,everyone gradually develops a collective amnesia. They forget their own characters along with just about everything else that ever made them real or interesting. At some point in their past, they may have been motivated to seek a goal, but what it was, why they wanted it, how they were going to attain it, that has all long been lost. Instead they now wander around forever in their own little circles, bogging further and further down with each step. Probably their weariness came from having to endure hearing the entire life story and food preferences of every bit player they encounter in the story. No wait, that was me!I feel so sad writing this, because I absolutely loved George Martin's writing when i first discovered him, the ""Aces"" series, Fevre Dream, the first three books in the ""Thrones"", i devoured them and counted the days when there would be more. When ""Feast"" turned out to be rubbish, I thought it an aberration, I was more than ready to forgive. I believed his explanation, he had so much to say that it was hard to move it all forward. Now that I have read ""Dance"", I see it is actually the opposite, he has so little to say that he is compelled to add story after story and worthless detail after worthless detail in a vain attempt to find him way back. But with ""Dance"" I have to conclude, he is lost, the characters are lost and reading more is just trampling on their corpses.I wanted to settle in for a good long read, to savour each line and lose myself in his world, but 1000 pages of nothing was not worth the time lost out of my life. There was one momentary flash of the old storyteller, the section describing the greenseers brought hope back for a moment, but it was not to be, maybe someone else wrote that part for him. Quickly following were jarring contemporary references and constant resorts to laughably vulgar writing. This book is nowhere near Tolkien's league,  Harold Robbins and Sidney Sheldon, though, now that is the right company.",0
"With all the positive ratings I had high hopes for this book. But, alas, I couldn't help wondering what all the fuss was about. I found the story fairly boring and eventually couldn't wait to be done with it. It's another romance, set in a circus. The characters were not that appealing and the book could probably have been condensed to half the verbage. Suffice it to say I didn't like it.",0
".. to keep reading this book.  I am not even a 1/3 of the way in and feel like I'm walking in quicksand and the further I go the more I sink and all I can feel is the terror of drowning so slowly and boringly that people will just stand and laugh at me.  I may be able to pick this back up later .. maybe.  I realy feel that this book (even more so than one of the others, which I can't remember at this point as my mind is filled with sludge minutae) was drawn out purposely.  Don't keep dragging things out, man.  Give the story some peace and end if it you need to and move onto another project.  That slow, agonizing, dying death sound is me suffering through the pages.",0
I'm just not the type to enjoy this sort of storyline.  This was my fault for taking a flyer on something that was in the movies (which I never saw) and wanted to skip Hollywood for the story directly.  Couldn't finish it -- not for me.  But saved me from seeing the screenplay).,0
I love a good strong cup of tea...not to mention a buttery scone.  The recipes in this book are too fancy and time consuming for me ...and most of the ingredients are difficult to find.

"I cannot understand how 99 people can give this book 4 or 5 stars???  I couldn't even get past the first chapter as this was utterly UNBELIEVABLE even for a fantasy book.We have the 'reclusive genius', Lorenzo Marcus, making a rare speaking engagement at a college.  Marcus and his sidekick, Matt(who aren't who they appear to be, but more on that later.) set their sites on Kim Ford who they need for some 'mission'.  They, also, just happen to need four other people for their team and VOILA! Kim just happens to be accompanied by four other people.  How convenient.After the speaking engagement, Kim and her cronies wisk Mr Marcus and Matt away from the throng of admirers to go back to Mr Marcus's hotel.  But wait!  They are being followed and Paul (one of the five) is suspicious.  I guess he never gave it a thought that they just might be followed by one of Mr Marcus's admirers from the college?At the hotel, Paul calls them out and says, You aren't Lorenzo Marcus, are you?'  To which Mr Marcus confesses that his real name is Loren, but his friends call him 'Silvercloak', Matt was a King of the Dwarves and they come from a place called Paras Derval,in another world, where Ailell reigns.  Yeah, right??  I CERTAINLY would believe this guy that I have never met!!!DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS TRIPE!!!",0
"I've been enjoying the Flashman series from my local library, and was looking forwards to the Kindle edition. But 12.99 is just too expensive to make it worthwhile. I'd pay 5.99, but not more. Also, has Kindle figured out how to implement the Notes feature such that it's easy to use? For the print books the notes are key to connecting the fiction and the fact, and you have to be able to easily jump back and forth. Earlier Kindle books weren't too good at this, and I hope that this has been addressed in this series.",0
"The superman character goes from one locale to another, saving protitutes and Vietnam war prisoners, in a highly contrived plot that seems addressed to mid-level military people and low level boat people. Really not for the highly educated.",0
"The first three books had a plot and just a few point of view characters. Now it is a meandering mess with too many pov's and not plot with beginning/middle/end. I enjoyed this book, but what started as a great series at the pantheon of fantasy fiction is now simply enjoyable.",0
"I remember finishing ""Storm of Swords"" like some people remember the Kennedy assassination.I know exactly where I was and how loud I screamed, and I couldn't wait to read the next book. The wait felt agonizing, and I practically kicked down the door of my local bookstore when ""A Feast for Crows"" hit the shelves. Within four pages I was engrossed, but thought Martin's decision to split the narrative was a rotten one, and couldn't believe that no one was able to stop him. Perhaps his publishers were so eager to see the next book in print they didn't care that Martin was suddenly writing like a rambling old man tanked on tranquilizers. After years of waiting I kinda gave up on the prospect of the final book ever becoming my mind candy, but when I spotted it at the bookstore I couldn't resist. Sixty pages deep I was bored out of my mind, and started skimming and skipping chapters - which resulted in missing absolutely nothing. Instead of ""A Dance with Dragons"" this book should be called ""A Wish for Washy"" since page after page is dedicated to meandering conversations between suddenly flummoxed characters incapable of toddler-level decision making. I can't believe how bloated this book is with meaningless, empty interactions between characters Martin has clearly forgotten as much as I had. Instead of rooting for my favorite characters I found myself hoping one would stumble upon blueprints for the sort of advanced weaponry that would wipe out the entire cast in a single swoop, and spare the world any further sequels.",0
"I feel really bad saying this, because the poor woman was 81 and had Alzheimer's when she wrote it, but this book is horrible. No plot development, no mystery, tedious and predictable. I didn't read any of the reviews before I bought it because I was afraid of spoilers, and because as a die hard fan I had trust in Christie's work. But I had no idea this was her final book, or that her mind was so far gone by the time she wrote it. I feel bad for her. She is truly a classic, and one of my favorite writers of all time. But I really wish I had skipped this one, and I recommend you do too.",0
"Today there are still jokes about how Anne Boleyn lost her head, but life as a wife of Henry VIII was no laughing matter. In The Other Boleyn Girl, Philippa Gregory gives a fictional account of Henry's most famous queen from the perspective of her sister, Mary. Gregory tries to capture a sisterly dynamic understandable to contemporary readers. Anne and Mary are opposites in appearance and temperament; loyal to one another out of obligation, not love; and, we are told, lifelong rivals. Oddly, that rivalry never quite materializes here other than in spiteful and venomous words and feelings. While Anne seethes with ambition and resentment, Mary is too passive a personality to be a match for Anne, nor does she try to be. As portrayed, the conflict between the sisters is more petty than powerful.Gregory's choice for Mary to serve as narrator, as though it were her memoir, detracts from the sense of history. A Tudor-era aristocrat like Mary does not seem likely to set her story down in such detail after the events have passed. It might have been more effective to frame the story as a researcher's discovery of Mary's journals and letters. When handled adroitly, this type of framing device can make the characters and story more immediate and less obviously fictional. Another alternative would have been the omniscient third person, which might have been more convincing. As it is, I could not suspend my disbelief in Mary's voice, with its anachronistic nuances and sensibilities. She sounds more like a modern author than a 16th-century woman remembering the recent and difficult past.Therein lies another problem--Mary never explains why she wrote all of this down, why she delves into such detail, or who she expects the reader to be. It might have made more sense if she had said she wanted her legacy to be the true story of her and her family's role in Anne's rise and fall, that she wanted her own name to be remembered, or that she was writing for her children and Anne's daughter, the Princess Elizabeth. We never know her purpose, which is strange because we learn from her that the Boleyn family does nothing without a reason. Given how poorly Mary's memories reflect on all the Boleyns and Howards, including herself, it become even more of a mystery why Gregory chose this format.The Other Boleyn Girl draws readers in the same way that 1980s night-time dramas drew in viewers. Never particular about morals and influenced by time and events, Anne becomes as ruthless and desperate for power as any soap villainess, with her family's encouragement and support. Mary, once favored by king and family, is tossed aside when she proves to lack the will and desire to usurp the queen's place. She chooses her own path, never losing sight of her rivalry with Anne and never envious of Anne's sacrifices and sufferings.Historical inaccuracies aside, including details about Mary and her children, Gregory fails to capture the larger world in which the Boleyn drama was enacted. She refers to France and Spain and their rulers, and the pope, but the complexity of the world outside Henry VIII's court and its politics is relegated to the background, brought forward in snippets only as needed. Henry himself is portrayed as hunting, gaming, and dancing from morning until night, with only an occasional concern for the kingdom's business or for the intrigues of his enemies and allies. The world here seems narrow and confined because it is only the world Mary sees--Mary, the other Boleyn girl who pretends to remain naive and who tries to focus on her own life, only to be drawn again and again into Anne's drama.Gregory tries to use the story of the Boleyn girls to illustrate women's issues during the 16th century. As Mary notes, women are only pawns in the marriage game, played to achieve position, power, and wealth. It's clear, however, that men who lack power are pawns as well; George Boleyn and Henry Percy are forced into miserable marriages. The lesson here is less about the vulnerability of women to the whims of men than about how people of both gender were played for power.Despite Gregory's comments about the charges against the Boleyns, found in the book's end matter, Mary witnesses (and, significantly, remembers in detail) enough clues to know whether Anne and George were guilty of the crimes for which they were beheaded. This is disappointing, because Gregory's hints, if not her stance of ambiguity, ignore the logic and the politics behind the charges.Even at the end, Gregory misses an opportunity. Mary does not hear Anne's last words and does not include them in her work. This makes no sense, as they were recorded and can be read today. Gregory fails to weave in the available documented details that would have added real-life drama and interest to the story. Why would Mary not reflect on the final message of ""the other Boleyn girl,"" given her inside knowledge of Anne and her willingness to write about her and the other Boleyns?With its compelling historical setting, The Other Boleyn Girl had the potential to be an engaging if inadequate and flawed historical fiction. Don't rely on it, as I have heard some do, for your knowledge and understanding of Henry VIII, his court, or the Boleyns.",0
"Required no thinking. Boring and trite. I can't imagine why this book is so popular. (In fact, I read it a few years ago but it popped up here and I wanted to review it now to give another point of view to the multitudes who adored it.)",0
"I loved Debt of Honor and wanted to read this as it was the sequel.  Too bad.  It never lived up to Debt of Honor.  I tried 3-4 times (over about 2 years) to get past the first 100 pages, which were painfully slow.  I kept reading mostly based on the good Amazon reviews.  The book ultimately picked up the pace and became more interesting, but it was just too predictable and lacked much novelty.  At times it was dreadful slow and detailed.  Overall, I can think of numerous other books that are far better than this one.",0
"I hate these books as much as I love them.  They go on and on and say nothing  An interesting, well loved character to me equals great reading, a character I don't like means pushing my way through many tedious pages of boredom.  Martin is an OK writer but if he was a good writer the books could be half as long and say much more.  I don't understand why people think these books are great as they are simply tedious and at times very boring.  Don't waste your time trying to read this sluggish mess of words",0
"I hesitate to slap a derisive label like ""chick lit"" on anything, but author Sara Gruen's third novel is a prime example of the worst kind of ""women's fiction""; Water for Elephants was obviously written by a woman solely for other women, with no attempt to be realistic from the male point of view. Instead it perpetuates the romantic ideals set forth by Harlequin and its ilk -- heights that no three-dimensional male can ever reach. (No wonder it was a word-of-mouth bestseller.)This is shown most strikingly through Gruen's protagonist, Jacob Jankowski. He does not talk, think, or act like any (straight) man I have ever met. The purpose he serves, it seems, is to stand in for a lot of women's idea of what a man should be. When a man looks at another man and calls him ""unshaven"" with the implication that what he really means is ""unclean,"" you know you're nowhere near reality. This type of man lives only in fiction.Gruen even makes Jacob a virgin (though old enough to have a degree from veterinary school) so that when he and the female lead finally make it to the bed (which is inevitable in this world), it more closely match the unspoken wishes of her audience.(Now, understand, men's fiction is no better from the woman's point of view, with the hero more often than not bedding the female lead, who then conveniently dies so he can have access to a series of new women without guilt for the expense of a succession of prostitutes. I'm not saying it's any better, but at least it's marketed to men and not a general audience.)Gruen relies so much on stereotypes from romance novels (or even just their covers) and ""chick flicks"" that none of the characters in Water for Elephants ever feels like a real human being but simply an archetype playing its part in her story. The writing flows nicely, and the story is somewhat interesting if you don't mind melodrama.Also, Gruen manages to humanize people who have previously been seen as freaks, but this was all for nought when I never believed that the narrator was telling me the truth about his gender. I actually kept waiting for that to be a ""twist"" in the story, and in fact was disappointed when it never came.Plus, if a man were really telling the story, he would undoubtedly have recognized the sophomoric unintentional hilarity in the following passage: Teams of men are ... raising enormous poles.... I pass a group of ten throwing their combined weight against a single rope as a man off to the side chants, ""Pull it, shake it, break it! Again--pull it, shake it, break it! Now downstake it!"" [p. 34].(Yeah, that's what she said!)",0
"I have never done this before this book, but I have skipped large numbers of pages looking for a story.  All I read are inane details, like George R.R. Martin just likes the sound of his own voice, or the appearance of his own writing I should say.  The fact that it has taken two separate books in order to address all of the characters over a fairly short period of time where almost nothing happens means that Martin needs a new editor at the least.  Someone needs to cut his books in half or more.  Someone needs to cut away the unnecessary description, because it isn't like his descriptions are poetic or great literature.  I give up.  I have tried and tried to get through the last three Martin books in this series, but I give up.  I am not going to waste any more time.",0
"i don't know why this section is needed,,,, i think that just hitting the stars would be good enough for a review... who has time to write all this",0
"""Sahara"" was one of the more disappointing Dirk Pitt novels I've read.  It follows the usual Cussler mold: some secret historical event or treasure forms the background of the novel, Pitt saves the life of a beautiful woman and then helps her with some unrelated problem that threatens the world, Pitt ends up finding the treasure/secret historical event, Pitt makes love to the woman and everything turns out great.This book follows that pattern, but it's missing a lot of the flare and excitement that I usually find in novels.  I didn't find Pitt's love interest very appealing in this story, and there didn't seem much of a connection.  It was more of a ""well, there's a beautiful girl lying on the beach, I guess I'll make her my love interest for this story.""  The story was pretty bland as well.  The title centers around Pitt being trapped in the Sahara desert with his sidekick, Al Giordino and being chased by a generic ruthless dictator.  I found the location really boring, and there didn't seem to be anything in this story I couldn't find from any B action movie on cable late at night.  Lastly, I was really disappointed with the ""historical twist.""  Usually this is one of the great things about a Dirk Pitt novel, but this one was really far-fetched and cheesy, and didn't invoke any excitement from me.""Sahara"" can be looked on as a ""filler chapter"" in an otherwise great book (The Dirk Pitt series).  There is no character development and you will miss nothing by skipping over this book and going to the next in the series.  I wouldn't call it a bad book at all, just pretty boring and not up to the usual level of excitement I've come to expect from Clive Cussler.",0
"2000 readers can't be wrong can they?  Umm, yea they might be.How is it that a mediocre book can consistently get raves?I was excited by the ""prospect"" of this book but the more I read, the more resigned I became to the fact that there was nothing very extraordinary about it.Not only is the writing flat and the plot a giant cliche - there's also the matter of the central ""love"" triangle being blatantly lifted from Sophie's Choice (I cringe referring to that classic alongside this book) right down to the suprise party / angry accusation by a lunatic.Mediocrity is being rewarded with a big Hollywood movie starring Reese Witherspoon.  Ahh, American pop culture.",0
"I thought this book would be outstanding by all the really good reviews it got. But I only read about 3 1/2 chapters and called it quits. I just thought it was very dull reading. I thought perhaps, I would try again at some point to read it..but after thinking about that idea for a while--I decided that I wouldn't try reading it again. I will say I was disappointed; I will also say I would not suggest to anyone to read this book.  :(",0
"After all the outstanding reviews of Powell's work, I decided to see what I was missing. Well, after reading the first installment of this 12-volume epic, I'm left with two questions:1. How did this man ever get this first novelette published?2. Why should anyone care to read beyond it?I encountered perhaps one quiet moment of smiling in this dull novel where nothing ever happens, and a lot of the world-weariness of the English upper classes, where the smallest details of home, dress, speech, gesture, action (not that there's much of it) are judged wanting by one or another of the characters. It's always about class and prejudice. Sigh. The author provides no reason for the reader to care about any of his characters.The introductory paragraphs promise great things, with a solemn nod to the muses, and occasional epic tags occur with libations and ritual movements, but it's all a tidy bag of nothing. Rather like Graham Greene, but without the nastiness. Henry James does this kind of thing well while engaging the interest and emotions of his reader; Powell could have learned from him.The next time I want to read about the English upper classes leading lives of silent desperation cloaked in ennui, I shall turn to P.G. Wodehouse, God bless him.",0
"Having read a great deal of Agatha Christie,  this has to be my least favorite so far.  It is a very ""psychological"" novel.  I thought it was slow and uninteresting, and I did no feel the ending was well done.  I had to really drag myself through this.",0
"Let me start by saying I love Agathie Christie, she's one of my guilty pleasures. There's nothing cosier that sitting in a lovely warm living room reading an Christie novel while it's raining outside.That being said, this novel is very odd and uninspiring. It's not one of her typical murder mysteries...and it's all very farfetched and just barely comes together in the end.Fans of her usual material might seem a bit baffled by this 'novel'. This probably would have made a fine screenplay...but there's not enough coherence or guts to it, to make it a good novel as such. The characters also, are rather forgettable. The climax to the novel as well, is all rather odd and unimpressive.A fast read notheless.",0
"Seriously.  I find myself skimming over the chapters to 'get to the good parts'.  That tells me I'm bored, and after waiting for this book for so long, it's simply no longer entertaining.  Dani is a waste of time, and I had such high expectations of her.  Tyrion has become the fool he so desparately isn't, and I don't give a crap about all the minor houses that seem to take up a great chunk of the pages and the story.  Jon has been the only saving grace, but I'm afraid even that's wearing thin.  This book is so sadly disappointing.  Like a party you've looked forward to for weeks and weeks, and it turns out to be a big blah.ADDED Aug 1st.  SPOILER:  REALLY?!?!?!  Jon is dead?  WTF?  Couldn't you have killed off Dani?  Cersi?  But JON?!?! Was this bastard so like his father, that it was his honor and steadfast hold on doing what's right that got him killed too?  Aaarrrggggghhhh!",0

"While the three books that form the &quot;Fionavar Tapestry&quot; are engaging, they all suffer, to varying degrees, from a loosely scripted, and at times, implausible plot, as well as the inclusion of Arthurian elements  that remain contrived and unnecessary except as a &quot;hook&quot;  pandering to the appeal the Camelot legend holds for many readers, and that  has already elsewhere been overworked.  Further, I question the plot  device of characters that are transported by varying means from  &quot;our&quot; world into parallel fantasy realms that appear popular with  many fantasy writers: Effectively used to inform the story in Donaldson's  &quot;Covenant&quot; series, other writers turn to its use solely as a  clever artifice by which to move characters around.Though better than  most of the fantasy fiction about, this trilogy lacks the focus of Kay's  later, more mature and individual works, such as &quot;Tigana&quot; or  &quot;Song for Arbonne.&quot;  Read these if you are seeking serious and  original fantasy tales.  Save the &quot;Fionavar Trilogy&quot; for moments  of simple, unexamined diversion.(As &quot;The Summer Tree&quot; is the  weakest book in the trilogy, I have only rated it individually two stars,  whereas I have rated the series three stars overall in my review of  &quot;The Darkest Road.&quot;)",0

"It is possibly unfair of me to review this book before finishing it, though I don't believe my chief complaint -- the atrocious writing -- would change, in any case. I'm also not sure I'll be able to finish it, because Gregory's prose is like nails on a blackboard: repetitious, unoriginal, shallow, and riddled with trite phrasing. So if you're looking for good literature, don't look here. On the other hand, if you're looking for a good story and can stomach the awful writing, the boring tendency to list things instead of actually describing them in some depth, and the repetition, give it a try. It needs some tightening and a good editorial hand, but alas . . . I don't generally care for historical fiction and perhaps this is just the way it's done (tho' one need only read EL Doctorow's ""Ragtime"" to get an idea of what a truly good writer can do with history and fiction), but I found myself cringing at the superficial, tedious writing style and rolling my eyes at the ""Harlequin Romance""-style prose: ""I laughed wrecklessly"" . . . ""He did not take his eyes off of me"" (about 10 billion times) . . . ""He cupped my chin in his hand"" . . . (etc.). Gag.",0

"This is going to be one short review!: Stay away! unless you like glacial pacing, endless description, and in-depth character sketches.When I first turned to Page One and started, I first thought to myself, ""Hey, this guy can write!"" I was truly surprised and delighted to at last find a writer who really knows how to turn a sentence and a paragraph.Then I continued into Chapter Two and I began to notice things, such as the gathering aimlessness of the story. Sure, the quality of the prose never sagged, and I was still happy to find that. But I became slowly overcome by drowsiness as it became more and more evident that this guy just doesn't have a story to tell. Even in the places where things -- events -- actually do take place, they are related in bland undramatic fashion. I distinctly remember after a long afternoon on a day off from work, as my eyelids were drooping ever lower, perking up for about a second when I got to the part where the Earth Transnat spacecraft was approaching Mars to intervene in the Rebellion. Boy! I first thought -- something exciting just might begin happening! Boy was I disappointed when the scene just fizzled without any conflict.I should have learned my lesson and put the book aside right then and there. But I slogged on all the way to the end, truly hoping it would get better. Sadly, it never did. I even went on the Blue Mars. Out of luck yet again.If you like Crichton, you will hate Hate HATE Robinson! This book is the polar opposite of the excellent Airframe, Prey, and Jurassic Park. Robinson does at first sight appear to offer interesting material and themes, but his style of execution is just plain bland. If Crichton's fare is thought of as a breakfast in an expensive restaurant of French toast -- crispy at the edges and velvety in the middle, sprinkled with cinnamon, with REAL Maple syrup and butter, with strawberries and sausage on the side -- then Robinson's fare is like a plain bowl of oatmeal made with water, not milk. Mmmmm...steamy, visible texture, slight nutty taste...but after a few spoonfuls...yuck!...this is all there is??Ironic that the Wikipedia entry for the Mars Trilogy is so much more interesting than the book itself! (or then again, perhaps not when considered retrospectively)Yes, I see on the Wiki that things DO after all happen in the books, BUT THERE IS NO PLOTTING, which is to say, events do not lead inexorably from one to the next, as they must in any fictional work of quality. Events do not build one upon the other; these books are essentially episodic with extensive expanses of physical description and endless character sketches.Save yourself alot of time and just look through the Wikipedia entry, or get yourself a copy from a friend who has gone through and highlighted the few interesting passages so you can skip over all the drivel. If you really must torture yourself and read it all yourself, bring a big box of No Doze or some other such stimulant.",0

"...that 155 people rated this as 5 star. I agree with every 1 and 2 star review: BORRRR-iiing. I have been reading for 50 years and only never finished 1 book. Now, 2. I hate this author's style of writing: pages of technobabble with scientific formulas that neither make sense to the lay reader, nor serve a purpose, followed by such minute details of irrelevant,stupid things like the page long description of the contents of a tool box. Then, there is the overuse and abuse of the word ""and"". The author must never have heard of the use of commas. All of the endless descriptions of the Martian surface being flat and dusty with the scattered rocks really helps my insomnia though. I only made it to Chapter 11, so I guess I never got far enough for all the political hoorah other reviewers referenced. I just didn't get it. I was hoping for a great story about colonizing a new world. What I got was the second worst book I have ever tried to read. I'm glad I didn't pay for this.",0

I want them to evolve, grow up, turn evil, go mad, save the world, destroy the world...anything! I could give two figs about the hundreds of new, irrelevant, window-dressing characters that were introduced in 4 and 5: One-Eyed This, One-Armed That, the Giant, the Forked Beard, Green Grace, Blue Grace, Kindly Man. It's exhausting. If there's a prize for 'Most Useless Characters in a Single Novel', Martin wins.The power house families have crumbled but rather than rebuild them (Lady Catelyn appears only briefly in Book 4 despite her character's fantastic potential for vengeance and villainry!!) Martin has thrown us bones like Ramsay and Daario, hoping that we will keep gnawing.Seriously, I love George Martin's writing and he tells a wonderful story but I'm not sure I can endure a Number 6. Maybe we're all better off watching where HBO takes the story.",0

When I read a novel based on a television series, I want to see a story that puts the characters in situations that we can't see on the tube, be it for budget considerations, mature story content, or whatever.

This book was one of the most uninteresting books that I have ever read.  I am not a fantasy book reader but I saw the reviews so I thought I would give this book a try.  I really thought that there were way too many characters in this book.I will admit that it was really helpful that the author did put together a listing of who is who.

"I waited eleven years for some of these characters, between A Storm of Swords and this novel, after the horrific mistake of removing half of the character stories from A Feast for Crows. Although I don't think that Crows was as bad as the average fan says, it suffered from pacing issues and having too few characters on which to focus. I would imagine even George recognizes now what an insipid idea it was to change the format of the series, mid way through. That isn't done for a reason, and we saw why; it didn't work, and the fans hated it.So fast forward to the long awaited Dance with Dragons. GRRM spent a third of the book trying to rush us up to speed. The book required a brief intro from GRRM attempting to explain the format. Again, why was the split ever made?Dragons was rubbish. I mean, garbage. From the overuse of certain words (poor editing), to the incessant pointlessness of whole story lines (again, where is the editor?), to the destroying of Tyrion as the series's most interesting character (I didn't think that possible), down to the cesspool that is Daenerys' chapters. Why does she even exist any more?I'm also not sure why Sansa, Brienne and Samwell weren't in this book, and yet Quentyn Martell had endless pages of nothingness devoted to his vapid existence. We follow his painfully dull journey from one continent to the other.. and he dies. And the world is impacted in no way. Again, what was the point? His existence did not move the story forward one bit. And what was with the endless torture of Theon, turning him into a disgusting, deformed creature that we feel empathy for? An odd turn I thought. But far less objectionable than much of the rest of the book.I think the first three books in the series were brilliant. The fourth is slower, yes, but perhaps the best written. The war had ended, and many fans were expecting more action, but it's an examination of the hell that wars creates. It's a thoughtful piece, and I've read it twice, enjoying it both times.Dance? Dance is just horrid. I struggled to finish it, and will never go near it again. Eleven years is a long time for any author, and GRRM clearly is having difficulty keeping everything together. By his own admission, the series was only supposed to be three novels, and this world that he created twenty years ago is now far larger and more unwieldy than he ever intended.And it shows.",0

There are many rocks and foreigners who behave like rocks: ""Dune"" on Mars this is not.Characters there are in plenty but must we endure their every identical step taken across Mars? A long journey into the heart of a geological dictionary does not make for great Science Fiction.

"I have to preface by saying I loved book 1 but have been increasingly disappointed with subsequent novels. (OK maybe book 3 was reasonable). It is sad to see a series where each book is about half as good as the one before it. Martin needs an editor with an iron fist. This book makes watching grass grow exciting. Really, why take every character that you have built over many books and either degrade them, make them unpleasant and unlikable, or just slit their throat. And while you are at it, throw in some brand new characters who meander around contributing nothing to the overarching storyline.I so enjoyed the first book. I survived the death of so many main characters in the next few books. But now, I just can't be bothered anymore. The whole series should have stayed a trilogy. I can't make the effort to wade through chapters of nothing to get the odd tidbit of plot progression.Can someone tell me after they finish the series if anyone worth caring for survives? Do the dragons come and melt the icy bad guys? Does Tyrion get to be King? Do I really care?",0

I guess, for me, it just left a whole lot to be desired.The main characters were very one-dimensional.  In fact, ALL of the characters were one-dimensional and needed a lot of development.I can't say I'd never read another Pyper book again but I can say I'm not rushing out to see if there are any more.",0

This is only a book for a person without common sense advising how to live within a normal day without killing or maiming yourself with your own stupidity. The best information was the section on first aid. However, if you ever took a babysitting course or did any sort of boy scouts or girl scouts, you already know more than what is in this book.",0
"I was really looking forward to reading this book, especially after seeing the previews for the upcoming movie.  I must say that it is one of the worst books I have ever read and I have been an avid reader my entire life.  I couldn't relate or get attached to the main character, Jacob, except at certain points when he was elderly.  I actually felt very embarrassed for the author while reading the many squalor erotica scenes that did nothing to help me connect or care for any of the characters.  I was expecting a heartfelt romance, but the characters, including the love interest, Marlena, are so one dimensional that I found the whole thing absurd and unbelievable.  I kept trying to get into it and hoped it would get better as it went along, but no such luck.  If you must read it, try to borrow it instead of buying or see if you can pick up a cheap copy at a thrift store.  Better yet, spend your time reading something with a convincing story and engaging characters instead.",0

The plot sounded amazing to me when I first read it on the website, but once I started reading it I discovered that it was poorly explained and executed.Adam meets a young girl one day who he becomes friends with even though she lives in an odd gypsy village in the Scottish hills, while he is the son of a minister. They soon become lovers, but Adam moves on to be a doctor and when Brid, fearing for her life because her uncle the druid wants to kill her is rejected by Adam she swears to become the main focus in his life. Of course, it turns out Brid is really from the 6th century and has great powers that allow her to cross time.The way Brid became accommodated to life in the 20th century is just stupid. No person from the 6th century who saw a car would be able to hold it together, much less eat chocolate without a huge sense of wonder.Brid's situation as a person who can travel through time, change into a cat, leave her body at will, and do all sorts of other stuff is never portrayed as anything out of the ordinary, and as much as she does make Adam's life miserable, the actions people around Adam take to be safe from her are just plain silly. Also it's never clear if Brid really is in the 20th century, or just having an out of time out of body experience from the 6th century. Or both.  Not much in this book makes sense, and the very end of the book is so out of place in the book it renders the whole ending stupid.This is not one of Barbara Erskine's better books, and I recommend skipping this one. It has the feel of a draft written very early on that was never revised for anything except spelling. This book doesn't even seem to fit a category, be it historical fiction or thriller. If you want a real good historical book about time travel try the Outlander series by Diana Gabaldon, or Doomsday Book by Connie Willis.I hate to say it, but this only gets two stars from me.",0
"Pearce begins his book pompously: ""I am convinced that [this book] penetrates to the very core of its subject.""  Yet, rather than provide insight into Wilde as Pearce claims, the book is only the Reader's Digest version of Ellmann's biography.  If you are short on time and want an overview of Wilde's life and work, you could do worse.  Just don't expect perceptive analysis.",0
"I am not sure if Martin has simply lost interest in this project, has become distracted, or simply been overwhelmed...Or if editors have helped or hindered him. Though, I think it is telling that one of his editors admits he's left a book's worth of material on the cutting room floor.The book somehow manages to feel both too meandering and too rushed at the same time. And I can't help but feel that some of his experience in writing scripts for the HBO series has rubbed off on how he writes the books. In fact, I'm certain of it.If so, we're all the poorer for it.I can't imagine events being wrapped up in two books, given what he chose to spend so much time on in this one...and we'll have to wait ten years to find out.Martin was probably a bit too cruelly gratuitous in his cliffhangers. Reading this book might be a much different experience as part of a completed series, but taken alone, is painful, and not as re-readable as the first 3 books.",0
"REVIEW: Not exactly the best book to start with if you're curious about Christie; and her expertly crafted, wildly plotted crime novels. Still, ""ELEPHANTS CAN REMEMBER"" does have its charms and its moments of glory. The story concerns the murder/suicide of General Ravenscroft and his wife Margaret on a lonely cliffside at their house in Cornwall some twenty-odd years before the book's opening scene. Famed mystery novelist Ariadne Oliver (Christie's alter-ego) is approached at a literary luncheon by the overbearing presence of a Mrs. Burton-Cox who wants her to find out the truth behind the tragedy as it involves Mrs. Oliver's goddaughter, Celia Ravenscroft, who just so happens to be engaged to Mrs. Burton-Cox's son, Desmond. The reason why she wants the whole affair dug up is puzzling to Mrs. Oliver, and so she pays a visit to her old friend M. Hercule Poirot who (though at first reluctant) decides to help Ariadne uncover the truth about the deaths. The solution to the killings is sound (if trite), yet no where near as intriguing as Christie's other ""murder in retrospect"" cases. On top of that: the book rambles on too much and is too leisurely paced for a lengthy novel (as a short story it might have had more success). Still it's hard to dismiss ""ELEPHANTS"" as an all-out failure. It is flawed yet engaging, and the sheer joy of reading along with such wonderful characters as Ariadne and Poirot makes it all worthwhile. Alas, there is an excuse for Dame Agatha's slightly below par performance: after all the woman was eight-two-years-old and in diminishing health when the book was written.",0
"I found it difficult to finish this book because I didn't care about most of the characters. I enjoyed the Arya and Jon segments, but the others rarely held my interest.  I have fond memories of reading the earlier books, but that thrill was largely absent here.",0
This is pretty cheesy and salacious.  Not worth spending the time.  I gave up after a half-dozen chapters.  Its not so much a science fiction novel as it is about exploitation of females.  Don't waste your time.,0
"The companion to book 4, terrible in my opinion.  Too much focus on outside characters and lack of knowledge of the main characters. Also, huge let down in the end. I honestly don't think I'll bother with the rest of the books.",0
"I just finished this book and I must ay that it was a spectacularly boring  collection inane sentences.It starts off ambitiously enough, written in  a general and uniquely abstract style, it lets you know from the get go  that its first-person, narrator-unreliable. Good enough, always nice to see  new forms of writing in the field. Then, however, it plummets.Like many  inept Brit science fiction writers, the author attempts to turn everyday  optical illusions and quirky perceptions into witty existential-scientific  theories, and abstract social theories into reality, without any  interpretation. I guess because Douglas Adams pulled it off in Hitchhiker's  guide, book editors now let any hack from across the pond try it.  Unfortunately, as is usual, it failed. Instead of thgought provoking,  amusing prose on things we never think about, we are weighed down with  boring chaotic nonsense. Only Forward shows all the brilliance of a  shorted-out low watt bulb, covered in mud.The plot is choppy and lacks  any coherent purpose, the characters are dull, one dimensional, and devoid  of interest.  In this reader's opinion: the description on the back of the  book is a heck of a lot more interesting than the book itself. Maybe next  time the author will try writing that instead of the disjointed nonsense he  slopped inside.",0
"I bought this book based on the recommendations from amazon.  I found the book difficult to get through until the last 100 pages.  The story is slow and simply tedious.  I had to force myself through it. The end of the story, about 200-250 pages in, it picks up a bit and becomes more fast paced and readable.",0
"Really? Others here have summed up my sentiments in fabulous detail so I will just say, if you just have to read more of this story, you'll enjoy the book. If you are looking for resolution, completion or the storyline to pick up....well that isn't going to happen. I just don't need a list of 200 characters that mean nothing to me nor do I want to keep jumping around the countryside without an end game. Story lines are too broken, seem to be forgotten or lost and serously I am too!I feel a little ripped off...like I got pulled into an amazing series, and then the author decided to just keep writing but forgot where he was going, or that there needs to be an ending soon. But by now all the characters worth following are dead,absent,or just doing strange unrelated things.Wake me when it's over which I guess will be in another 5 years from now. Oh hummmm.",0
"Not my kind of story;  read a few chapters after recommendation by a friend,  but never could get into it!",0
"I picked up this book after being inspired by some quotes from Kahlil Gibran. This is a brief text written in a flowery language that masks some simple points. I did not find this book inspiring or insightful, but it was a short read.",0
"I found this book, which takes place during the Spanish Civil War, interesting in its descriptions and although it is excruciatingly slow in its development (five hundred pages detailing three days worth of events), somewhat compelling in its own way.And yet in the end, ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" is ultimately a novel with a fatalistic outlook and few, if any, redeeming messages for humanity, in spite of all the commentaries it makes about human nature. To me, the story was the most interesting as a reflection of Hemingway's own experiences and strange outlooks on life.For example, one would assume that Robert Jordan, the main character, is a reflection of what Hemingway deems heroic. Like Hemingway, Jordan is a rugged, somewhat independent sort. Jordan characterizes the literary period's allure for the expatriate life and Hemingway's fascination with Spain and dislike for the Spanish Fascist. But yet, one has to wonder what compels Jordan, an American college professor from Montana, to be involved in this Spanish Civil War to the extent that he has become a demolitions expert and is ready to kill Spaniards (regardless of what side they happen to have fallen upon) without any conscience. What busness, really and truly, is this war of his?Further, how do you root for a hero, who is fighting for, and willing to give his life while following orders from, Communists that Hemingway makes clear are every bit as brutal as the Fascists?Notable is the fact that the Jordan character feels shame for a father who committed suicide, just as Hemingway's own father did. And for Hemingway to commit suicide 20 years after this book was written parallels the sense of inevitable doom that is a pervasive theme of this story.This book demonstrates that Hemingway had a way with descriptions and dialogue that can be at times entertaining and at other times irritating. For example, his conventions for speech that is a more literal reflection of the Spanish language is rather clever. However, as the story progresses, Hemingway's usage of the King James-style ""Thee"" and ""Thou"" to indicate that a more formal Spanish dialect is being used becomes distractingly gimmicky and wore quite thin by the end of the book. At least, it did for me.This is a story about people who are flawed to the extent that they will kill without hesitation...people who have abandoned God and Godly virtues, and look to themselves for their own salvation. What little is left is a cause whose means and ends don't seem to differ from the alternative, and an appeal to virtues of loyalty to the band, or one's responsibility to follow his duty. The trouble is, these appeals are made among characters who Jordan - as Hemingway's voice - often considers untrustworthy, repugnant and treacherous. Rather contradictory, I would say. And Jordan's fatalistic sense of duty to a cause of questionable politics and in a country that isn't even his own is just plain strange to say the least.Interesting as character study, and a microcosm of the Spanish Civil War, but very depressing.",0
"i was ticked when the 4th book didn't finish the series, as promised.  I became truly pissed after I read ADWD and found an amazing lack of progress in the story.  After coming to Amazon to check on progress, hoping against despair that the series might conclude, I find that a total of 12 books are expected. I'm finished with GRRM, who cannot keep his promises.",0
"I had never heard of this author, and was amazed at the sample, so purchased the first 4.  I didn't know at that point that the series didn't end with 4.  I was so caught up in it, I couldn't stop (not much else got done).  The non-end irritated me severely, but bought book 5, thinking all things would come together.  My first thought at the end was WTF??  Not only did it not end, it didn't get anywhere.  Now, I'm p*ssed at having spent my money on an endless rollercoaster ride, and even worse, I'm bored with it.  I'd like to know how it ends, but by the time the next book comes out, I'm going to have forgotten half the characters and won't care.  I'll save my money & get it from the library.  Maybe.",0
"If you're looking for complex development across a large array of characters or amazing descriptions of settings, this is your book!  If you're seeking plot advancement, this book is like watching grass grow...on Quaaludes.  It seems to me that Martin started off this series strong, but lost control over his storyline over the past two installments.  Things have gotten a little too complex to move the story forward smoothly.  And given the pace at which Martin writes, it's a gamble as to whether or not I'll live long enough to see him finish this series off (I'm 55 - really just jabbing here at the years between book releases).  I hope Martin regains the magic in the next book.2 stars...zzzzzzzzzzzzz.",0
"I did NOT expect this graphic brutality when I bought this book; circus animals killed because of lack of food or just laziness on the part of the handlers. The story starts off in an engaging way, Jake the old man in the nursing home was entertaining. But there were too many instances of animals being abused/killed that I could not finish this book as it seemed to become the main focus. Too many animals in life are mistreated as it is and I do not need this information shoved in my face via a novel. This book should come with a warning to potential readers right on the front cover.",0
"My previous review disappeared, and even though it's been years since I read this garbage, I'm still so angry about the time and money wasted, I feel I must add my voice back into the mix.

I appreciate getting the book at the great price.  I'm really not complaining but the book was quite yellow and the jacket was torn in various places.  It looked like it was on the shelf for quite a while........Maureen,0
"First let me state that I am a big fan of the series but am very disappointed in the direction the last 2 books have taken. I'm 3/4 through this book and have completely lost interest and lost track of half the characters. Most of the new characters are shallow and could easily have been left out. So far, most of the original characters are barely mentioned or not even mentioned at all. Mr Martin, get back to the basics of your original book, please.",0
"Gods be good.  Has George R.R. Martin descended into some Sisyphean hell where he is forever condemned to pen a saga he has come to detest?  Apparently wearied of Westeros, he appears to pine instead for persianesque climes.  But, unlike the One Thousand and One Nights, these 1016 pages are unlikely to beguile either king or commoner.Even before this volume, Martin evidences a slipping of the literary leash.  Not only does his continued killing off of important characters often feel arbitrary and capricious, but the methodical physical and psychological maiming of the remaining protagonists cripples the story itself.  Deaths and devastating injuries should be significant in fiction.  They should propel a plot in an importantly different direction.  So far, this has not happened in A Song of Ice and Fire.  There have been numerous opportunities for such an occurrence, but then a central figure is dispatched, and the particular narrative falters.By A Dance With Dragons, some of the original POV/subplots should be merging.  Instead, they are wafting farther apart and are being weakened in entanglements with dozens of new personages and precipitous plot swings.  At times, by fits and starts, the story seems to be morphing into a decidedly different tale.  But, then, such digressions prove to be mere dalliances as Martin purges his yarn of one more character with whom he has apparently become bored.  It makes a reader want to bite her lip in despair.  For Martin's writing style is just as bold and true as ever.  His descriptions are finely drawn and deliberate and his dialogue as crisp and engaging as in A Game of Thrones.Hardcore fans are bound to engage this book, even if they have to endure legions of new characters, whether nameless wildlings or non-Westerosi with non-memorable monikers.  Such fans will do so simply to revel in the further (mis)adventures of Tyrion, Jon, Cersei, Dany, et alia.After all, Winds of Winter is coming.",0
"I'm sure the 7 short stories by Agatha Christie are excellent as usual.  The problem is that if you are looking for the Audio Edition read by JOAN HICKSON, this is NOT read by her.  Amazon is listing that she reads it, but this information is incorrect.  If you look carefully at the picture provided it shows that it is read by Geraldine McEwan.  This may be a fine rendition, but it is not THE Miss Marple as performed by Joan Hickson in audio and TV performances.",0
"I love Agatha Christie, however it took me three tries to finish this book. I must admit that there came a point during the third try when I decided to skip half of the very wordy dialog to finally get through. 95% of the dialog was by one person and most of that in his scheming lazy mind.  Just happy to be done!",0
I will not suffer the &#34;Jordan Syndrom&#34; twice in my life!  I will watch the show on HBO for the next 20 years to see how this ends.,0
"I am an Army veteran and I can tell you, Mr. Clancy got it all wrong.  I shall now tell you how and why.Mr. Clancy has no first hand knowledge of the military but he has powerful contacts (politicians and generals).  He  makes some calls and gets to look at all the latest gadgetry.  Unfortunately, the high ranking officers briefing him only show him the  best parts.  They gloss over the not so good stuff.  Clancy apparently  falls for it hook line and sinker!Here are some examples.  The laser  stuff at the National Training Center doesnt work near as well as Clancy  describes.  In all of my rotations, I never had laser equipment that  worked.  Also, the idea of two training regiments and a national guard  brigade making a cohesive fighting division is ludicrous.  Finally, such a  cobbled together unit could never steamroller an Iraqi/Iranian Army ten  times its size as Clancy describes.This is probably the end of the road  for me.  Unless Mr. Clancy gets back the magic he used to have.  This will  be the last of his books I will read.",0
"Having read all the others, bought this to complete the collection. It's so dragging, I read maybe a page a day then put it down. Maybe I will finish it before the next one comes out, and hope that is better. Every penny (cent) of this purchase is wasted. Should have taken it from the library instead",0
"I thought Martin had hit rock bottom in the last book, so I thought 'no where to go but up', right?  WRONG!  Sideways is evidently a new direction for authors, who have obviously never taken 10th grade English and do not know what plot sequence means.I do not know who the other 3000 or so people are who gave this book 3,4,or 5 stars, but they must be on someone's payroll, (wink wink), because this series is just getting worse and worse. Do not waste your money. I used an Amazon credit, so thankfully, I am not feeling too swindled. If you feel you must read this, get it from the Library.",0
"This is really a classic fantasy trilogy?  This is really the guy who wrote Tigana, A Song for Arbonne, and The Lions of Al Rassan?  I must be missing something.  I know that millions of people should  not be able to be this wrong, but in this case they most certainly are.This is probably one of the worst fantasy novels I have ever read.  Nothing that happens seems to be natural, but happens because the author wants it to happen.  No characters seem to be alive, but only exist because the author needs them to exist.  The conversations are stilted and dull.  Nothing works in this novel.In the reviews, there seems to be a consensus that things get better later in the series, but I say so what?  This book stinks and the fact is there are better starts to better series.  The sad thing is that I was / am a big Kay fan.If you like the standard, derivative, sub par, fantasy, then eat your heart out.  If you are like me and read Tigana, read the Lions of Al Rassan, A Song for Arbonne, read the Sarantine Mosaic, heard that Kay's first work was a trilogy and got real excited to see what he could do with traditional fantasy, then do not bother.  Trust me, you will be very disappointed.",0
"I had high expectations for this, but it was kind of a chore to finish.  It was too depressing!  Too much brutality to the circus animals AND the circus humans, drunkenness, filth, squalor -- plus the portrait of life in the nursing home was grim.  When the narrator finally gets his true love, the author rushes through it in a few sentences and then goes back to the grimness.  I give her two stars because she's obviously done a lot of research on circuses, and I thought the photos were charming.",0
"Despite Stephen Donaldson's admitted writing talents, complemented with inventive and original concepts, the content of his work has progressively and dramatically declined since the writing of the classic fantasy sextet,  &quot;The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant,&quot; almost two decades ago.  Followed by the good but unmemorable fantasy &quot;Mirror of Her  Dreams,&quot; with the &quot;Gap&quot; series he has chosen to turn his  talents  instead to science fiction.  It is hardly a success.I forced  myself to read both the first and second books in this series, mainly, I  suppose, out of loyalty to the memory of the earlier &quot;Covenant&quot;  series.  However, whereas there the protagonist possessed a dark side that  enriched as well as leavened the realism and humanity of the tale, in the  &quot;Gap&quot; Donaldson has chosen to revel in the singular immorality  and depravity of his characters.  The end result is an unrelentingly dark  world totally devoid of humanity or an inkling of compassion, with  protagonists obsessed solely with their own selfish purpose.  There is a  determined absence of the interplay between the potential for both good and  evil that coexists in all humanity.  Instead the world of the  &quot;Gap&quot; is devoted to characters pathologically oblivious to  anything outside their own primitive survival and, more often than not,  perverse desires.  There is not a single sympathetic character to which one  can attach much response beyond disgust.  While it is obvious from reading  other reviews that Donaldson has found an audience for this work, his  creation here reflects a unremitting cynicism and misanthropy that, while I  recognize its existence in the world, I would prefer not to dwell in  entirely.  And this book is too preoccupied and single-minded in it's  desire to explore the depths of human depravity for me to applaud the  quality of it's writing. Conceptually without merit and one of the least  engaging works I have read in some time.",0

"Not  Sidney Sheldon's best, could not get in to it, will try another later!All the other books he wrote were great!",0
"I give up. I can't even finish reading this because it's just too painful to experience the disconnect from the previous books in the series. Nothing much seems to happen, characters argue and talk and eat and travel. When things do happen they don't really seem to make sense. Most chapters involving characters from the first three books just don't ring true in some way.I'm not completely convinced that GRRM actually wrote the majority of this book. It simply doesn't build on what has come before. Old characters spin their wheels while unnecessary new characters pop into existence. The only explanation I can think of is that this book was constructed and edited with future seasons of the TV series in mind.Dance With Dragons feels like it was ghost written by somebody who has no real emotional connection to the old characters. Classic TV plot devices like cliffhangers and reversed deaths are used with abandon. Shocking dramatic events often had a huge emotional impact in the earlier books. But here they just feel like manipulative plot devices for ending a TV episode.It's really quite shocking just how bad this huge, meandering mess of a book is. It's hard for me to imagine anybody giving it a five star review. But, then again, I always underestimate the degree to which people become emotionally invested in works of fiction.My advice is to avoid this book. In fact, don't even start the book series if you haven't already. Just enjoy the HBO TV series. The producers on HBO are likely to keep the plot moving along nicely. Also you are guaranteed to get one new season per year for as long as it runs. In contrast the book series has jumped the rails, hurtled down the ravine and crashed into a great steaming mass of debris.",0

"I just finished reading Red Mars and was so disappointed. This book had so much potential going into it, but in short the characters suck. The main characters in Red Mars are all part of the first 100 people to colonize Mars. You don't get to meet all 100 of them (thank god), but out of the ones you do meet there is not one of them that is likeable. This lack of any characters to get attached to or even like a little makes reading Red Mars a painful experience. There are some good ideas about Mars, the technology to live there, and ways to terraform it all presented from characters that are just not enjoyable.",0
"Lovers of Westeros,We all wanted this book to take us back to an age where the lord of bards, George R.R. Martin, had the guts, the energy, and the gumption for true storytelling. That is to say: We wanted the pace, the plot, the people, and the passion of the first three books. The unfortunate reality, however, is that this book delivers none of these. It is a commercial product designed to fulfill a contract and to make a publisher money. Of course, there is nothing wrong with this. Nothing at all. But don't think for a second that this tree-killing monster is anything more than that.Three things you need to know before buying this tripe:1. There will be no sixth book; at least not one written by GRRM. He (or his publishers) will do what Robert Jordan did. (Not a bad solution, really.)2. At least half of the ""five star"" reviews have been written by GRRM's friends and fans, the same folks who would give five stars to a steaming turd dropped from the Wall so long as it came from GRRM's well lubricated bowels.3. Take a look at other major f/sf series here on Amazon. Nowhere -- I mean nowhere -- will you see such a collection of one star reviews. Do you know why that is? Because this book is trash. Period. And the world knows it.Remember when GRRM told us fans ""to get a life?"" Back when we were all waiting for FFC? Remember that?Time for him to take his own advice.FINAL WORD: Trash. Pure and simple.0.5 STARS",0
"Um, the situation described in this book is completely impossible.  I guess the author did not pay attention when dominant and recessive genes were discussed in science class.  Sheesh.",0
I would have given this book no stars but that is not an option.This book is horrendous. I cannot imagine anyone with a lick of intelligence actually enjoying this trash. I threw it away after 25 pages.,0
"The book has a clever and interesting story. The problem I have is that when I read a novel I want to immerse myself in the story maybe even soak in it. In the Clancy novel there are several separate, but connected through the &#34;hero&#34;,  stories that are somewhat overlapping. The author shuffles back and forth in and out of the various story lines gradually bringing them all together at the end. I accept that some may well enjoy this up and down roller coaster technique but for me the warm inside soaking experience I&#8217;m wanting, is constantly being ripped apart. Thus for me 2 stars.",0
"I loved the first 3 books, and got through each in about a week.  The 4th was not as good for reasons folks have already mentioned, but it still was readable despite some of my favorite characters being saved for book 5.After almost 1 month, I am only 1/3 through the book and despair of finishing it.  I have skipped some chunks that were most tedious, but even the chapters where my favorite characters (those few that have not been killed off or MIA), the story is not compelling.I guess these last 2 books are bridges for the next one, but good luck getting through this one.Maybe he is distracted by the HBO series, or HBO is influencing the story, but I fear I will have to put this book to rest after one last attempt.",0
"It must be very difficult to write 1000 pages where nothing important happens. Possibly this is why it took 5 years for MARTIN to write the book. Aside from the obvious lack of plot,internal inconsistances are everywhere One of the most obvious is Daenerys'once invincible army is now for no reason, powerless. New characters are intoduced by the dozens for no apparent purpose other then filling pages. Old characters you do care about are ignored or killed off,again for no apparent reason other then filling up pages.Every book even those in a series should stand on its own, this book does not rise to that level. It is filler plain and simple, often well written but filler nonetheles.All and all a disservice to his many readers",0
"Where to begin?  Mary was not the youngest Boleyn, but the oldest.  She was not an innocent teenager when she began her affair with Henry; she had already earned a bad reputation during her youth in France.  There is no convincing evidence that her family pushed her into Henry's bed, or that they were rewarded for doing so.  Her father and her husbands were already faithful servants of the king; the titles and lands they received from him were no more than what would be expected for their service.  The king made some provision for Mary's daughter Catherine, who was almost certainly his, but none for her son Henry, who probably was not.  There is no evidence that Anne ever slept with Percy, or that she poisoned anybody, or that there was a secret band of homosexuals gathered around her at court, or that she ever considered incest with her brother.On the contrary, the Boleyns were known for their devotion to the Reformers' cause, long before the king's eye landed on the younger daughter of the house.  As queen, Anne gave generously to support the New Learning and appointed Reforming priests where she could.  She was little liked by the mass of the people, who never really gave her a chance, but there were also those who respected her - such as Archbishop Crammer, who owed his career to her intervention.  For a better account of her and her sister, read... almost anything else.  But specifically Mary Boleyn: Mistress of Kings by Alison Weir or To Die For: A Novel of Anne Boleyn by Sandra Byrd.",0
"I will not get it because I'm fed up with Westeros, the imaginary land where it takes place, as well as the characters and the whole thing. Number four (got the paper back version) was really frustrating and boring. I did enjoy  the first two books. Reading number 3 was quite disappointing but I managed to finish it. Reason? Martin's a great writer, no doubt but as of book 3, the original Story-line and characters start to fade out or just vanish. The remaining ones, after some FOUR THOUSAND PAGES are still pretty much the same age (Not even Homer's Illiad does that!),- (boring)... It 'is' a ""saga"", only because it all takes place in Westeros . So Westeros IS the main character! (and whores, and BLOODY CRUEL MURDERS, and ""bastard-borns""... and MORE cruelty and treason...ENOUGH...MORE THAN ENOUGH!!) Too much of the same for me.",0
"The only reason that I did not enjoy this long read was: it's focus on the hardcore Sci-Fi reader. I'm not saying it's a bad book, just not for me. The author crams so much geology,theology, psychiatry,topography and much more in the book that it all becomes overwhelming.  He seems to remind us throughout the entire read(which I couldn't wait to end)about the same terrain over and over, the color of the sky and the types of volcanoes,mountains,craters,cracks and more craters with the same explanation. To hardcore for me. A true fan of any book about the colonization of Mars, you will love it. I couldn't wait to leave the planet.For better books based on Mars, I would suggest Robert Heinlein's ""Red Planet""(see my review) or Ray Bradbury's ""The Martian Chronicles"".",0

I'm all for books that have no purpose other than to entertain, but the Cross character seems arbitrarily black, like that, by definition, gives him a personality; I didn't buy any of the rest of it, either.  I think a book is cheating when the only reason you're reading it is because you want to know what happens not because you care, but because it would irritate you not to know.  This book cheats.  Bigtime.  I recommend Ridley Pearson or Richard North Patterson if you want something in the genre that's at least decent.  I would have given it no stars, but they wouldn't let me.",0
"Good concept in terms of time, place and description of depression era circus life.  Writing is passable, but observations on human character are WEAK.  I regret reading this and should have just gone to the movie.",0
"I had just finished reading ""The Autobiography of Henry VIII: With Notes By His Fool, Will Somers"" by Margaret George and was interested in learning more about about that time. A group of acquaintances heartily & gushingly recommended ""The Other Boleyn Girl"".Fortunately, my copy came from a thrift store, because I cannot finish it. I'm not even at page 75 yet and I'm seriously hating it. The most eye-rolling passage for me was Mary's description of her stay at her family's country estate all by herself (with the exception of the  servants), and her discussions with local farmers, plus the story about how she secured seed for a crop for some of them. Please.If Ms. Gregory is the feminist she claims to be, she would do well to write more accurately about history and and less sensationally. The truth is usually much more interesting anyway.I'll be combing these 1 and 2 star reviews for recommendations of better accounts of the time and of Anne Boleyn.",0
"Okay... I'll admit I was drawn to this book by the upcoming movie previews and, like most, I had to read it prior to the films release.There is no way the written word will outshine the movie this time. It can't and won't even come close. The character's alone, (Reese Witherspoon and Robert Pattinson) will redeem the satirical shallowness and cliched style simply with their screen presence.As with many of the comments already noted, this book is just not believable. I can totally comprehend how Rosie, an ginormous creature can pull a stake from the ground, okay... even sneek away for a drink or two or ten. But please, pulling the stake and splitting a skull in the midst of such chaos??? I think a more realistic death for him would have been...death by stampede!But more importantly (at least for me)... I would love a comment from ANYONE who can tell me how the Bible's story of Jacob (Genesis) was incorporated into this novel! Did I miss something??? I just don't get it! I say!",0
"I am getting a little impatient with this series. I want to like it, but really, must every likeable character get the shaft? And I feel that the plot has run away with itself.",0
Not as good as the first few but I will hope the next will be better..I have hope the series will be entertaining.,1
"I know I'm going to aggravate most die hard Clancy fans by giving this three stars but hey, it's an 'OK' book.  Could have been about 300 pages less and still got his point across. I did like how Kelly took out an entire gang with ease throughout the book. It just seemed like there was too much going on for all this to be believable though. Come on, the guy is planning a raid on a Vietnam POW camp like the real life 'Bo Gritz' and at the same time is putting away the local bloods and crips with a K Bar.This book would have gotten a better rating for me if less time was spent on the rehab of a drug addict and more time spent on the POW camp raid. (I had no idea before reading this book that it was also about American POW's so that was a nice surprise.) All that buildup for.... Well I don't want to spoil anything but there only about 3 pages out of the 750 that dealt with the snatch of that Russian officer. I think that in the time frame we were dealing with, the local cops wouldn't have cared much if a guy was wasting the local drug dealers. Maybe in today's world they would have to put on a dog and pony show with interviews and the whole nine after pressure from civil rights, but not in the late 60's early 70's.In the end, this book falls short of explaining to the reader exactly why Clark is the special ops/covert guy he is today.",1
"Well, he's finally gone.  George MacDonald Fraser died a couple of days ago at 82.  Like the good trooper he was, he kept cranking 'em out right 'til the end, concluding his stellar writing career with FLASHMAN ON THE MARCH and THE REAVERS.  No longer will we fans be able to look forward to yet one more tour-de-force from this master craftsman.  Aye, well...as Flashy would say.  Not only was GMF a master of the written English word, he was a master storyteller in the old tradition--unmatched when it came to entrancing his readership with his eloquence, humor, irreverence, brilliant characterizations, and meticulous historical research.  He hit one out of the park the first time he stepped up to the plate with FLASHMAN back in 1969.  This is still one of the very best of the twelve Flashman novels, though the least of these is ten times better than the best effort of nearly every other author I can think of.  I'll greatly miss GMF's writing, particularly Flashman, but he left a wealth of fine books in his wake (including what I think may the best, most perceptive and heartfelt personal memoir of World War Two combat ever written: QUARTERED SAFE OUT HERE), all which we can still enjoy and learn from.  So I'll have glass of brandy tilted up to George MacDonald Fraser tonight--with a wary nod to Flashy, who's apt to be lurking around on the periphery somewhere--and take comfort that after he claps arms with Foshie and Grandarse and the rest of Nine Section, he'll probably spend the rest of the winter comparing notes with Thomas Hughes and Raphael Sabatini...not to mention Palmerston, Grant, Lincoln, Lakshmibai, Spotted Tail, Bismarck, and Yakub Beg--just to name a few.  Godspeed, Mr. Fraser, and thanks.",1
"Let me start by saying I am a Herman Wouk Fan.  I love the Caine Mutiny and even like this book very much as well as War and Rememberance.  I like the historical research done to support as the framework for these books.  I like how he has created a character like Pug Henry that interacts with the key leaders and players of WWII during critical times.  Excellent military detail.Now the bad.  Take the Jastrows, Rhoda and Briny and punch them all in the face until they are no longer stupid one dimensional characters.  I realize that they exist to make poor decisions so that we can see the resulting evil of the Nazi's, but come on.  It is almost as if Wouk does not respect his female characters, they are so shallow and predictable.  I have no use for Rhoda Henry, who is really just an elitist, Hoe.  Her husband toils and works his ass off, but she just can't rationalize enough for her own happiness.  I can't believe that Natalie is an intellectual and brilliant, making some of the dumbest remarks and decisions in the book, just to be petulant and have her own way.Byron, Briny, just needs his ass kicked and told to man up.  What a baby.Anyway, for historical research, excellent, for shallow, selfish, petulant characters, thunbs down.",1
"I spent most of this book disliking it. I hated the constant depiction of cruelty to animals and people; I hated the griminess inherent in the depiction of circus life; and I hated the naivete of main character Jacob Jankowski, the poor veterinary student forced by a cruel twist of fate to seek shelter and employment with the Benzini Brothers traveling circus.It took me forever to make it through the first 100 pages, and the only reason I stuck with it was because I was just too lazy to go pick out another book to read. This is the one that was on my bed so this is the one I picked up to read every night before going to sleep.Finally I reached the 100th page and was ready to turn to something else, but to my surprise, I realized that I wanted to know what was going to happen. I had become interested in the character of Rosie the elephant, who was rescued from another show, and I wanted to make sure things came out all right for her in the end. I actually read the entire last third of the book in one setting. I still wasn't enjoying it, mind you, but I was really worried about Rosie!I am not going to relate the plot because I don't want to give any spoilers, but let me just say that the ending of the book was one of the sweetest, most satisfying book endings I have ever read in my life. I still don't like the book, but I love the ending!",1
"Water for Elephants is told by and about Jacob Jankowski, a cranky but likable 90 year old (or perhaps 93) man who resides in an assisted living center.  The story maintains its momentum by alternating between the past and the present as Jacob recalls the circumstances under which he found himself traveling with the Benzini Brothers Circus.Through Jacob, the author Sara Gruen, presents us with a fascinating history of the American circus as well as a painful look at the time known as ""The Great Depression"". Gruens storytelling technique is enhanced by the period circus photos (circa 1920-30) that appear at the beginning of each chapter.The eccentricities of the characters as well as the alarming treatment of both animals and performers propels the story and mezmerizes the reader.  The complicated interpersonal relationships of the circus ""family"" is deftly interwoven with that of the rest home ""family"".I was truly seduced by this book.  Reading it was an unexpected and astonishing adventure that continued to resonate long after I had read the last page and closed the book.",1
"I have fallen in love with all the characters in this book, whether its because I truly love them or just love to hate them! I can't wait for the next book to see where the story continues!",1
Very good reading and I could not put my Kindle down.  Good insight into circus life.  Will have to research for other books from this author.,1
"The title gives you the short version, now here comes the longer one.  I'm reading Ms. Scottoline's works in order, so this is number 5.  In Rough Justice, she reprises Mary DiNunzio's character from book 1 and if my notes are right, (Ms.) Bennie Rosata's from book 3 -- which is nice because we're really getting inside these character's personalities which adds to the fun.  The basic premise this time is that a guest hot-shot lawyer from out of town, Marta Richter, has just heard from her client, who, thanks to Marta's hard work, is heading toward a self-defense acquittal for killing an alleged carjacker, a confession that it was murder after all.  She immediately spends the rest of the book trying to get back at him (not too sure about the &quot;legality&quot; of that), with help from Bennie's associates Mary and Judy.  The plot is actually quite good, with a lot of twists and turns, culminating in a very good ending that had me turning pages late into the night.  A number of additional corpses prevent this from being all sweetness and light, yet I think the outcome seemed fitting.  My only gripe was that 2/3 of the book took place during such a bitter and deep snowstorm that roads were closed and cities crippled.  Yet Marta manages to drive back and forth from Philly to the Jersey shore (!), with all kinds of shenanigans there, while the troops back at the law firm are out all night pulling the same stunts, even interviewing people at 2 o'clock in the morning!Anyhow, &quot;Rough&quot; is a welcome addition to the growing Scottoline repertoire; I'll certainly be back for more, and I can overlook a little bit of unlikely traipsing around by the women for a story this entertaining!  Try it.",1
"Journalist Joanna Clifford is researching regression by hypnosis for an article she is writing. In 1970 Jo herself was hypnotized, but remembers very little about the incident. What she doesn't know is that she nearly died during the session, her heart having stopped, and the hypnotherapist gave her a mental suggestion so that she would not remember anything that occurred.Now, 15 years later, Jo has agreed to be hypnotized again for her research. Her old flame Nick is adamantly trying to talk her out of it, while his brother Sam is as well. However after the first session, Jo regresses to 800 years in the past and finds herself seeing her life through the eyes of Matilda de Braose, The Lady of Hay.Before she knows it, Jo's hypnotic trances are getting really vivid and she is having a hard time distinguishing what's real from what happened to Matilda. She learns that Matilda was unhappily married to William, but was secretly in love with Richard de Clare. She experiences Matilda's pain and heartache. Jo even finds herself missing Richard and wanting to regress just to be able to be with him, if only in a trance.While under hypnosis, Jo experiences Matilda giving birth to her first born son. When Jo awakens she find herself having post-partum symptoms. She also misses the baby and hears him crying at night.Jo starts to think that she may have at one point in time actually been the Lady of Hay, and is just now remembering her past life. She also insists on being hypnotized again and again until she finds out what became of Matilda. But soon enough, scared of what is happening to her, she tries to make herself forget Matilda, to no avail.At 571 pages, Lady of Hay is a pretty hefty book. It took me about 100+ pages in to get hooked on the story. All the while, I didn't really relate to any of the characters, but I was curious about what was going to happen next. The plot fascinated me, but some of the characters annoyed me, mostly the men in Jo's life. There's some physical violence during the current day storyline, and the female characters put up with it, which had me shaking my head as I read.I found the scenes where Jo would regress into Matilda's life to be really interesting. That's when the book really took a turn into the historical fiction element of the story. Barbara Erskine makes a smooth transition from Jo's world to Matilda's and vice versa. You can also tell that the author did alot of research for the book. The events and people in Matilda's world are well detailed.The plot is full of drama, backstabbing, time travel and a touch of romance. I liked the paranormal element to the book as well. There's alot going on in this story and I found myself hooked from the second half of the book until the end.",1
Love this whole series and am patiently (sort of) waiting for the next instalment.  One of the best fantasy/adventure series that i've ever read.,1
"If you like historical fiction this is a must read.  You will come to love Red Orm and his adventures.  But you will also learn a lot of history about Denmark, England, Norway, Sweden, etc.  I kept repeatedly referring to Wikipedia to read more about the kings and others that Orm kept meeting up with.  I also found out that our modern day bluetooth was named after King Harald Bluetooth!  I highly recommend this book to any fan of historical fiction.",1
"Love the series, love the author, and best of all I love that I could get it on my Kindle right away with no wait.",1
"This well-known author of historical fiction has outdone herself with this  rich and absorbing tale of the notorious Boleyn sisters, Anne and Mary. The Tudor court, with all its pomp and intrigue, is seen through the eyes of the beautiful Mary Boleyn, who at the age of fourteen arrives at court and becomes lady-in-waiting to Katherine of Aragon, Queen of England and wife to King Henry VIII.  Although already married to courtier William Carey, Mary captures the heart of King Henry VIII, whose roving eyes land on this innocent young miss.In the eyes of  the grasping and greedy Boleyn family, Mary is but the fatted calf through whom their ambitions, they believe, will become realized. So, they offer her up as a sacrifice to their ruthless ambition. Forced to separate from her husband in order to become the King's mistress, Mary betrays the Queen and becomes mistress to the King, all at the behest of her family. Every step of her affair is choreographed from the wings by her family, with the adept aid of her sly and clever sister, Anne, in the role of chief manipulator.Mary struggles with her own code of honor and personal morality, which is often in conflict with what is mandated by her family. Still, despite her best intentions, Mary disappoints them, as her nature is not the kind that takes well to intrigue and manipulation, as she has sincere feelings of affection for the King, as well as for the Queen. After bearing the King two children, however, she is set aside by a formidable rival, her own sister, Anne, in whom  the Boleyn family now place their hopes and ambitions.This is, first and foremost,  the story of Mary Boleyn, a woman who has generally been reduced to a footnote in history. It is notable, however, that she was the only Boleyn sibling to survive the purges of the Tudor court and who, ultimately, married for love in an age when this was not the norm among those of her class.  It is also the story of Anne Boleyn, her rise and fall, as seen through the eyes of her sister, Mary, with whom Anne was to have a lifelong rivalry.To a  lesser degree, it is also the story of their brother, George, a more remote, though no less interesting, personage. His interjection into the story is necessary, as the author attempts to address the issue of incest that arose at the trial of George and Anne Boleyn. She gives quite an interesting perspective on the issue, weaving it, part and parcel, into the story in an effort to explain his downfall, as well his betrayal by his own wife.Told against the magnificent backdrop of the Tudor Court in all its splendor and majesty, the author weaves a complex tale of greed, ambition, sex, and political machination, as well as unparalleled intrigue, in sixteenth century England. Filled with well-fleshed characters taken right out of the annals of history, the story is one that is sure to delight all those with a love for well-written historical fiction. In particular, fans of beloved author, Jean Plaidy, will enjoy this book.",1
"Highly original. The characters don't think and act like twentieth century ones - O'Brian has really made an effort to offer people from a different age and mindset. Their values are so different. The heroes do foolish things at times, they have good and bad luck, it's pretty unpredictable (although you're sure that somewhere Jack Aubrey will win some sea battles with courage and skill). How the hell would I know, but he seems to know what he's talking about with the minutiae of 18th century ships, and the mores and attitudes of a range of people. I think I read somewhere that he's done a lot of research into the (often very well documented) battles of the time, and said that all the sort of adventures and actions Jack Aubrey experiences did actually happen - but they just never would have all happened to the one guy.Interesting narrative style too - more like a TV show which just cuts to new scenes without bothering to link them. One second Maturin's home writing in his diary, the next he's on board chatting to Jack. It isn't that hard to work it out (despite no visual cues), and I suppose omits a lot of really unnecessary padding - but I haven't come across this style before.O'Brian isn't trying too hard to make us identify and sympathise with people `just like us', so often the assumption of the historical novel, but to enjoy some of the remarkable dissimilarities and events of a wonderfully alternate place.",1
I couldn't put it down.  I've been reading Ms. Scottoline's books for years now and I loved reading about the early years of Bennie Rosato.  Thanks for a great read.,1
An excellent trilogy.  Hard-bounds were an upgrade from the paperbacks on my shelf.  Quality and service were excellent.  Would order from the company again.,1
"90-ish Jacob Jankowski narrates his story in flashbacks from a nursing home. His days with the circus feel more real and alive to him than his current reality.After his parents are killed in a car accident, Jacob runs out on his vet school exams and joins the circus. Circus life is not always easy, but Jacob has experiences with humans and animals that change his life forever.Gruen brings the Depression-era circus vividly to life, along with its many colorful characters. If Rosie the elephant and Bobo the orangutan don't touch your heart, it's made of stone!Highly recommended!",1
This historic look at circus life was interesting and kept me reading for hours. I would highly recommended it for anyone.,1
"I actually wanted to give this book a 4.5 because it was more than your average ""I like it"" 4, but not quite the brain-exploding-spectacular 5. It was close, though. When I started reading, I wasn't sure if I'd like it; the story started slowly and felt disjointed at times. By the time I was about half-way through, however, I was flying through the pages, sneaking off to read every moment I could spare. I even read in the middle of the work day! Crazy. But it was that good. The circus culture of the early 1900s always intrigues me, particularly where it relates to animals. Gruen treated the topic with affection and accuracy, both of which she deftly imparts to the reader. I love Rosie the Elephant. A word to the wise: this novel was fairly gritty both for violence and sex, so not for YA readers.",1
Didn't expect to enjoy this as much as I did. Really fascinating characters that had me very absorbed.Excellent story with many unexpected twists & turns. Definitely worthwhile.An ending that will surprise.,1
"I don't normally write reviews, but Red Mars (and the rest of the trilogy) is my favorite book of all time. It's true that hardcore spaceflight enthusiasts may like this book more than a casual reader, but even my non-spaceflight enthusiast friends rave about this book. Robinson does an excellent job building up an ensemble cast of unique personalities who you as the reader truly come to know as real people. I feel like I have known the characters in this book as if they were real people.In addition to the wonderful cast of characters, there is the planet itself: Mars. Robinson makes Mars feel like a real place like no other. When I look at real maps of Mars, I see Burroughs, Underhill, Acheron, and Sabishii, the cities of Red Mars. The ancient landscape comes alive through his colorful and intricate descriptions. After reading Red Mars, the red planet will no longer be an abstract concept, it will be a location.I highly recommend this book to everybody I know, but if you are even remotely a science fiction, spaceflight, or engineering fan, you owe it to yourself to read this book (and its two sequels) as soon as possible.",1
"I was really impressed by this book. It's an old man's retelling of his younger days at a circus. He's currently in a nursing home. What's amazing is how she takes you inside his head and causes you to see events through his eyes, and his mind. You feel his frustration, his loneliness, and how he's misunderstood.Older people in the home are treated like children, but inside, they're cognizant, at least some of the time, and resent this treatment, but are helpless to prevent it.The details in the circus era are very well written. You're taught a lot about circus life, the fun, the dangerous, the dark underbelly. Maybe it's not representative; it is fiction, but you believe it. She takes you there.One of the most enjoyable fiction books I've read.",1
"I enjoyed this book in the beginning but then grew increasingly weary of it as it went along.  This book was not overly-long, page-wise, but it felt that way to me.  As a matter of fact, towards the end of the book, I  actually started skimming which is something that I *never* do.The main  character was extremely unlikeable and I didn't like him any better after  he betrayed his client by giving locks of the dead girls' hair to the old  woman for her to turn into the police.  (Sorry, I am a lawyer and have no  tolerance for such things.  I am not a criminal lawyer, and never could be  because I wouldn't want to defend people I believed to be guilty.  But,  once undertaking their representation, however, I would not betray them as  it is professionally unethical).I also had no feeling whatsoever for the  accused killer.  He didn't inspire fear, or loathing, or sympathy, or much  of anything.  I kept waiting for something to happen with his character,  and nothing ever did.The author's style reminded me a little bit of  Nelson DeMille.  That is - the somewhat-unsympathetic main male character  with a sarcastic sense of humor.  But I have enjoyed DeMille's works far  more than this.I don't recommend this book and I doubt I will read this  author's works again.",1
"What could be better than Hemmingway?  More Hemmingway.I learned about this short epilogue on the program ""Hemmingway in Cuba"" was broadcast April 6, 2013 on my local pbs station.  There is a joint effort by Cuban and American scholars to preserve all the materials left at his home in Cuba.  I am not a scholar, but want to share this with other readers of Hemmingway.This Epilogue for ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" was found in the basement of Finca Vigia.EpilogueIt was night when Golz rode in a staff car on the road down from the pass to El Escorial.",1
Wonderful book. I liked the audio book on my long drive to and from work. I liked how the voice changed from young to older. I'm glad I read/listened to the book before I saw the movie. I liked the book better than the movie,1
"I remember this beloved book from when I was a child and first learning to read. I loved it then, as I do now. I recently bought a replacement copy FOR MYSELF, as my children misplaced it somewhere along the way. My lady asked me for whom I was purchasing the book and I responded truthfully, ""Me."" Gotta love the Berenstain Bears! I do, and I'm 47! I find myself often reciting the book whenever I'm feeling the need for a little lift of my mood and a spontaneous smile. Indulge yourself and any little ones in your life. You won't regret owning this classic.",1
"I've been reading Tom Clancy since 1989, when my dad gave me copies of Hunt for Red October and Red Storm Rising as I left for college. I've loved most of his work (things started going seriously south with Rainbow Six), in particular Without Remorse. A few weeks ago, I decided that I wanted to revisit this favorite, so I purchased the Kindle edition.This novel focuses on the events leading to John Kelly's transformation into Mr. Clark, a central figure in several of the Jack Ryan-centric novels. Largely absent from Without Remorse is Clancy's typical wide-angle view of events with periodic zooms into the events in one setting or another, though it's clear that the historical context shapes the story. The story is well-paced and Clancy does a solid job of making us care about the central characters.The Kindle edition of Without Remorse, however, reads like someone tore the pages out of the novel and scanned them into the computer using a version of OCR software dating back to the mid-90s. There are quite a lot of mangled words, spacing is often weird, and punctuation frequently doesn't make sense. If you can overlook this sort of thing, the Kindle edition will work just fine for you. If you find that such problems interrupt the flow of the story, as I do, you're better off passing on the Kindle version and tracking down a hard copy from your local library or used book store.",1
I have already read several books from this author and find them very informative and it really gives you a insight into what it must have been like during this time.,1
"As with other Clancy novels the abominable attempt at creating dialogue is made tolerable by the superior plot. In this book Clancy has decided to end just about every sentence of dialogue with the word &#34;ok&#34; and followed with a question mark. I've never met anyone who ended that many sentences by saying &#34;ok?&#34;. I found it somewhat distracting, but after a while it becomes easier to ignore. Dialogue excluded, I'd give it 5/5.",1
"I listened to Water for Elephants as an audiobook.  The portrayal of old man Jacob by John Randolph Jones was spot on.  The enactment of the young Jacob by David LeDoux was good, but a little bit monotonous in tone.  He did do a good job on the other characters' voices, making them sound different from Jacob.  The book was well-written, with excellent characters who all had distinct personalities, and dialogue that rang true.  I bought the depression era plight of a young veterinary student doubly shocked at losing his parents and then their home.  This made a credible segue to his becoming the veterinarian for the Benzini Brothers circus.  Ms. Gruen does a believable portrayal of the Depression era, the working class, and the animals in the menagerie.  The story flows well, but is a bit melodramatic to my taste, in spots.  The love story between Jacob and Marlena works, but is a little long in development.  At first I did not see the relevance of the old Jacob interludes in the story, but they did lead to a sweet and appropriate ending to the book.I have one issue which maybe someone could answer.  I don't understand the relationship of the prologue to the rest of the book.  The text of the prologue duplicates the climactic event of the book itself, yet has a completely different outcome, and one that contradicts what happened ""in real life"".  I don't understand why there should be such a contradiction, and it wasn't explained by something like ""and then I woke up from the dream"".  Instead, the prologue merely ends with ""in 70 years I never told a single soul"" or something like this.  So why do we have a difference of fact between two parts of the book?  It is jarring and strange.  I also note that in the movie, the character, Uncle Al, was deleted when the screenplay was written.",1
"Circus life, during the American Depression. Told in the first person by Jacob Jankowski a young college boy who is suddenly orphaned and penniless and finds himself literally on board the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth! There's a prologue where we discover a secret which Jacob has kept for seventy years then we begin the story, alternating between 1931 and the modern day with an elderly Jacob.Very easy to read...I found myself flicking pages quickly. Gruen seems to capture the circus's attraction and glitz as well as it's often uncomfortable reality. The hierarchy from the roustabouts to the performers and bosses is fascinating and Gruen's descriptions bring to life the days when circuses had trains (conjuring up images from Dumbo!)The novel pulls you in, starting off slowly and ends up unputdownable as you have to find out what eventually happened/happens. I found the contrast between the way the Jacob of 'then' and 'now' is treated, both startling and thought provoking and ultimately I just really enjoyed reading about something I had little knowledge of, with a good twist in the tale.",1
"Lapierre writes this as if it were a novel.  I found it was a real page-turner and also educational. It is the story of what happened after India won its independence from Great Britain and decided to divide into India (for the Hindus) and Pakistan (for the Muslims).  It is hair-raising.  Gandhi played a major role.  Learning more about him was very interesting.  It is a bit too long, but well worth reading.",1
"After reading 5000+ pages of these characters I was highly disappointed in the ending of this book until I found out there were other books in the works.  I purposely waited to read this series until I thought the last book was published but I was surprised.  Now I am waiting along with untold amounts of people for the continuing saga.  I was missing the stories of Bran, Rickon and Jaime and Brianne.  I am a little tired of evil always winning out and would like to see a few of these characters put in their place, Hello Cersei, for a little bit longer.",1
"Jack commands the Boadicea, assigned to eliminate the French fleet capturing rich Indiamen around Mauritius.For the first time, O'Brian manages a ""proper"" novel format: this book starts with a goal, meets obstacles to achieving that goal, and ends with a resolution of that goal. More importantly, he continues his tradition of compelling characters in involving situations. I wasn't thrilled with the way poor Jack kept getting slammed with defeat after defeat, though. In addition, although thoroughly enjoyable and even re-readable, this book lacked the ""oomph"" that would have let me give it a 5 rating. Like all the books in this series, the conversion to e-text was done via OCR and not as carefully as I would have preferred. but the result is readable.",1
"Great book, I like the way the story moved between the character as an old man and his younger days in the circus.  However, the formatting in this book is so screwy, I'd often have to reread sentences so I could work out what they were saying and that really pulled me out of the story.  There were multiple instances of missing spaces between words and paragraph breaks in the middle of a sentence.  Did the publisher even have someone proofread the ebook version?",1
"This was a selection for our book group last month and although I'm glad I read it, I'm carting ASAP it to our local used bookstore since I don't have the stomach to read it again.I'll let other reviewers take care of the synopsis and author information. What struck me about this book was the author's handling of the violence against animals--human and otherwise. Sara Gruen takes the reader on some kind of amazing highwire act: we teeter on a fine line between wanting to throw the book down because we can't bear to read another page rife with brutality, yet still we are compelled to edge our way another inch closer to her bittersweet and satisfying (if somewhat unbelievable) conclusion.I'm interested to see what else Ms. Gruen has in store for us.",1
"I have mixed feelings about this book. I bought the paperback years ago and burned through the first third of it, thinking how awesome it was. Once into the second third or so, it doesn't take long before the pace dies and you find yourself falling asleep trying to finish it. I set it down.Years later, I thought I'd give it another try only to find that I had given it away, so I picked it up on Kindle. This time I did make it to the end, but wow was it painful. The writing is excellent. The characters are realistic. The science is sound. It.just.moves.soooooo.sloooooooow.",1
"This review will provide hints about the book that some may consider spoilers.  If you don't want ANY plot information about the book before you read it, you will not find this review helpful.  It is meant for fans who want to know what they're getting before they decide whether or not to invest time and money on this long-awaited novel.So, it's finally here: the excruciatingly-awaited fifth installment to George R.R. Martin's ""I eat  'epic' for breakfast"" A Song of Ice and Fire series.  I am sure that most fans of Martin's previous books in the series will already be familiar with the ""Meereen knot"" that was largely responsible for delaying this book all these years.  What those fans will want to know is whether Martin was able to solve that problem.  (For those who do not know, the ""Meereen knot"" is a reference to how many characters he -- apparently unwittingly -- sent to Meereen instead of sending Dany to Westeros.  Getting them all out of Meereen and over to Westeros was apparently a big problem for him.)  Unfortunately, the answer is a firm NO.  He spends this entire 900+ page tome pulling diligently at its strings but in the end, Dany, while admittedly no longer in Meereen, is still not demonstrably closer to conquering Westeros than she was in her last series appearance, and she finds herself in a much weaker position to do so than at the end ofA Storm of Swords (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 3).  In addition to that disappointment, several of the myriad random characters who were on their way to Meereen because of Dany and/or the dragons by the end ofA Feast for Crows (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 4)don't even make it to her.  So their stories still have to be straightened out and untangled and who knows how long that will take.Meereen and the doings there (or leading up to getting there) take up about half of the book and about a third is devoted to Jon Snow.  His actions at the Wall are exciting to read, as he makes extremely controversial decisions in order to prepare for what will obviously be an epic battle with the Others.  We don't learn anything new about the Others, unfortunately, but the pieces are in place for that battle, when (and if) it does come.  And his final chapter is the biggest cliffhanger in the book.  Sadly, there are a couple of obscure hints about his real identity but no solid information.Beyond these two main prongs, the last fourth of the book is filled with a few chapters from old characters whose stories give us a brief glimpse of what is happening north of the Wall and far to the south of it, with a couple of chapters peeking in on Arya in Bravos.  Fans will be pleased to know that Bran finally gets where he's going, and even if he doesn't do anything much of interest when he gets there the ""people"" he meets make for the most interesting additions to the ASoIaF world yet.  (Sadly, no positive ID on Coldhands though.)  One token Jaime chapter gives us a major clue about Brienne's cliffhanger ending in AFFC, but he himself doesn't do anything except mend some riverland fences.  Cersei's two chapters are satisfactory though they don't answer any major questions about her ultimate fate and we even get a one-chapter look at what's happening in Dorne through the eyes of our old friend Areo Hotah.  A left-for-dead character takes us through most of what's happening in the North without a Stark in Winterfell, and we also get Asha Greyjoy as a POV character for the first time.  We even get an answer to the question of whether that really was Davos whose hands and head were mounted by the Manderlys.  The one major missing puzzle piece is the Vale.  Sansa Stark doesn't appear at all, and there isn't a single character who sheds light on what Littlefinger might be getting up to or how his plots will ultimately impact the rest of the story.  And one character we've heard of but never formally met in anyone's narrative gets his own POV to introduce a new major character who is either a big red herring or a complete game changer.  Martin has already dropped hints that this person is just a red herring, so it's unclear why he chose to bring this guy in so late in the series and what his puzzling introduction will ultimately accomplish that actually benefits the main story.So on the whole, is it worth reading?  Absolutely.  If you're a fan and you haven't given up on the series despite the delays, you'll want to read this for sure.  And if it hadn't been for the long wait between books, I don't think there'd be QUITE as many naysayers for this novel.  It's not bad, by any means.  It's a little disappointing because of what is left out and because of what does NOT happen, but as long we don't wait five more years (or more!!) to get those questions answered, I think it's an acceptable entry into the series.  (And an acceptable second ""half"" ofA Feast for Crows (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 4))  The finale is being framed for us, but all we can see so far is a chunk of sky here, some red and black blurs there -- nothing that gives us a real hint of what the finished jigsaw puzzle will look like.  Based on Martin's own interview comments in the months leading up to this book's release, he is well aware of the dangers of not providing a satisfactory ending to a series.  I don't think this book is any reason for fans to lose hope in his ability to ultimately deliver a satisfying conclusion with the seventh book.  It's engrossing and filled with great scenes.  But as the fifth book in a series of seven, it is responsible for laying the final major pieces in place as we start ramping up for the conclusion.  At this point, it's impossible to say what all of those pieces are.  Only Martin knows for sure and his fans will know that even after five years, they can still trust him to do it right.",1
This book was a fun read.  There was a real twist at the end!  Loved it!,1
"The Other Boleyn Girl was a novel I looked forward to reading everyday in the same way I looked forward to savoring a dessert and coffee. Delicious!  It may not be historically accurate in every sense or have the cleverest prose but it doesn't claim to be a history book.  It is simply a well done story that happens to have some historical truth to it which does define historical fiction.  Phillipa Gregory has written a wonderful novel about the Boleyn family with Mary Boleyn as narrator. This gives the reader an inside look into the court of Henry the VIII and the culture of England in the 1500's.  It is profoundly interesting on both accounts. Gregory manages to create an atmosphere which allows the reader to feel as if they are there.  It is appalling to see that women are treated with little regard to their feelings and not much more than servants or sex objects.  It is shameful how the advancement of a family in the social ladder rested on the looks, and sexual prowess of the females in the family regardless of their own feelings.  Anne Boleyn in the novel is portrayed as a scheming, heartless, shrew who actually steals her own sisters baby so she may have a better chance at becoming queen.  Mary the narrator although portrayed as naive in most ways is jaded by her families need for power and control and is more or less controlled by them.  George the other sibling often quotes that it is not their lot in life to be happy but to do what they must for the family. How their lives play out is the meat of the story and is very well done.  Against the back drop of England in the 1500's, court intrigue, betrayal, lust, power plays and treachery, what more could a reader ask for?  Well done!",1
"I'm still not sure whether this is written for chidren and I got it by mistake or what. A fantastic story, so easy to read yet the descriptions are so vivid. The story comes alive and the scenes are so real. An amazing book.",1
"Yes it has its dark moments.  And yes it can be disturbing.  And that means the author did the job right.The book follows the life that was not an easy one and is not the perfect sunset of old age and conveys it all in the context of a world that most people do not know the in and outs about, the circus, but at the same time which is something we all have dreamed about.  If not dreamed about, at least were enamored with when we were young.As others said, I could not put this book down and lost a bit of sleep turning a few extra pages further in the evening.  But it was worth it.",1
It had my attention from the first page to the last.  Absolutely brilliant!  Could not put it down.,1
"Michael Tanner, a British philosopher, who has written about Nitzsche, offers an analysis of Wagner and his works. I do not recommend this book as an introductory biography of Wagner. Rather, Tanner discusses the controversy surrounding Wagner. He notes that Wagner's ""genuine anti-Semitism,"" womanizing, and both left wing and right wing politics would be forgiven if his critics didn't find something in his music to reinforce their hostility towards him. This observation encapsulizes the mystique surrounding Wagner. Just about everything about him, from his personal life, to his philosophy, to his music arouses passion.After analyzing Wagner in general, Tanner does an opera by opera review, concentrating on the meaning and philosophical underpinnings of each. This is no entry level plot summary; rather, Tanner dissects Wagner's works on a deeper level. In reading this book, it would be helpful if the reader was already familiar with Wagner's operas. Tanner covers Wagner's earlier operas which were fairly traditional with melodic area's and duets, and traces his evolution to the great musical dramatist that he became, culminating in the four opera Ring Cycle. If you seek to familiarize yourself with Wagner, this book is probably not for you. If you seek to gain an understanding of Wagner, this book is highly recommended.",1
"Enjoyed this collection of Wilde's short works. Very witty and really worth a read. Except perhaps for one, about the mystery lady.",1
This book tells of a man whose experiences as a young man are recalled when he's in his 90's. the writing is vivid and the experiences of the man when he's young and old are effectively told. My imagination was captured and I thoroughly enjoyed this book.,1
"We Can Build You, by Philip K. DickHaving read several works by Mr. Dick, I tend to consider myself a fan, though a hesitant one. His writing at the best of times is only perhaps slightly better than the norm, but what saves his works and turns them to masterpieces is that under the story is a foundation of solid granite; they are always based on magnificent though experiments, and it's difficult to read one without spending an exorbitant  amount of time afterwards just ruminating on what he's suggested.Unfortunately, this work is not one of his better. It's about a man named Louis Rosen who owns a company selling organs (the musical kind) across the country. Unfortunately, organ sales aren't what they used to be, and so his partner comes up with a new idea: create a bunch of simulacra and recreate the Civil War (though why one would want to recreate the Civil War is never really explained).So they create a couple of simulacra, one of which is Abraham Lincoln, and try to sell the idea to an investor. Rightly, he tells them that their idea is stupid. However, he does come up with another use for the simulacrum. And then the main character goes bat-shit crazy (sorry for the language, but I think it best conveys the confusion I felt while reading), both literally and figuratively; I had no idea what was going on and eventually he gets diagnosed with schizophrenia. And somehow gets ""cured"", though I have no idea how.I feel like the author was just trying to do way too much for this novel. He's got ruminations on the difference between man and animal, between machine and animal, between machine and man, between reality and fantasy, between medicine and music, and I'm probably forgetting some. He's just all over the place in this book. And while the first half of the book was pretty good, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone except perhaps the most hardcore Philip K. Dick fan. Go read one of his better known works instead.Memorable Quote:'I wonder how a spider feels when someone breaks its web to pieces.''It probably says ""drat"",' I said.'No,' Pris said solemnly. 'It gets furious and then it abandons hope. First it's sore -- it would sting you to death if it could get hold of you. And then this slow, awful blind despair creeps over it. It knows that even if it rebuilds, the same thing is going to happen again.''But spiders get right out there and rebuild.''They have to. It's inherited in them. That's why their lives are worse than ours; they can't give up and die -- they have to go on.'For more reviews like this, please visit[...]",1
"Amazing book, its a heavy read but you will not put it down. I don't want to spoil anything but I simply cannot wait for the next book.",1
"I couldn't put this down.  A wonderful story, with rich authentic detail.",1
"This is the second O'Brian I've read - planning to keep going in chronological order. Despite the title, the focus of the book is more on Stephen Maturin than Jack Aubrey. Aside from some rather obvious cribbing from ""Pride and Prejudice"" - maybe O'Brian was less comfortable imagining three-dimensional female characters than  males - I thought the characters were very well fleshed out. It's fun to see a bit of Maturin as secret agent in addition to his role as resident geek from the first book. One minor character I was glad to see back was Midshipman Babbington, no longer a ""child"", still quite adolescent but growing up.O'Brian does a great job of immersing the reader in the early 19th century - the language sounds plausibly archaic while still managing to convey plenty of personality and humour. While I can hardly keep up with all the nautical terms, I find myself accepting them and running with the story - it's like finding Elvish words in Tolkien. Modern military-techno thrillers (like the works of a certain former insurance agent) just aren't this rich.If I were to draw parallels between this book and another, it would be Showell Styles' ""Midshipman Quinn"", which takes place during the same period. It's obviously aimed at a younger audience and is therefore lighter, but also does a good job of bringing you into the 19th-century British Navy. Quinn is more of a geek-type like Maturin, actually.",1
"If you love these books you have to read this fifth book. If you've never read these before, then don't read this one first. If you are debating on whether to buy this one after reading the others in quick succession, I would suggest taking a break and returning to the series as I get a little bored with it when I read back to back",1
"I'd never read anything by Sarah Gruen before and I'd heard a lot of hype about this book due to the release of the movie. I decided to hold off watching the film until I'd had a chance to see for myself how the book was.I'm so glad I waited.This book had me from it's opening pages all the way to the close. The descriptions of life in a traveling circus were gritty and made me feel as if I were really on that train, traveling with Jacob, Walter, and Camel. Ms. Gruen's character developments were also incredible, and as a writer myself, I found myself wishing I had one iota of her talent for bringing them to life so vividly.The story is well paced, with just hints from the elder Jacob as to how his life turned out. I liked the transition from old voice to young and felt as if I could ""see"" the character both ways.All in all, a fantastic read!Nephilim",1
"Book 5 of the series.  There is not a cliffhanger ending but there are a lot of unanswered questions.  It has been a long time since A Dance with Dragons was published.  Book 6 is needed, HBO will be catching up id he does not get on it.",1
At this point I cannot stop reading this series because of the connection Martin is able to create between the reader and his characters but if he continues to dilute the story with new characters and plotlines I may have no choice.,1
"Just finished the throne-master's 5th installment of power.  Oh yes, winter is coming!  Dance with Dragons was filled with my favorite characters.  George never fails on coming up with original story lines.  Words are wind!  I can't wait until the HBO series comes out.  Very curious on how they will fuse the 4th and 5th book together for film.  Fans, you won't find out in this book who wins the game of thrones.  As usual, he leaves us all hanging.  Here are some of the storylines that I enjoyed.Danerys-Queen of the freed slaves is also Queen of Mereen.  She is in love with her captain, Daharis, but marries Hizdahr to enable a peace treaty.  Her dragons have grown into monsters.  One of them is loose and burning people to death.  The other two are caged in a pit inside of the pyramid/castle of the city.  The chains aren't holding up from their fire.The day after her wedding, Danerys attends a show that involves death fights.  Her dragon swoops in and ruins the event.  The show involves all kinds of perspectives, including Tyrion's, but when seen through her eyes it suggests that she is tired of her ""children""/dragons running amok.  She tries to discipline the monster with a whip which kind of works.  She mounts him like a horse and he flies away.  Everyone thinks she is dead, but she lives on an island with her dragon.  At the end of the book a tribe of Dothraki find her chowing down on a horse with her dragon.After Danerys marries Hizdahr, another man comes into her life, the prince of Dorne.  He wants to marry her and he, too, has ancestors from the Targaryen family.  She rejects him but he doesn't leave the city.  He refuses to believe that she is dead and then sets her dragons free, believing he can control them.  He ends up dead, but now there are three dragons on the loose.After Danerys leaves Mereen, her faithful servant, Ser Barristan (the guy Joffrey kicked out of the kingsguard back in season 1 or 2), investigates.  He suspects her husband was trying to kill her with honeyed-locusts.  The dragon ruined his plan.Tyrion-He snuck his way out of King's Landing after killing his father, Tywin Lannister.  He was helped by the bad eunuch, Visrys.  He embarks upon a trip to Dorne with another captive, Danerys's little brother who everyone thought had been murdered.  Tyrion's original travel companions die or get lost after a storm and he winds up in chains under Sir Jorah Mormont's supervision.  He and another dwarf are now part of a circus, headed for Mereen to entertain the lords.  He and the other dwarf entertain Queen Danerys and the city at the fight.  Sir Jorah is also part of the act.  Their lord, a rich man from Mereen, tries to kill them with a man-eating lion, but again the dragon scene ruins the plan.Reek/Theon-This is my favorite story line.  Theon was never one of my favorite characters but in this book he shines!  The Bastard of Bolton AKA Lord Ramsay takes Theon for a pet and tortures him nonstop.  The man psychologically looses his identity and takes on a new persona, the persona given to him by his master.  He is now Reek, the timid meek battered-wife syndrome PSTD prisoner who has forgotten most of his past.  He is made to live in a hole and eat rats. He is not allowed to bathe and often flayed for the entertainment of Lord Ramsay.  One day he is actually needed to play himself, Theon Greyjoy.  Lord Ramsay wants Winterfell so he marrys ""Arya"" Stark who of course is someone else.  He needs Reek/Theon to vauge for him and vouch for the girl's identity.  A big wedding is held at Winterfell and Theon, through plots and schemes of others, gets free.  This story reminds me of a Dracula-Renfield relationship.Circe-She had a much bigger story line in the 4th book, but nonetheless, George doesn't leave us hanging on her imprisonment of the septas.  For punishment she is made to walk across King's Landing naked.  Her head and beaver are shaved.  Townspeople throw things at her and make fun.  She does live, but will never have any respect as queen.  Her Uncle Kevan, the hand and king regent, is murdered by Visyrs, the bald eunuch.  Before Kevan Lannister dies, Visyrs tells him he is doing it for the Realm and Circe will of course blame the Tyrells.  Love the Machiavellian tactics!My Review:  There are so many new characters and new places.  The maps inside of the book were not helpful.  I couldn't find Meereen or Slaver's Bay.  The story has several moments of greatness, but too many pages in between.  This book has been the most difficult of the series for me to read.  The plot keeps getting bigger and bigger, reading much like a history book at times.  The characters' family trees have centuries of back stories that could have easily been condensed.  Personally, this story could be even more brilliant if 300-400 pages were edited out of it.  In the end, I love it.  For all of Martin's faults, it's the unique and revolutionary story that keeps me coming back for more.  His jaded themes of religion and politics resonate with me.  And love, well it's just a means to an end in this series.  The only halfway decent, moral character was Ned Stark.  Look what happened to him!  Nice guys finish last!  I will buy and read the next book and the book after that and the book after that-I'm hooked.  4/5 stars[...]",1
"I saw the movie before reading the book.. I taken enjoyed finding the similarities and the differences between the two.  I honestly can't say which I enjoyed better, but if you like one you will definitely be at least pleased with the other!",1
"I had read a great deal of reviews on here and as a result was apprehensive in buying the 5th book . After completing book 4 though I was like a rabid dog and needed my fix so decided to bite the bullet and give the 5th book a whirl.You should know that due to the severe negativity of all the reviews I went in with really poor expectations and quite possible could have enhanced my own pleasure of the book. That is, I was consistently and pleasantly surprised with the content of the book. I was even trying to figure out exactly why people were being so angry. Storywise, the book has a ton of heavy twists and small story-arcs. A lot happens to a lot of characters. Enough so that I was voraciously reading through and finished the book in half the time of the previous books.I think what really made people angry about this one though is that while a lot happens, very little comes in the way of moving toward the bigger underlying story arc of the book, which is the whole wights and their masters and what role the dragons will play, etc...I think this is ultimately what people are most annoyed about. The book was just as well written and in many ways better than the previous ones, but it lacks any real form of closure. It basically gives the reader the equivalent of ""literary blue balls"".That being said, i'm still lined up to read book 6 and greatly enjoyed the majority of this book and I think most fans of the previous book would to. Just go in knowing that you won't see much movement in the greater story arc.",1
"An OK story by Agatha Christie, not one of her best in my opinion. Nice read for a lazy summer day. As usual, Agatha Christie has an array of interesting characters and subtle plot twists. I do enjoy Hercule Poirot mysteries and this was one that I had not seen or read before!",1
"Stannis Baratheon marches on Winterfell from the Wall. Daenerys's empire is threatened from within. Tyrion finds himself enslaved. Cercei finds herself in chains. The Crow's Eye desires Daenerys for his own but so do several other would-be suitors. And Jon Snow faces dissent from his brothers of the Watch...In the latest installment of Incest and Intrigue, more of the pieces are placed on the board. Daenerys can't trust anyone. Jon Snow can't trust anyone. Iron Lords cannot trust their own brothers. Sellswords in general cannot be trusted. In short, no one can trust anyone while the Game of Thrones is being played.This one had its share of memorable moments, both good and ill. I really like how Arya's story is developing but I don't see how it's going to tie back into things. The revelation of Young Griff's true identity was a game changer and its repercussions will be felt in the next couple books. I liked that Brienne is still alive and that Jaime Lannister chose to follow her instead of rushing to Cercei's defense. Jon Snow getting knifed on the Wall by his sworn brothers didn't sit well with me. I'm really hoping he's still alive come next book, whenever that may be.It looks like Theon is headed for redemption but I'd rather see him dead or taking the black. Bran is progressing nicely. Whatever happened to Ricken and that bastard of Robert's that isn't Gendry? And who is Cercei's new champion Robert Strong, the Mountain, perhaps?I honestly don't think Martin will be able to wrap things up in two more books, not with all the balls he has in the air. Plus, it would be all too easy for him to throw more players into the mix to keep the saga going. Still, with A Song of Ice and Fire, George R.R. Martin has made an Oathbreaker out of me. I once swore I'd never get caught up in a neverending fantasy series. In fact, I believe I said I'd rather eat my own testicles. However, I'm pretty caught up in this one. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to join the tent city on George R.R. Martin's front lawn, to wail and gnash my teeth every night until the next book is ready.",1
"When my friend first mentioned I should read this book, I hesitated because of the subject of animal abuse. But I did read it and from the beginning was drawn in by the old man as he begins to tell his story. The story is so deeply sentimental and vivid in descriptives. The characters are unforgettable and this includes the animals. Yes it was painfully sad and I was angered when the abuse was occurring but still I read on. I must say this book made a big impression upon me as far as a story of adventure, travel, history and love all rolled into one. When I had my first book read for my debut novel on Friday, June 13th, 2008 the store manager (who took a chance on an unknown self-published author) predicted that my book, like ""Water for Elephants"", would have the same impact in time. She had said that Sar Gruen at first couldn't get the attention her book deserved but on went life to where WFE ended up being one of the most interesting accounts of US circus story ever told.  Although I saw no comparison with WFE and my novel, The Skye in June, I welcome her prediction and await the results. But! Buy WFE and like me, keep it in your library to reread in the years to come.",1
"I'm very sparing about 5 Star Reviews, but this book is worth every single one of them.Quite simply, this book captures the essence of the entire series, going beyond the first book in so many ways, and setting the tone and themes that the rest of the series explores in further depth.As other reviewers have noted, the character of Stephen Maturin is made the equal of Jack Aubrey in this book, but you are also introduced to:- Jack's ongoing troubles with Money- The Grapes Inn in the Savoy- Jack's relationships with Sophie and Diana- Stephen's relationships with the two ladies as well- Mrs. Williams and her petty prejudices and closed mind- Internal scheming at the admiralty for ships &amp; stations- Spying abroad on the French and Spanish- Duelling, honor and friendship- Daring escapes, near misses, close calls- The nature of Sailing, Gunnery and Seamanship- The natures of Indiamen, Privateers, and Warships- Humor, both subtle and broad- Reflections on the nature of soul, heart and mind- The requirments, priveleges and duties of command- Love sought, found, lost and rekindledFolks, it's truly a wonderful book, and wonderfully dense, able to bear many a re-reading.  Read it quickly for an adventure story.  Read it slowly for literature.  Read it at moderate pace for the humor.  There are so many shifts in tone, so many little vignettes, so many sparkling moments of dialogue that you just ~have~ to own it to appreciate it.I recommend you buy this and READ it.  If you have trouble getting through Master &amp; Commander, don't worry.  Put it down if you wish, and pick this one up immediately - I assure you, it's a great book.",1
"This book actually should be under one of Victoria Holt's other pen names, Jean Plaidy.  Plaidy writes about actual historical figures.The Queen's Confession is told by Marie Antoinette herself.  Well, not actually, but how she would have written it.  She grows up in the Austrian court under the guidance of her mother, the Empress Maria Therese.  She marries the Dauphin of France and deals with the &quot;uncrowned queen&quot;, Madame du Barry.  Finally, she becomes queen and started the beginning of the end of the French monarchy.  Scandal, intrigue, and flamboyancy were never as great, and the consequences are even greater.This book was wonderful!  I actually learned a lot about her (I thought I knew everything!).  Also, it is a good book to read if you are in for a good cry.",1
"Alistair Maclean's only western. Written with excellent pace, suspense created very early, and as always with the old master - the right combination of romance, tension and action, all on a train headed for a lonely fort somewhere in the wild west.",1
"The Mask of DimitriosCharles Latimer was a lecturer in political economy in England. In his mid-30s he began to write detective stories, and became successful enough to make a new career. While traveling abroad in Turkey he was introduced to the Chief of the Secret Police. Colonel Haki told him about finding a body, and Charles asked to visit the mortuary for the experience. Intrigued by the history of this Dimitrios, Charles decided to follow the trail and act as a detective. Dimitrios escaped Smyrna in August 1922 and went to Sofia, Belgrade, Paris, Lyons, and other places. The police knew of him, but can't prove anything. Then his body was found in Istanbul. Charles Latimer traveled to these places to try  to learn something. One unforeseen fact is that it is dangerous for a literary person to get involved with criminals; they don't appreciate the interest shown in them! But a Mr. Peters offered to help him in his research by referring him to a retired businessman in Geneva. Charles Latimer should have found a cause for alarm when told he had valuable information, but didn't know what it was! But he continued his journey without any fear.Chapter IX tells how a spy gained the friendship and confidence of a clerk in a government ministry. The clerk needed the money after he lost at a rigged card game. Peters told how he smuggled heroin to France in a coffin, but that couldn't be done regularly. The end of Chapter XI reveals the secret of Latimer's knowledge. [This is similar to Graham Greene's story ""The Third Man"".] Mr. Peters will profit from this knowledge. Their last meeting ends with rough justice. Charles Latimer decides to set his next mystery in an English country village. The ending seems unreal, forced by the need for Latimer's survival.",1
"I adored Water For Elephants when I read it the first time, but it was on my second reading that I realized the extreme skill Gruen exhibits on every page and in every scene. Her prose is crisp and exacting, and her characters are so vivid, they leap to life in this story that grabs hold of you and  doesn't let go. I was literally transported to another place in time. I can't recommend Water For Elephants highly enough. This book deserves all the praise it's received and then some. What a beautiful novel--a treasure for all who curl up with this gem!",1
"This is a good book that partially describes how the circus business operated during 1930's. Good plot, interesting emotional characters and lots' of historical information/anecdotes.The story is narrated by a very old person, I found some parts of his everyday life descriptions not so exciting. The narrative seemed like a novel approach though and I give the author credit for that.",1
Everything disintegrates in this one.  The story is all over the place.  Still it has more big moments than book four so I'll give it four stars.,1
"I found The Ninth Directive so delicious I read it slowly, a chapter at a time.I read the first book in the series, The Quiller Memorandum, years ago, and enjoyed it.  I won't wait so long to move on to the third book, The Striker Portfolio.It's great that this is back in print.  It ought to be an eBook as well.  Highly recommended.",1
"With A QUESTION OF UPBRINGING, published in 1950, the English novelist Anthony Powell began his ambitious 12-volume series ""A Dance to the Music of Time"", which follows the narrator and his social circle from the early 1920s until the early 1970s. As the novel opens an old man named Nicholas Jenkins reflects on Poussin's famous painting where four figures representing the Seasons dance to a lyre played by the personification of Time. A human life, muses Jenkins, is such a dance, with partners disappearing only to reappear at later times.Encouraged by this metaphor, Jenkins' reminisces begin with his school days in the early 1920s. Studying at an unnamed institution, probably Eton, Jenkins introduces his roommates Stringham, a melancholy soul from an aristocratic family, and Templer, scion of a businessman and a bit of a rebel. These three young men form a tight band and laugh at Widmerpool, a buffonish boy always on the margins of their society, but ambitious and intent on making a name for himself. The plot of A QUESTION OF UPBRINGING is rather simple, as Jenkins proceeds from school life to a summer abroad to learn French, and then into the university. Though the paths of all four main characters diverge after school, Jenkins meets up with his peers again at odd moments, until a rather dramatic separation marks the close of this first volume of the series.""A Dance to the Music of Time"" has been compared to Proust's ""In Search of Lost Time"" in its first-person narration and ambitious scope. To a degree, the comparison is fair. However, Jenkins is nowhere near as introspective as Proust's narrator. Although Jenkins often talks about how the events he recounts impacted his life, sometimes he seems to almost step out of the frame and dispassionately depict the events happening around him. Also, Powell adds a great deal of humour, although much of this is deadpan to an almost Edward Gorey degree and will not appeal to everyone.In fact, the aristocratic concerns of this series will put off a lot of readers. Powell has sometimes been attacked as a snob simply because he finds the lives of England's upper class to be a worthwhile setting for his series. But the decline of this world *is* an epic process and has within it a great deal of dramatic potential, even if we find these people's privilege odious. This decidedly middle class American reader enjoyed A QUESTION OF UPBRINGING very much. Jenkins' look back at his formative years has spurred me to consider my own. The novel is quite realistic in many ways (indeed, in later volumes there's an element of roman a clef about it). Powell's characters are universal archetypes -- we all know a Widmerpool or a Templer -- but they are never two-dimensional and have a convincing dimension to them.All twelve volumes of ""A Dance to the Music of Time"" have been reissued by University of Chicago Press in four handsome trade paperbacks. If you think you're going to go the distance, that's a better investment than older editions of the individual volumes.",1
"It was a pulling together of many threads running through &#34;The Game of Thrones&#34;. Some were clipped short, others hinted at games yet to come.

"Herman Wouk's book The Winds Of War is near perfect. The twelve years of research Mr. Wouk put into this book is a historical fiction lover's dream. He somehow manages to take a lot of dry information and turn it into fascinating, can't put down, reading. I came away from this book with a better and clearer understanding of WW2 than I have ever had before.The Henry family are the main characters of the story, with Captain Victor ""Pug"" Henry, a Naval Officer, as the head of it. None of the characters are really all that well fleshed out, there is just way to much going on in this story for there to be time to go too deep, but it all seems to work to make a very enjoyable and fascinating story that is hard to put down.This is definitely a ""can't put down"" book but I actually found myself taking my time to read it and savor it because I didn't want it to come to an end. This is a huge book (1056 pages) but I didn't find any part of it that dragged at all. I am so happy there is a sequel. Even after reading this 1000 plus page book I am ready to dive right into the second equally large book about the Henry family and the continuation of WW2.This is one of those special rare books that only comes along once in a long while...books you wish you could read again for the first time.",1

"In 'Without Remorse,' Tom Clancy tells us the background story of CIA legend Mr. Clark. Six months after the accidental death of his pregnant wife, John Kelly pulls over and picks up a young girl standing by the side of the road. Kelly falls in love with Pam as he helps nurse her back to help. Pam reveals that she was a teenage runaway that was made into a drug addict so that she would become a prostitute to make money for a group of drug dealers. Kelly wants to see who these people are and where they operate at, since he has friends on the police force in the city where Pam was a prostitute. As they are patrolling the neighborhood, they are spotted by the drug dealers. Kelly is shot and left for dead and Pam's body is found a few days later in a public park. Kelly decides to rid the city of the drug dealers his way - killing each of them with a different weapon so the police won't have a M.O. to go off of.",1
"A great book. The storyline was great, but lacked in description of the scenes. I couldn't imagine myself in the scenes very often. It was a great suspenseful book, though.",1
"This memoir reads as though you're eavesdropping on a winding, beer-fueled monologue at the local VFW, or whatever the British equivalent is.George MacDonald Fraser became an accomplished author in the post-war years, but began his adult life as an infantry man in Burma in the final six months of the Second World War.  He waited a full half-century before penning his reminiscences.  It is highly entertaining, a wonderful portal into common life in the British army, and all told with a curmudgeonly punch, reminding me of Dana Carvey's 1990s SNL character ""Grumpy Old Man"" (e.g. we marched uphill in the rain under constant mortar fire from the Japs...and we liked it!).For students of military history - or the Second World War, specifically - ""Quartered Safe Out Here"" has several things to offer.  First, it puts classic, narrative military campaign histories in perspective, with Fraser stressing that when you read ""X division encountered slight resistance"" it may have been the most eventful and terrifying experience of the entire war for some group of young men who engaged in that resistance.  It also shines a light on a forgotten front at a time when most were celebrating the defeat of Hitler and hardly gave the Japanese much thought, further demonstrating that all war experiences at the grunt-level is personal and intimate.  It occurred to me that Fraser would probably strongly endorse the arguments made by Jonathan Shay in ""Achilles in Vietnam,"" a penetrating look at small unit dynamics during extending close combat experience.Second, the author clearly wrote this book, in part at least, as a response to what he sees as contemporary revisionism on the war and specifically the feelings and motivations of those who fought it.  Fraser, for one, is unreconstructed - and proudly so.  Even fifty years after the fact, he still refers to the Japanese as ""Japs"" and candidly admits that he doesn't like sitting next them on airplanes and refuses to buy their cars.  Moreover, he feels no remorse or pity for anything the Japanese may have suffered during the 14th Army's roll through Burma, and that lack of war guilt extends to the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Fraser seems keen to leave this powerfully written testament for current and future academics to wrestle with the next time they want to reinterpret how ""the greatest generation"" got on during the horror of the Second World War.Finally, Fraser writes with rare skill and clarity, especially his ability to capture the tone and vernacular of his unit mates, nearly all of whom were Cumbrian (the author is Scottish and was thus known as ""Jock"" by the men).  I'm writing this review from southern Afghanistan where I'm serving mostly with British soldiers, so this aspect of the book resonated strongly with me.  In fact, I'm not sure I would have even been able to read MacDonald's phonetic spelling of the Cumbrian patois if I hadn't been immersed in a sea of working class British accents myself.Depending on your politics, this book may not be for you.  But if you love war memoirs, ""Quartered Safe Out Here"" is not to be missed.",1
"This is an amazingly beautiful book.  The writings are spiritual and absolutely beautiful.  They cover almost every aspect of life and provide inspiring, poetic and though-provoking words in answer to questions raised about them.  When my mother passed away, I read this book over and over again.  Many use the chapter on marriage as part of their wedding vows.  My daughter asked me to read that chapter to her and her husband as part of their wedding ceremony.  I cannot think of a better way to spend $10.00.  You will more than get your money's worth even if you only read one chapter in the book.",1
"I know my opinion does not seem to be shared by the masses, but I definitely do not feel that this book was one of James Patterson's best.  Even allowing for the extra description required to set up a character so that a series can be made out of him (i.e. Alex Cross), Patterson drags this story at best.I will admit that I read the first 250 or so pages VERY quickly, but all of a sudden the novel seemed to lose steam.  Combine this with the budding romance of Alex Cross that was focused on to the nth degree and did nothing to advance the plot and it made for a very difficult novel to complete.I made myself finish the novel because I was eager to get on to other Alex Cross novels that I knew received rave reviews.  I too do not like to read a series out of order so I forced myself through the remaining pages.  However, I found myself questioning whether or not ANY of the other Alex Cross books would be worth reading (they are, don't worry) during the course of this book.One last bit before I conclude, I was INCREDIBLY disturbed by the final chapters of this novel and I do not feel much of the description was necessary to get Patterson's view across.With all this being said, please do not use Spider as a judge for the other books in the Alex Cross series.  I have not come upon these issues again in any of the other Cross novels I have completed.  But, suffice it to say that it took a little while for Patterson to find a rhythm for his most famous leading man.",1
"Interesting book that does a good job of blending stories from the English and German sides of the fighting in North Africa.  We learn quite a bit about the planes the Brits flew, but less so about their German counterparts.  Like the way the stories of two officers, one a courageous, bright and adventuresome Brit, and the other a cool, erudite German major.  Story line is well developed, as are most of the characters.  The Italian doctor is very appealing, and steals part of the book.While we learn quite a bit about the Brits and Germans in North Africa, little of interest is provided about the role of Americans in the Cactus Air Force of North Africa.Overall, this a quick and enjoyable read.",1
I have become a fan of Alex Cross.  I enjoyed the way the mystery was solved.  I would recommend this book to any mystery lover.,1
"A prophet has waited twelve years in a coastal town for the ship that will bear him back to his homeland, which he misses.Why he is there, why he is waiting, how he knows what he knows, and who he is is a mystery.  As he departs the townspeople gather to wish him well. A local seeress who knows him best asks him to share his wisdom so that it will endure for generations to come.So, he reveals his wisdom on love, birth, marriage, children, pain, talking, pleasure, death any so much more.It is a profound work, and here is his advice on marriage so you may judge for yourself:You were born together, and together you shall be forevermore.You shall be together when white wings of death scatter your days.Aye, you shall be together even in the silent memory of God.But let there be spaces in your togetherness,And let the winds of the heavens dance between you.Love one another but make not a bond of love:Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.Fill each other's cup but drink not from one cup.Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf.Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone,Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music.Give your hearts, but not into each other's keeping.For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts.And stand together, yet not too near together:For the pillars of the temple stand apart,And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other's shadow.Its not a little similar to theTao Te Ching: A New English Version (Perennial Classics)where a border guard recognises Lao Tzu, and asks him to share his wisdom as he goes into exile.  Written 2,500 years ago, and one of the most translated books in the world.  The Tao contains many principles you can use in your everyday life, and if you're not thinking in  ego based ways, your wisdom based thinking opens up..If you like one book, you will love the other, so I recommend both.  For the Tao, I recommend the Stephen Mitchell version.  Hope this was useful.",1
"Prospective buyers will first note that this one, (like many Christie books) has been released under two different titles, ""There Is a Tide"" and ""Taken at the Flood,"" which is always very confusing for folks who are trying to acquire all the Agatha Christie books. Here, I'm reviewing the 1984 Berkley paperback which is the one I own. The work was originally published in 1948.The Cloades are a quiet family, aunts, uncles, nieces, and nephews... including a doctor, a lawyer, and a farmer. They all reside in their cocoon of a sleepy English hamlet dubbed Warmsley Vale; but their financial stability and all their futures are rendered to a shambles when the generous family millionaire, Gordon Cloade, dies suddenly during a German bombing of London, just after he had taken a youthful Irish bride (Rosaleen) and after having additionally neglected to write out a new will to meet his numerous pecuniary promises to his blood relations.Rosaleen and her disruptive and controlling brother settle in at the Warmsley Vale mansion alongside the numerous remaining Cloades who have every reason to wish the new Mrs. Gordon Cloade dead so that the estate would return to them under English law. Rosaleen's brother, David, enjoys the good life until an ominous man appears at the local inn and who may be Rosaleen's supposedly dead first husband. And so, here we have all the stereotypical ingredients for murder most foul! Murders do subsequently occur (no surprise there!) and the world's greatest detective, Mr. Hercule Poirot, involves himself in resolving the mystery. (I actually think that Doyle's Sherlock Holmes and Upfield's Inspector Napoleon Bonaparte were both better but this is the lofty title which Poirot confers upon himself.)Of her 80 or so books, (and I've read them all, most multiple times), this is one of Christie's best efforts. It has layers of atmosphere, colorful characters, and never-ending surprises. And while I think that her best work was her first one,The Mysterious Affair at Styles, this one is still very strong amongst all the mysteries ever written by anyone.It's 231 pages in paperback and I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.",1
"I found this very touching. A tale of adversity, melded with stoicism. It is neither pro- war or anti- war.  Just matter of fact- we had a job to do and we made the best of it.Strongly recommended",1
"I had only read The Old Man and The Sea before this novel. This book just grabbed me and I had to read it until I finished it. The trademark Hemingway style of silence is present here. The landscape and environment are as much a part of the story as the characters. It took getting used to pages of describing the landscape so deeply, but once I went along for the ride I enjoyed the novel immensely. The plot seems conventional, that's fine for me.",1
This has become a must read with so many favorable reviews I kept looking forward to being captured by it.  It really is two stories in one book.  The old man's story is wonderful.  My father resides in a residency care facility and the insights of the old man made me think about what my father is facing.  The loss of dignity and the battling soul struck home.In my view the main story was only fair.  The story seemed to be telegraphed and I could not get my self terribly interested.,1
"Khalil Gibran's book, The Prophet, has the power to transform the darkest feeling of pain in your heart into great release. What a blessing that it exists. Each passage touches on a deep and universal topic (marriage, friendship, etc).  The words, spoken profoundly and clearly from the mouth of the mystic and insightful prophet, who has nothing but words of wisdom to impart to those who gather around him, is a truly life affirming and transformative experience.  Please read this today. It will give you insight on the sacred aspects of all life choices and experiences that exist in the world.",1
"I almost decided not to review ""Dance"" as there are already so many reviews that express my feelings about the book better than I can express them, but here goes anyway:First of all, I really hate giving this book only 3 stars.  I so much wanted to love this book and I absolutely expected to give it 5.  I was glad to dance once again with my favorite characters as well as some fascinating new ones, but the music just didn't move me that much so the dances weren't all that exciting and didn't last that long.  I've waited 5 years with such great expectations but I'm afraid this book is a bit less than I expected considering all the hype and time that preceded it.  I still consider George Martin an astonishing writer, I still find all of the characters he creates superbly interesting and their journey well worth following, but the problem, from my point of view, is there was too little journey and way too much character.  I didn't review any of the previous books but if I had, I would give the first three 10 stars each.  I was absolutely enthralled, have read them each several times and hated to put them down for such mundane activities as eating and sleeping.  Altho I've also reread ""Feast"" I can only give it 3 stars as I found myself skipping through some POV's and yawning or getting up to do other things in the middle of a POV.  That's one of the main reasons I have waited so eagerly for Book #5.  I assumed it would redress the imbalance of ""Feast"" and take the story farther down the road.I'm not going to review the meat of the book as this has been done and redone already.  As has been said, there are copious descriptions (as only Martin can conceive) of food, landscapes, palaces, clothing, furniture, traveling, etc. and I actually enjoyed them as I am constantly amazed at his creativity...but only to a point.  After 500 pages, it began to drag on me and I felt the need for the beat of the music to accelerate.  I cannot critique what Martin is doing with the scope of the story.  This is his story and only he knows where he is taking it.  I have to trust that he knows what he is doing and that it will all come together spectacularly in the end, particularly considering what a great storyteller I consider him to be.  I just hope that the next books come sooner than 5 years apart.  Some of us may not be alive to finish it if he doesn't speed up.  I also hope he finds a REALLY GOOD EDITOR who is not afraid to slash and burn...I consider the editing of this book to be woefully inadequate.  I do, however, strongly recommend reading this book if you are as much of a fan of this series as I am...you must continue on the journey.George, I haven't given up on this story...in fact, when I read the last sentence in the Epilogue I HATED to close the book and leave Westeros, so please give us more and please, please, please start the music sooner rather than later.",1
"This is an immersive, addictive, intricately researched novel that transports the reader to dusty, hardscrabble depression-era US. Young Jacob Jankowski flees his veterinarian final exams at Cornell when he learns of his parents' accidental death. Faced with sudden poverty when the bank takes his parents' possessions, he starts walking with no destination in mind, and jumps a circus train in the middle of the night. The inner world of the circus unfolds around him as he learns of the class divide between the workers and performers, the fragility of the circus' desperate illusions, and the economic vulnerability of everyone on the show. He becomes the show's vet and befriends monkeys, tigers, horses, and one oppressed but ultimately triumphant elephant.Sara Gruen is a master of plot, building to a suspenseful climax and weaving together her storylines with tidbits and gems from her research on American circuses. She respectfully explores her characters' strengths and weaknesses, ultimately delivering an honest and intricate portrait of a difficult time in US history. This book was a 100% satisfying read.",1
"I picked up this book not knowing anything about the subject.  However, I was pleasantly surprised when I found that a veterinarian was the main character.  Very good book, kept me interested until the end.",1
"Ok,  Game of Throwns,  need I say more.  The interwining stories are wonderful and it is a series to get lost in.  I actually am enjoying this from a business perspective,  how to screw your way to the top and then get killed by your competition.",1
Much better than book 4  I can't wait for book six. Hurry up mr Martin you take too long and I want to know what happens to my favorite characters. Such twists and turns. Excellent.,1
"Well I gave this four stars because I love the series.  I had bought the other books for my father, who was 86 and didn't have HBO at his house so he didn't even know about the story.  He came to live with me while he was sick with colon cancer and he had decided against any treatment.  I had HBO Go on my IPad so I caught him up on the previous seasons he had missed.  The series was on hiatus at the time.  He loved it as I knew he would because he loved Sci Fi.  My father was an avid reader and his only complaint about the books wasn't really a negative; he said &#34;boy there are very strange names, so many families that it is hard to keep track of.&#34;  Knowing my father though it didn't take him long to sort it all out so when he would talk about the book he spoke of the characters by name.  His health deteriorated quickly but  he decided to buy this book any way.  I didn't know, and I'm sure he wasn't aware that he was ordering a hardcover book and that it would be so heavy.  Needless to say he couldn't hold the book up to read and as he was slipping away more each day I would try to read it to him but he was in and out of consciousness.  He said to me one day, &#34;I know I won't be able to finish this book&#34; and he was right he passed away shortly after.",1
I bought this book on the recommendation of my good friend and I absolutely fell in love with it. Sara Gruen is so articulate and a true story-teller. She weaves a mesmerizing tale of the magical and historical side of the behind the scenes of circus life. The deceit and downright meanness' gets transformed into this entertaining tale. The people and the elephant will linger in your memory long after you finish this story. A super read and I Highly recommend this novel.,1
"This is one of my favorite books of all time and I thought I would listen to it on a long trip, so I purchased the audio version through Audible.com.For Whom the Bell Tolls Publisher: Simon & Schuster Audio; Unabridged editionturned out to be a great investment and listening to the book refreshed my memories and gave me the feeling of experiencing the book again for the first time.I won't spend much time reviewing the book itself because nearly everything which can be said about it has already been said.  I can only add my voice to those praising the wonderful cadence of Hemingway's dialogue and the haunting, descriptive narrative as he works through how the politics of war have changed all his characters, reducing them to little more than animals living in caves, sometimes predators and sometimes prey.  Hemingway was sympathetic in real life to the Republican cause in the Spanish Civil War (against the Fascists), but he does not completely spare them in his portrayal of the levels of brutality men stoop to in a war pitting citizens of a single country against each other.  Hemingway also spares little sympathy on the ignorance and stupidity of some in command of the Republican Army, nor the callousness of those on the elite periphery, as preparations are made for the novel's pivotal moment.The narrative in the audio version is by Campbell Scott.  He is a very soft spoken performer who took some getting used to.  I imagined this novel would be read in a more forceful way, more like I imagined Hemingway himself might have read it, but Mr. Scott's voice is very measured and while heroic, virile male characters like the republican guerrilla fighters, characters like Pablo and El Sordo, may have been slightly underplayed, his careful narration allowed him to give depth to female characters, especially Pilar.I have listened to many audiobooks and one of the most annoying things can be male narrators trying to do female characters and completely blowing it.  A failure on this level can take you right out of the story and completely ruin the experience of listening to the book.  Mr. Scott avoids this and is able to voice the female characters without it sounding like a parody.  This is incredibly important with this book because the female characters are prominent and very strong. Another problem some narrators encounter is accents; again, a failure here ruins the book.  Mr. Scott never overplays any of the characters, giving each one of them credible distinctions without ever descending in stereotype.When I had finished listening to the book I realized that Mr. Scott, by achieving this balance with supporting characters, had given nearly perfect voice to the measured, methodical and logical voice of American Robert Jordon, the main character.  Since much of the book is introspective reflection and dialogue by Jordon, Mr. Scott's narrative style was, for me, the perfect fit.All in all, I highly recommend both this book and this audio version.  If you are not a reader or don't see yourself ever being able to attack this long book, try the audio version.  You will be carried away to the treacherous gray, stony mountains north of Madrid by an author who knew not only how to live but also how to die.",1
"It's now part of literary legend that J.K. Rowling wrote the final chapter of the final book of her beloved Harry Potter series well before she wrote even half the novels.  She knew how the story was going to end, and she said that allowed her to keep a tight rein on the characters, and resist the temptation to let the series spin out of control.One wonders how Patrick O'Brian was able to keep his beloved characters, ""Lucky Jack"" Aubrey and Dr. Stephen Maturin, under such control over a series almost three times as long as Rowling's.  ""The Mauritius Command"" is the fourth book in this amazing series, and O'Brian shows a deft command over both his subject matter and his characters.  Often, by the fourth book in a series, the characters start to grow dull.  Not only does the reader get the sense of retrodding the same ground, the author has to somehow overcome the sense that his characters are invincible.O'Brian avoids both of these pratfalls with apparent ease.  ""Lucky Jack"" may be lucky at sea, but he finds new and innovative ways of getting in trouble on land.  Now, not only is he ashore with no ship and on half-pay, he must contend with his recently destitute mother-in-law and a brace of twins - girls, no less.  Dr. Maturin arrives with the promise of a command and a daring mission - to take two French-controlled islands off Madagascar.  Soon Aubrey is at the helm of a ship, but in addition to his usual cares and concerns, he must now cope with being a Commodore, commander over several ships, including several whose captains carry several tragic flaws.  These various scenarios allow Aubrey to experience fresh troubles with which he has no actual experience, and wonder whether his old tactics will see him through.Dr. Maturin continues to grow as a character, as well as in practical significance to the storyline.  In ""Master and Commander,"" he was basically a bystander, an observer of the naval action around him.  Now, his role as an intelligence man (read, spy) becomes more important as he plays a vital role in helping the British governor assume his station . . . including playing a game of propaganda warfare against the French.  Maturin also gets a few chances to practice his amazing surgical skills, breaks a few bones, and is confronted with his ""dedication"" to opium.Not quite as funny as previous books (no drunken sloths to be seen), but with a little more action, ""The Mauritius Command"" is a defining book in this series.  Even though this book, according to some, can be read out of sequence, I disagree since Aubrey's (temporary) promotion to Commodore falls in line with the other books.",1
"Wow! Sara Gruen is a master storyteller. Her words make the often seedy yet oh-so-fascinating world behind the scenes of a legendary circus train seem so real, so here and now. The central figure of Jacob Jankowski is so well written. I am especially taken with the depiction of life in a nursing home with the body of a 93-year-old and the wit and mind of a much much younger man. It gave me a whole new perspective on how sad and depressing life must be like in an institution like that and will make me spend more time getting to know those who find their homes in such a place. But what struck me most was when I read the Afterward in which Ms. Gruen explained the motivation for writing this novel and the incredibly detailed research that she found herself doing just to put pen to paper. Not only is she so very gifted with the ease of writing, but she is very committed to the realism of details. Incredible! She took some really fascinating true stories from some of this country's most storied circuses and rolled them all into one incredible journey. I highly recommed this book to everyone I meet and I will be looking for more of her works to inspire and inform. Do yourself a favor and pick up this book today.",1
"At my age and considering how slow Martin is, I may not see the end of this series because he's older then I am.I'm reading the whole series. This whole series is great, but Martin needs to write faster. There are so many characters and the plot is so complex its hard to keep track of everyone.At the third book I had to go back and reread one and two because of the time that had gone by. At that time I thought there was only to be three books.",1
"I've read all of these but never viewed the TV series. A great story with interesting characters even if all the good guys keep getting killed. Dany needs to get her butt in gear, tame her dragons & win the 7 kingdoms back. Need to hurry up get a move on with the story telling before people loose interest. Too many words used to describe minor details.",1
"During a walk one day in Moscow, NYC-born twenty-two-year old employee of the American Embassy in Moscow, Alexander Dolgun, was kidnapped and taken to ""the Lubyanka prison, headquarters of the MGB."" Initially, thinking what a great tale he'd have to tell (having seen the inside of such a famous place), knowing he hadn't committed a crime, he was unafraid, maybe even a little bit...excited. But it wasn't long before he was imprisoned, interrogated, tortured, and sentenced under (p 19) ""Article 58, sections 6, 8, 10, etc. of the Soviet Criminal Code...espionage, political terrorism, anti-Soviet propaganda, etc., etc."" to imprisonment in a forced labor camp. By the time of the ""thaw,"" when many prisoners were released including Dolgun, he had spent eight year of his life in forced labor camps. Twenty-three long years passed from the day of his kidnapping until he was able to again set foot on American soil. After his release from prison, he met Solzhenitsyn, who interviewed him while writing The Gulag Archipelago. He was especially interested in Dolgun because (p 348) ""he had never...met a sane survivor of Sukhanovka."" Like Solzhenitsyn, Dolgun had an amazing memory and was able to recall minute details of much of his imprisonment. Forced to stay up for days at a time with little or no sleep during his interrogation sessions, he was beaten, sent to solitary confinement, and tortured for not signing a document stating that he had committed illegal acts. He proudly writes of his ability to survive without signing anything incriminating anyone else (although some of his acquaintances did succumbed to the pressure). When he finally was released, he found out that his mother, also picked up, tortured, and imprisoned, went mad due to her experience. Not long after their reunion, she was sent to a psychiatric hospital with the diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. She remained there for the rest of her life. There were very few Americans in the GULAG. At times, he was able to use that fact to his advantage, although others were wary of him, believing he must have been a spy.He recounts the experience of being transported to and between prisons, interactions and friendships with other prisoners, the day to day drudgery of trying to stay alive under horrendous conditions which involved trying to meet ridiculously high work quotas for extremely strenuous jobs while in a constant state of starvation and often, sickness. Fortunately, he was able to work in the prison hospital at times as a feldsher (even performing minor surgery). He also did his share of hard labor, but was ingenious enough to get extra food by secretly doing sideline work like by making metal spoons. Dolgun's story is one of many wonderfully tragic memoirs about an often-overlooked issue: Stalin's forced labor camps. Also good: Journey into the Whirlwind by Eugenia Semyonovna Ginzburg, Man is Wolf to Man by Janusz Bardach, One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich (partially based on the experiences of Dolgun's friend, George Tenno) and The Gulag Archipelago by Alexander Solzhenitsyn, and, probably my favorite, Kolyma Tales by Varlam Shalomov.",1
"I had looked forward to reading this book after listening to the audio book version of Daughters if Fire which I found fascinating.  This was unfortunate because by comparison, Lady of Hay felt repetitive albeit written many years before, and therefore if read in  chronological order maybe Daughters of Fire would have been slightly less enthralling.I was impressed by the depth of historical research in the books, the attention to detail and insight into the characters both ancient and modern.  I felt I was observing joy and despair; feasts in the great Hall and the loneliness of cold dark castles; the change of seasons and fortunes.Lady of Hay is a good holiday read for those who enjoy 'big fat' novels and have a Kindle.",1
"Seven hundred pages of fine print, and another hundred of footnotes (in 2010's revised edition) narrate thousands of years over which people have longed for the right to make their own decisions, live as best they choose among each others' mutual assistance and communal support, and to conduct their livelihoods and relationships as they please, free of coercion, top-down dominance, or imposed government or creed. If leaders are chosen, if organizations are established, then these are entered freely and exited at will.This sums up anarchism's principled versions. It seems from early on, philosophers, priests, bosses, legislators, politicians, and generals all have feared such a movement. Peter Marshall's immense survey shows the results, parading steadily the greatest names in the centuries who've tried to make theory into practice. The Introduction begins with great quotes from some of its exponents, and prefaces in Part I anarchism as it is in theory. While &#34;the river of anarchy&#34; changes with each version, the essence of freedom attracts a few each generation to plunge into what, by the heady rhetoric recurring, appear inviting waters of liberation, personally and socially. For, society for most advocates remains, even if the State withers away. The former is sought freely; the latter isn't chosen. &#34;Society and the State&#34; and &#34;Freedom and Equality&#34; articulate this in Marshall's introduction.In Part II, the forerunners of anarchism, Taoism and Buddhism, surprisingly show how ancient this impulse is. Feared by Plato if somewhat anticipated by the pre-Socratic Greeks, its impulses survived into early and medieval Christianity, among such as dissenters, heretics, guilds, and rebels against Rome--and against Luther, tellingly. By the English Revolution, we see the short rise of Levellers and Diggers, and the brief establishment of Gerard Winstanley's commune--and then his about-face later in life, as he turned away from his earlier rebellious stance. Inconsistency, as Marshall patiently notes, characterizes many who in the French Renaissance and Enlightenment and also, as with Burke in the British Enlightenment, toyed with models for radical change without truly supporting them.By Part III, French, German, British, and American libertarians emerge. Not quite anarchist for the term was not yet in common usage, but such as Tom Paine presage if imperfectly, for many sought the protection of a Jeffersonian State, however limited, along a federalist or decentralized system, the dreams of the later 18th century, as revolution sparked the possibility for change and no more kings. Partial anarchists, as it were, abound among Rousseau, Emerson, Swift, Mill, Morris, or Fourier, et al.In Part IV, we finally reach the heart of the book. Classic anarchist thinkers begin with the passionate example of William Godwin, the lover of order. Next comes the near-Nietzschian Max Stirner, the conscious egoist, who as many would angered Marx. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's intricate theories reveal the philosopher of poverty. Two Russians pair off: Michael Bakunin as the fanatic of freedom, full of inconsistencies as many theorists seem to be in this century. Peter Kropotkin, the revolutionary evolutionist, tries to tame the theories with a study of geography and science to fit anarchism within a natural determinism, akin to many world-changing paradigms of the nineteenth century. So does, on a smaller scale, the fierce Elise&#769;e Reclus: the geographer of liberty. For all but Reclus in this long part, Marshall offers a grand sweep of their life and thought before entering topics such as their ethical views, political attitudes, thoughts on the State or human nature, to clarify particular ideas in depth.The twentieth century's Errico Malatesta, the electrician of revolution, sparks a new current: the energy of the will, not of nature, as a way to transform human drives towards peaceful (again a contentious point among many, as the fall of the Paris Commune and the rise of WWI split many) goals. Marshall seems to sympathize with those who reject war or violence, as these are coercive means to achieve the end of the end of class antagonism, national boundaries, and capitalist rule.Leo Tolstoy, the count of peace, gets sympathetic treatment, and various American individualists and anti-State Communists such as Lysander Spooner (who finally takes on a question I'd been waiting for ever since I read Locke to ask: who signed us up to the social contract established by the &#34;consent of the governed&#34; centuries ago?), Voltairine de Cleyre, Benjamin Tucker, and Alexander Berkman but they're all skimmed over too hastily, in admittedly a very lengthy book as it is. Sasha B's companion,Emma Goldman as &#34;the most dangerous woman&#34; earns a brisk, lively study, as Marshall scans her ambiguous position between understanding and condoning the use of violence to achieve liberation.German Communists, notably the brave martyr to the cause in the aftermath of 1919's failed Munich soviet, Gustav Landauer, follow suit, and then Mohandas Gandhi, who counters brutality as &#34;the gentle revolutionary&#34;; a strength of Marshall's treatment is that he firmly if gently calls out Gandhi for devolving from leader to guru with a cult of personality, or chides in part V, &#34;Anarchism in action,&#34; those in France, Italy, and Spain who capitulated to compromise, as with the CNT-FAI, and so lost the momentum of the social revolution, during Spain's war against fascism--and Stalinism. Still, then as now, some accommodation with party politics appears inevitable for many radicals, to advance situations amenable to elusive goals of autonomy and mutual aid beyond unions or regions.Russia and the Ukraine, with Makhno's early attempt, similar to Spain's at a sustained anarchist society during war, offer cautionary tales, as do repeated situations in Northern Europe, the United States, and especially Latin America, when attempts at progress were stymied by unions, violence, agitation, and crackdowns. Mexico and Cuba repeat the same story as the USSR and Spain, where anti-statist traditions were lured or pressed into capitulation by crafty cadres led by brutal despots.While these chapters inevitably and rather dully in parts tell some of the same narrative the earlier chapters on leading anarchists had, depending on the nation, glimpses at such movements as French Situationists, British punks, American Wobblies, and German agitators show how the 20c managed in a few nations to survive its heyday 1880-1930 and a few progressives lived long enough to see the 1960s and inspire younger activists. The downside of this in India, where the Sarvodaya movement was co-opted by a very clever politician who used it for his own party advancement, is also telling.After a hasty look at Asia (many regions get a rapid glance, and this tends to be names-and-dates and unions-full-of-initials types of coverage, of uneven interest compared to earlier biographical narrative), Marshall shifts in part VI to modern anarchism, with the New Left and the counterculture. This lively section looks at Situationists, Kabouters, Provos, and Greens along with anarchists themselves, as by the 1960s, a loose collective rather than unions or platforms drives many experiments. One of these, concocted on the New Right as anarcho-capitalism, merits blunt critique.Modern libertarians and anarchists gain briefer mention; Murray Bookchin and his ecology of freedom meets an in-depth challenge as Marshall takes on this former and then future Marxist who bridled at the &#34;lifestyle&#34; rather than &#34;social&#34; anarchists as insufficiently committed. Marshall's passion emerges here and makes this part of the book lively and spirited. Similarly, his reprise as Part VII of the book's contents, as he reviews the big thinkers who established the legacy of anarchism, its ends and means, and the relevance of anarchism, along with an epilogue, shows how difficult it is for the author to let go of this vast topic. He examines the strengths and weaknesses, he tackles the applicability of this ideal to our &#34;post-scarcity&#34; economy after the heady utopian dreams of the 60s have given way to environmental damage, job loss, unfettered capitalism, and a commodity culture.Again, in the last sections there is some repetition, and certain material gets included a third time, for overlap of thinkers, regions, and recent events may be inevitable. A history of a big idea causes the weight of a big book. But anyone who's read shorter works such as Colin Ward's Anarchy: A Very Short Introduction or the newer A Living Spirit of Revolt by Ziga Vodovnik (both reviewed by me in May 2014 here) will welcome Marshall.P.S. This massive work might be read on a Kindle so note-taking can be eased. As the print copy and bulk necessitate a very small font, readers may prefer a dual version. I found the index and notes easier to consult in book fashion, but the highlighting made an e-book appealing. A few typos remained, and the margins of a Kindle version meant that 40% of the text was end-material, but the portability of this meant I could finally finish what I'd been making my way through in print, slowly...",1
"I'm from Mexico and my wife is not; we recently got this book after  a trip there where she fell in love with the cuisine. The book contains authentic recipes, many resembling my abuela's cooking, and are accessible to anyone who understands English. Beautiful pictures are the icing on the cake. Enjoy it as much as we have.  Buen provecho!",1
"Every country in the world has crime cases that rock the very fabric of their society, their values, their very humanness.  ""The Holocaust"" covers a period of many years before, during and after WW2 when a ""civilized"" nation undertook deeds of humiliation, degradation, terror, torture and murder of European Jewry with such impunity that totally defies human comprehension.  This is not an easy book to read, the horrors that spring from virtually every paragraph will challenge every notion of the human race been filled with kindness and goodwill.  Of the many thousands that shed blood in the villages of Poland and Russia, there were millions that looked away as their neighbors and former friends were taken into killing fields or bundled into trucks and trains to death camps.  One and a half million children ... what mind can wrap itself around swinging a baby and smashing its head against a wall, or putting a bullet through a child, or in fun compete in contests of how many people one bullet could kill?  In the killing fields or burning snynagues of Russia, the ghettos of Poland, the days of cattle-cart transports to the camps of Treblinka and Auschwitz-Birkenau, survival required miracles.  Be warned you are going to require frequent respites from reading the horror of a culture and religion under commissioned terrorization, torture, enforced abject starvation and blatant murder.  Most likely this was humanities darkest years; it makes the Spanish Inquisition read like a teddy-bears' picnic.",1
"This wasn't a long read. I finished this up in a day, but really liked it.  It was just spooky enough to hold my attention without being super creepy.  I liked the way things were described and Robert's confusion at everyone's irrational behavior.  This reminded me of the feeling I get from episodes of the Twilight Zone or Outer Limits.  Nicely Done.",1
"There are no words to describe the Evils written about in this book. But the words Martin Gilbert has do describe with historical precision the destruction of the Jews of Europe by the Nazis and their various allies. The book is difficult and painful to read because of the horrible stories it tells. And as one reviewer on Amazon has said this is a record not of one crime but of thousands of crimes done every day, not of one cruelty but of millions of cruelties. One of the features of this historical accounting which may seem to some to disturb the flow of the overall historical narrative but which to me seemed to give tremendous weight and power of the book is the account of individual lives, the stories of those people who actually suffered and went through the Shoah. Naming of names in this way, and telling the stories of the ' little people' seems to me to give the account a human strength that more general accounts lack.This work is as I said very difficult to read because of its painful subject matter. Reading it one certainly learns about ' man's inhumanity to man' the cruelty Mankind is capable of. One learns to know how certain specific peoples seem to display special tendencies for that cruelty. One learns about the worst chapter in all of Jewish history , and of the surviving remnant of it.Who wishes to know and understand the full character of human history must read this book, or one like it.G-d help us all.",1
Wonderful book.  It kept my attention through the entire book.  I did wish there had been more on their life together later.,1
"I have been reading some discussion forums concerning the quality of the higher rating from this book, so I'm going to try and walk the fine line between answering the complaints about the book, telling you why I liked it and not giving away every freakin' detail in the book. Its long, can't be helped, try to keep up.1. ""The book it too long and isn't fast enough paced"": what did you expect? Its about a major war covering an entire continent. For those who compared it to the length of the Lord of the Rings, that story involved like nine people and Tolkien could get pretty wordy. This book involves HUNDREDS of people, even when you aren't hearing their voices. And wars take time, especially in medieval Europe. Most battles in this type of setting ended one of two ways, either you killed the leader, in which case everyone gave up (hence the importance of banners so people knew when to quit), or they were incredibly long sieges which usually only ended once one side or the other had been starved into submission. In which case, most of the war was waiting.2. ""Are we there yet?"": Again, what do you expect? In order to get to point B from point A, you have to journey. These journeys often don't do smoothly and there are often side trips. Like the Tom Bombadil story (again for those who like to compare GRRM to Tolkien). These journeys should NOT be skipped however, because it is in these moments that characters stop, reflect, think and GROW. Yes, battles are more interesting and energizing, but how many deep thoughts can a character have while in battle? For that matter, how many battles can they have before it just gets foolish? It is this ""I want it NOW"" action-crazed audience that led ""7 Samurai"" from being a fabulous, 208 minute movie into ""The Magnificent 7"" which was a tacky western of half the length and then onto a bad TV show that didn't make three seasons. Most people couldn't sit through the team actually getting put together and journeying together because they thought it should have been done in a musical montage or something3. ""He should have/his editor should have/if he'd only cut..."": Oh shut up. If you don't like it because its too long, tell us you thought it was too long and don't read the next one. Even better, get out of the backseat yourself and prove you can drive. Go write 5k words and listen to everyone tell YOU that you took too long, they didn't like how you took the story and they could have done better.So why DID I like it? I'll be honest, in places I didn't. Daenerys annoys me. There are too many bleeping characters and I have trouble with names. My geography is too bad to keep track of where everyone is even with the maps. Hence, four stars, not five. HOWEVER, Daenerys annoys me, despite the fact that she is supposed to be one we are rooting for. WOW! A book where I don't have to like the good guy! More like ""Thomas Covenant"" than the Hobbit! Reek was horrible but...ooo...now I kinda feel bad for him.  Still wish he'd die, but now out of pity. The Dwarf is the BOMB! He's witty, boinks hot chicks, runs circles around his siblings, tamed wild men and has great taste in wine.  But hey, now he's kinda useless for everything but pig riding. Which bring us to the end point. This is the ONLY series I have ever read where ALL the characters are imperfect, three dimensional, subject to change and prone to sudden death syndrome. And wasn't that what grabbed us in the first book? Ned's death? The sudden DIFFERENCE of it all? Not every book can have that ""reach out and grab you by the throat"" attitude. Like the battles, its gotta calm down sometime. In this case, the difference, and the growth are slower and more subtle. To expect everyone to change overnight in a flash of inspiration is ridiculous.And maybe I'm wrong. Maybe he is a ""paid by the word"" guy. Maybe he's just lost it. Who knows. The answer is I DON'T. If you don't like the book, fine. I do. But don't act like you have a clue where the series is going or what the author is thinking, because you don't. And neither do I, so I'm gonna keep reading.For those who want to judge the quality of my review, have at.  I am NOT a writer and don't pretend to know how to write prose. If I did I'd be too busy spending the next five years trying to come up with a story to top my LAST book, all the while knowing that if I have a slow spot in the tale I'm gonna be crucified. Why is it taking so long for GRRM to write these books? Probably because the stress to stay perfect is giving him writer's block!",1
"I decided to read this book because of the movie coming out in April. Well, what a wonderful discovery! This book sucked me in from the first page. I could not put it down. I highly recommend reading this book if you are considering seeing the movie in April.",1
"This is a great horror novel, from beginning to end. A truck driver, unknown to him, gets marked and will be killed by a demon in three days unless he can find a way to reverse the curse placed upon him. Absolutely scary, especially the ending when the demon faces the main character. What a great talent from Muriel Gray.",1
"For one who would prefer Truth coming from a source other than the King James Version, ""The Prophet"" is written with the voice of wisdom and the beauty of poetry. If there is a Black and White 'Truth,' one could easily seek it here in almost all the verses.",1
"This book can be pretty graphic for younger kids.  I was a little surprised when I read it.  Our oldest was 12 when she finished it, her teacher had recommended it.  I talked to my d about it and she was fine, many things depend on the maturity of the child.  It is a very good story and I cried during the movie.",1
"This is my favorite Clancy book - and edging out the Hunt for Red October isn't easy.  This is a thick book, yet you will get through it quickly because it is so interesting.  It has the most character development of any book.  Rainbox 6 follows this, so you should read Without Remorse before Rainbow 6.  Note, there are fairly descriptive scenes - torturing a man with a pressure tank, young women forced into rough sex (pliers on parts of the body, etc.).  But without villians you can't have a hero.",1
I chose that rating because James Patterson is a great writer. I like it because Alex Cross is a very smart and decated detective. Yes i would recomend these books to friends and family,1
"I dearly love epic fantasy. But. After slogging through some of the mire of words, endless words, and plot threads and new characters (who are these people?) this eagerly-waited-for edition disgorged, I started getting impatient, and hopping through the book, forlornly searching for any crumbs about the characters I had come to care about. The more I tried to read, the more I was forcibly reminded of the frequently hysterical remarks posted at Amazon about the later works of Robert Jordan (people mess with their hair, and walk around, and think about stuff, and nothing happens!)Well, stuff happens in DWD, most of it swathed in meandering plot lines that go here and there. Every now and then I was able to extract an entertaining nugget, but mostly I was bored, or irritated. I think this is Martin's revenge on all of us who fell in love with this series and harassed him to finish the book, George.  And yes, it's dark, and just plain lurid in parts, with little relief.  Reminds me of a 60 Minutes episode on a modern art, where a line of urinals and a pile of candy was considered ""art"". Or the painting that said ""RAT, RAT, RAT"" that sold for $30,000, I think. Too bad Martin IS a terrific writer, too bad I'll shell out for the next installment because I can't stand not to.  Rats, rats, rats.  It breaks my heart because I, like so many others, had waited for this volume for so long.I give it 3 stars because even this bloated meandering mass of spaghetti is better written than most of the fantasy out there - kudos to anyone who can read this word by word, but I thought James Joyce pulled a fast one on everyone, too.",1
"Ever since I first heard of the unthinkable,horrific death of Matilda De Braose and her oldest son , I've felt a sympathetic fascination towards her so when I remembered I had this book in my possession I was eager to read it.Mrs. Erskine does a brilliant job at bringing a woman and her family who have been dead for over 800 years to life as well as painting a vivid portrait of not only the world they lived in, but the daily realities of that world .The story is engrossing and well researched as far as I can tell (although my knowledge of English history is still very rudimentary).However, the book is also entirely too long.It took me about 5 days to read it and at times, the narrative dragged and became very repetitive and I found myself wishing that I could just get to the end.As tragic and gripping as Matilda and her son's death scene and other passages was , I sighed in relief when I came to the last page.I feel the story would have been better told if the book was about 200 pages shorter.As a last positive note,I'm very glad that this book was written because I feel that it exposes Matilda and her story/horrific fate/ to a large and continuing audience that would likely never hear of her otherwise.Lord knows that a woman and her son being thrown into a dungeon and starved to death on the direct and deliberate orders of a monstrously cruel King should never be forgotten.The suffering of both , both physically and mentally, before death finally came must have been unbelievable.PS- To any history buffs- while this book is based on real people and events and is basically accurate, one should be aware that there are events that by the author's own admission never occurred , such as Matilda's great love affair with a handsome,dashing nobleman(who also really existed), others are the pure speculation such as Matilda's rape by the same king that would later order her death- King John.If using such devices to ""spice up a story"" and speculation about real people and events irks you then you should definitely stay clear.",1
"I was really eager to read this book after seeing all the great reviews for it.  However,  I started reading it and could not get into it.  The whole first half dragged for me, with not too much going on in the story. The writing was difficult to read at times, and I agree with some of the reviewers here, it often read as a screenplay which made it that much harder to get into.  But about halfway through the book, the plot starts moving and I actually end up finishing the book and I'm glad I did.  I'm still not sure why the book itself is getting rave reviews, but I am looking forward to seeing how the movie version of the book will turn out.",1
"I am not usually a literature guy (preferring non-fiction and popular novels), but I read this because it is a classic and I wanted to experience Hemingway beyond my high school reading of ""The Old Man and the Sea."" (and honestly, because while dating my wife she revealed this as one of her favorite books and that aroused my curiosity.)This is a story that deals with the larger questions of life (and essential truths) and man's place in the world or at least in a challenging situation.  So that qualifies as literature according to my wife's definition when I asked her what made literature ""literature"" a while ago.Protagonist Robert Jordan is an American volunteering with the Republicans fighting Franco's Fascists in the Spanish Civil War.  A demolitions expert, Jordan's task is to blow a key bridge as part of a larger Republican attack.  While waiting with a small band of guerilla's he meets and falls in love with Maria, a victim of the war and symbol for all innocents caught in aggression's path.Thus we have a literary work that addresses commitment to cause, love, and the battle between individual wants and the needs of and obligations to a larger cause.Hemmingway has a way with description and his prose is very well done and evocative - particularly one passage I liked when he described holding Maria's hand with ripening grain in an untrammeled field.  His story is slow, however, for my tastes and the descriptions and inner conversations of Jordan are much more prevalent than scenes where anything called action could be said to be occurring (though the action scenes are pretty good when they do occur).  I imagine the ending will be unsatisfying to some, but for literary minded folks be the source of discussion as to how the final scene may have played out and what it meant in terms of tying the story's themes together.",1
"When does a strength become a weakness? I read the first three books of the series awed by the author's ability to kill characters who I thought were pretty central to the story and also create new and exciting characters. However, in book four and five I am not sure if it works so well. (spoiler alert) I think the problem is that the story does not move. Characters like dannerys agonize over their decisions for virtually the whole book.Of course I will read the next book when it comes out but I do hope that George Martin moves the stories forward. Not necessarily towards a conclusion but forward.",1
"Hemingway used his experiences as a journalist during the Spanish Civil War to build the structure for this novel.  His descriptions of the settings are superb. The novel is a great introduction to the Spanish Civil  War, a war with which many Americans are unfamiliar. Hemingway used  characters like Pablo to show how people lose their humanity during war.  The story is powerful.  His main character, Robert Jordan, begins to  question whether anything good will come of all the fighting.Despite its  many wonderful attributes, this novel has some problems.  The dialogue is  stilted.  The romance (as in all Hemingway novels) is unbelievable.  Finally, Hemingway should have stuck to English.  His use of Spanish in  this book is embarassing.Nonetheless, in my opinion, For Whom the Bell  Tolls should be required reading for all U.S. high school students.  It's  truly a classic.",1
"This will be short and sweet. I'm normally and action story reader, biographies, business literature and everything by Cormack McCarthy. This is far from the type of book I would give a read. I gave this a try because it was an inexpensive Kindle best seller and loved it. Great love story, circus story and character development. The best part is the happing ending.If you have read Cormack McCarthy you know you need a happy ending from time to time.",1
"Continued saga. However, just wish they would have combined the 2 threads and made two books out of it...having trouble keeping up.",1
"College guy joins a travel by train circus and flips over the beautiful star married to a jealous, sadistic husband.  The first person point of view makes his crushing on her vivid.The author's historical research adds fascinating info.  She does not hold back on the sex or violence.  The characters are outsized; good idea for a circus story.This is one of the most entertaining novels I've ever read.",1
"Between 1988 and 1996, over the course of seventy-five Sandman comic books (plus various specials and mini series), Neil Gaiman told the complex, moving story of Morpheus, the Lord of the Dreaming, and his family, the Endless. Taken as a whole, the series constitutes a tale about a single character (Dream, a.k.a. Morpheus) and, as Frank McConnell points out in his excellent introduction, ""an intricate, funny and profound tale about tales, a story about why there are stories.""Dream is the central figure of the story. Tall, thin, pale, always dressed in black (the image of his creator?), he is truly a flawed hero, a godlike figure subject to the emotions and weaknesses of mankind. Able to create and destroy worlds on a whim, he fails as father and husband. Seemingly invincible, he can be brought down by the righteous anger of a distraught mother.For eight years, Gaiman mined this rich vein, only to stop at the height of the series' popularity, at a point in time when he felt the story he had in mind from the beginning had reached its natural conclusion. Gaiman's creations live on however, in DC's new series The Dreaming, and in this anthology, written by several mainstream (i.e., non-comic book) writers.Given the brilliance of the original comic, and with Gaiman co-editor, Sandman aficionados and novices alike might approach this anthology with high hopes. Unfortunately, they are likely to be somewhat disappointed. Perhaps the writers had to operate under severe restrictions; perhaps they didn't feel comfortable working within someone else's universe-it's hard to say. Although the stories are uniformly well crafted, they fail to break any new ground or provide novel insights into the rich cast of familiar characters. This is not to say that the anthology is entirely a waste of time-many of the stories are excellent, and all are readable. Still, the writers might have done more with the material.Enough negativity. The best story in this collection is Susanna Clarke's ""Stopp't Clock Yard,"" a tale that could easily have been part of the ""World's End"" story arc from the original series. (Gaiman himself comments ""I wish I had written this story."") Clarke tells the amusing tale of magician Isaac Trismegistus and rogue John Paramore, a pair who invade Morpheus' realm to bring the deceased back to their loved ones. Morpheus is rendered perfectly, a distracted deity, swift to anger, but patient in the extreme. Dream waits out his tormentors, only to have his revenge stolen away by one of his siblings.Other strong entries are Will Shetterly's ""Splatter"" (set at the infamous Serial Killers Convention seen in The Doll's House), George Alec Effinger's ""Seven Nights in Slumberland"" (a delightful tribute to both The Sandman and Little Nemo), Barbara Hambly's ""Each Damp Thing"" (a scary, funny piece featuring Cain and Abel), and Brenda W. Clough's ""The Birth Day"" (wherein Dream visits a storyteller who may be too clever for her own good). Honorable mentions include Colin Greenland's ""Masquerade and High Water,"" Tad Williams' ""The Writer's Child,"" Delia Sherman's ""The Witch's Heart,"" Nancy Collins' ""The Mender of Broken Dreams,"" and Gene Wolfe's ""Ain't You Most Done?"".One need not be familiar with the series to enjoy this book, but it helps. Most of the writers here seem content pursuing themes Gaiman has already visited rather than developing their own. It's hard to recommend the hardcover to general audiences, but the trade paperback is an elegant solution-for twelve dollars, most will be able to spend a few pleasurable hours with Dream and his kin. Rabid fans of the series may be disappointed, but general readers should enjoy the time they spend in The Dreaming.",1
If the author does not bring back Jo snow I will delete all these books. Just when I think all is going well VARYS comes back,1
I have read all five in this series by George R.R. Martin and surely look forward to the next.  Each book is a huge read...I never want them to end!!!  They are exciting and complex with an outstanding cast of charters and locales.,1
"This book is one of the best books I've read in a long while.  It spoke to me on so many levels!  It made me laugh, it made me cry, it held me captive from cover to cover!  This Author really did her homework, and it shows in her details and imagery she paints for you.  If you say ""I saw the movie, it wasn't all that""...well then, you need to forget everything you saw or heard on the silver screen, and pick up the novel!  Everyone knows Novels are ALWAYS better than the movie!  This one, especially.  When I read this book, I would laugh out loud and my Boyfriend (who is NOT a ""reader"") would say, ""What's so funny"" and I'd tell him a snippet about what I was reading....and before long, he and his 15 year old son were reading it right after me!I enjoyed it very much, and I believe you will too, or I wouldn't recommend it!Sincerely.Heather Lynn Osting - Author[...]",1
"The book came super fast, packaged perfectly and in perfect condition. Everything I'd expeced it to be. Could hardly believe the speed in which I received it.",1
"Full of atmosphere, world war II feel to it. He does a good job, in this whole series, of bringing Churchill to life as a very real and human character. It is a novel and not historical text book but he really takes you into the time and place. I've enjoyed this whole series, would recommend them to anyone who is interested in this era but remind them that they are fiction, good fiction never the less.",1
"Finally!  Though the first few chapters were a bit slow, this book once again showed the storytelling style I fell in love with in the first few books but seemed to have lost in the previous one. Can't wait for the next!",1
"This novel deserves the praises it gets simply for its scope and ultra-realistic future world on Mars. The author really ponders the political implications of settling Mars from long-standing ethnic and religous conflicts to ecological and enviornmental activism. The technical aspects of the story make it downright feasible to go to Mars right now.  And you'll be swept by the scale and number of characters...but there are a few problems.As a fan of what I call, socialogical sci-fi (Card, Heinlein, Dick), Robinson really shines in that catagory.  But the science got a little tedious for me.  Also the relationships between characters was a little Cinemax-like, but the different perspectives throughout the story helped balance it out.  As for it being long-winded, I found that this is a good book to put down at the end of one section, then pick it up later.  This way, the story didn't get too monotonous and I would find myself asking what the characters were going to do next.  Takes some time but this is a novel that deserves its acclaim.",1
"I finally finished the book, and while I have to admit there are a few great television moments, my overa-all reaction is, ""Meh"".This book was slightly better than the last one, although I liked the last one a lot more on a second reading, but I agree with all the people who feel that Martin is dragging this out.  It would be easier to not worry about it were it not for the fact that it will be another fifteen years minimum before we finally get the finale.And whatever enjoyment I was getting from reading was frequently interrupted by my need to quell my rage over Martin's *constant* usage of the phrase, ""much and more"" or ""little and less"".  It is a cute phrase used once, but when it pops up every third paragraph, it gets seriously irritating.  It is a stupid and lazy literary quirk that Martin ought to fix.  And any editor worth his salt ought to have called him on it.  Of course it does not destroy the book.  The book is still quite enjoyable.I am getting a bit tired of Martin's shtick too.  Oh, look who just got stabbed.  Sigh.  I bet HE won't get resurrected a-la Dondarrion.The book is worth a read, but in the end it just made me sad.",1
"This large format softcover book has beautiful pictures of various locations in the Mediterranean, as well as great pictures of almost every dish for which there is a recipe.  The recipes are easy to follow, measurements in English and metric, with a helpful notation about the recipe at the start of each one.  More importantly, they are useful dishes that you can acutally cook, not one of those books with 20 different ways to cook octopus. Where a particular local indgrediant is probably not available stateside, a creditable alternative is given. The book looks tasty to the eye, and the recipes are tasty as well. I am particularly fond of Turkish food and this cuisine is well represented, just as the other Mediterranean countires are.",1
"Martin did an excellent job of advancing his plot(s).  He chose to focus on each character/storyline consecutively, instead of advancing each thread more or less simultaneously as is often done.  I admit, it doesn't really work as well as the simultaneous method, but I've often wondered how his method would work, so I don't hold it against him.",1
"If you are looking for a light diverting read, this is it. If you are looking for historical fact about the lives of the Boleyns, this is most assuredly NOT it.It's not history, nor is it great literature, but I don't really think it's meant to be either. I recommend it only if you understand what you're getting yourself into; otherwise, you will be bitterly disappointed.",1
"Along Came a Spider is probably the epitome of what every crime-thriller novel should be. At 500 pages its easy to devour reading, the suspense is well balanced, but the real key to success is Alex Cross himself.Alex is a black, detective with a degree in psychology, who is passionate about his work, volunteers at a food bank and counsels on the side.And he isn't perfect, he loses his head and punches out racists, doesn't spend enough time at home with his kids and is a bit of a sucker for the ladies.The plot of the novel is pretty basic, but flows well, the first half reads like a standard serial killer case, the pace does slow a little in the second half as deeper intrigue is revealed.As a psychology major I like Alex's brief discussions about psyc, although I find his use of hypnotism dubious (but hey this was the early ninties not 2010)The love scenes are a little clumsy, particularly a steamy bath scene which kinda failed to interest.Most surprising was the ending (I'll try not to spoil anything) where one of the crooks gets their punishment. I found it oddly touching and poignant.Gushing about Alex Cross aside, highly recommended book",1
"Water for Elephants is the story of Jacob Jankowski.  After a tragic accident involving his parents, Jacob feels lost and unsure of his future.  One night he hops a train - only to find that he's hopped a circus train.  Because he is ""almost"" a vetrenarian they welcome him aboard (although not that nicely or easily) and he quickly becomes embroiled in a very predictable love triangle.Gruen does a great job with the transition from the ruminations of 93 year-old Jacob in the nursing home to 22 year-old Jacob on the traveling circus.  They're seemless and very well done.  Reading about the circus and life on a traveling circus during the depression era was also interesting.My complaint with the novel lies in the fact that as a reader I felt the author just skimmed the surface with this novel.  The story was predictable and shallow, and while the characters were decently developed, the overall story line just wasn't that great, IMHO.I was disappointed.",1
"The plot is simple, the characters memorable, and the clues, motives, and suspects pure Christie in this wonderful mystery that takes place at an English boarding school for girls.A young prince of a Middle East kingdom is killed in a flying accident and leaves behind a valuable collection of jewels to be smuggled into England by his friend Bob Rawlinson.  It is believed the jewels will turn up at Meadowbank School since not only the prince's sister but also the sister and niece of Bob Rawlinson are all students there.  Not surprisingly, murder after murder takes place at the prestigious school. Everyone from the headmistress and teachers to the students and parents are suspects until Poirot's clever little grey cells solve the mystery.",1
"Being a Christian in today's society is  often a scary thing.  People love to bad-mouth our faith in something invisible.  This book gives us the tools to strengthen our own selves before we get brave enough to talk to others, to offer them hospitality and then to help them know God themselves.  It's a 'read more than once' book.",1
"I love this series.  This is one of the best books I have read I a long time. I devoured the pages, could not put it down",1
"I absolutly LOVED this book! The characters jump off the page and you are transported into another time, in another world that is the circus life.  Once I started this book I never wanted to put it down.  I can't wait to read Sara Gruen's other titles, she is obviously a very talented author.Take my word for it, you'll LOVE this book!",1
"While reading this book, I was never sure who the 'other Boleyn girl' actually was.  At times it referred to Mary Boleyn, Anne's sister who conducted an affair with King Henry and bore him two children, and at other times it seemed to refer to Anne herself, who's driven ambition ultimately led her to the block.  This is a nice twist on the title which would lead you to believe that it was only Mary who was considered beneath contempt as the other Boleyn sister's fortunes rose.The choice of having Mary Boleyn as narrator of this story was inspired as it provides a completely different look at the complexities of court life and an intimate look at what it must have been like to be so tied to the future Queen of England even as your loyalties lay with the current Queen, Katherine of Aragon.  Mary is between a rock and a hard place and her guilt and confusion come through so clearly on the pages.  Katherine is portrayed sympathetically here as the cuckolded wife who must bear her husband's infidelities even as they happen right in front of her.As she goes from being the pawn in her family's game to raise the family's name at court to being a mere lady-in-waiting to her sister who manages to usurp her position, she realizes that her ultimate dream would be to own a farm in the country and to raise her children in peace, away from the glittering, cut-throat court.  As Anne finally becomes Queen of England, you get Mary's constant commentary on the familiar story of her inability to provide the King with a male heir, her frantic attempt to sustain her crown, and her eventual downfall ending with her beheading.  If I didn't already have a picture of her as a selfish manipulator, I would have been absolutely infuriated by her after reading of her behavior in this book!This is definitely a work of fiction as not much is known about Mary Boleyn, but what entertaining fiction it is!  Note: It does help to have a bit of background knowledge about the major players as the names and titles can get a bit confusing.",1
I bought a kindle for myself for Christmas...Clancy is my all time favorite author and I have read most not all (not a fan of the new ghost writing novels...YUCK) of his books. This is my favorite one...so...gonna buy the kindle version and see how it goes. Will come back and update what I think...,1
I am very impressed with Robin Hobb. I read this book on the recomendation of a friend. At first I was a little worried. The book starts out a tad slow. I was a little confused by the chapters pertaining to the serpents and the opening with the mysterious island didn't have me frothing at the bit.But then you get in the book and you just can't put it down. There are so many good storylines that run through the book. You quickly become engrossed in the actions and well being of the characters who are well rounded with their share of quirks and demons.The story line has you turning pages at an ungodly rate and when you reach the end you'll probably do what I did and run out and buy book two and three.But if like me you find yourself having problems getting into the book at first stick with it. It seems to be a trademark of the Robin Hobb books to start slow then explode into action.,1
Wonderful read! Captures Churchill ' s signature style while adding layers of depth to character. Great cast of characters. Could not put it down till I finished.,1
"Enjoyable, easy reading,  I look forward now to seeing the movie,  I loved the unexpected ending!  Well written story. Good.",1
"Hi!Curious thing about Oscar Wilde is that although he is frequently underrated, ignored, trivialized, forgotten or simply dismissed his works are also widely and frequently plagiarized. Not that he would care too much about that if he were alive.This book is a great collection of literary works by one of the greatest writers in the English language. Ranging from prose, fairy tales and drama through poetry to social commentary. This book has something for (almost) everyone, it is a great companion on long journeys and a breath of fresh air compared with some of the stale and stagnant ruminations of many an airport paper-back hero.Try it! it's good for the soul and the mind.regards......",1
"I had some sleepless nights reading this book. I enjoyed this book so much, I had dreams about Cross and him capturing Gary. I would recommend this book to those who would like to read a good mystery.",1
"I am on the fence about this one.  It was a good read, and the writing was not bad.  That said, it was not as ""terrifying"" or ""compelling"" as the blurbs stated. Of course, that is a matter of opinion, and we all know what they say about opinions. ;)As you can see from my other reviews, I read a *lot* of horror, and I may just be immune to the subtler forms of suspense and thrillers.",1
"A Djinn is a spirit, not visible to the naked eye, and to see one in Delhi, India you have to cleans yourself from the natural world by fasting and prayer .  In the ancient city of Delhi there are thousands, perhaps  tens of thousands of Djinns who serve to testify of both Delhi's glorious  and hideous  past.  Delhi is one of the oldest cities in the world and for  the past 3000 years has reincarnated itself.  To uncover its culture and  civilization takes the care and commitment of an archaeologist, or a  journalist.  William Dalrymple is an award winning journalist.  In 1994 he  was awarded the Cook Travel Award.  In City of Djinns, William Dalrymple  paints a vibrant portrait of Delhi past and present with colorful words.  His journalistic research and unique writing skills call forth the spirits  of both times past and present, illuminating for the reader the incredible  history of this city.His humorous and provocative description of how he  spent a year in Delhi, with his artistic wife Olivia, while he researched  the city's history brings contemporary Delhi alive.  True to life  characters, like his authoritative spendthrift landlady, Mrs. Puri, or his  slightly maniacal taxi drive Balvinder Singh, give his settings an unusual  liveliness.  Add India pigeon lovers, mystical healers, an enterprising  group of transvestites (eunuchs), the baffling Indian bureaucracy,  weddings,  parties, funerals and religious holidays and &quot;voila&quot;  you have an entertaining and informative travel/history book.If you are  going to, or ever have been to Delhi, India you owe it to yourself to read  City of Djinns.  Recommended.",1
"Of her trilogies. The characters are more in depth, less whiney. The setting is a repressing change from the norm in this genre.",1
It has helped to replace the many dysfunctional premises my sociopathic parents modeled! This is a book with a popularity which continues to grow at phenomenal rates! I had to buy this version since I'd lost my original classic one. There certainly NEED to be more Half Price Book Stores here in CA!!! I got spoiled by having 3-4 in Dallas alone!,1
"A cracking pace, familiar, likeable characters with dollops of humour and real life.  There is a follow up novel, Blood Price which is equally as good and features the same characters.  His hero is just an ordinary guy who has been thrust into an extraordinary situation - no Jack Reacher, just an average guy trying to survive and do what's right.  Read it, then read the rest of his novels, I haven't been disappointed.",1
"My sister insists that Tigana is a better read that Fionavar Tapestry. Somehow, even though I have read both and loved Tigana, I cant bring myself to judge Tigana over the Fionavar tapestry. The magic in FT is that you can bond to the central characters. You see them react and embrace their experiences thats literally out of their world. There is a bit of everything in FT, arthurian legend, romance, philosophical concepts, all meshed into a very human experience. I also loved the central struggle between light and dark, though I have read reviews that remark that it was modeled on JRR Tolkien's works. I feel that this is a jewel in the crown of Kay's works. His first, His warmest.",1
"Incredible series and extremely hard to put down once you start into one of the books.  Dark and feudal and most definitely bloody.  Surprising how Martin seems to like the bad guys to win almost all of the time.  But like most fans we surely do wonder when, or if, he will ever find an ending to this series.",1
"I loved this book.  It has history, suspense and a romance all in one!",1
"This is a wonderful story.  I first heard it on Chapter A Day and just finished reading it to fill in the parts I'd missed.  The extra bonus in reading the book is seeing all the fascinating historical pictures Gruen gathered from various circus museums.  I loved that some of the amazing things that Gruen discovered in her research about circus were woven into the story.  She began her research into the world of circus life by contacting Circus World Museum in Baraboo, WI which we have been to and love.  Gruen's book has added a whole new dimension to the world of the circus.",1
Another reviewer commented that this book was a combination of Jane Austen and Patrick O'Brian:  that's a perfect assessment.  I haven't gone wrong yet with a NYRB Classics.,1
"Isaw the movie on tv and wanted a more in  depth story. I really enjoyed the comments that the author  put in the book to add to the story. If the gold diggers has listened to the natives it would have been a lot easier for them no scurvy, for one.thing. the local cures that she added were interesting.",1
"Review of George MacDonald Fraser's ""Flashman.""As a student and admirer of the Victorian Era and anything Anglophilic I have long awaited the day of purchasing and reading the published ""Flashman Papers"" from manuscript form.I have seen Fraser's book advertised and critiqued for many years.  I set my decision to delve into the book as sort of a guilty pleasure and I was not disappointed.  If this genre interests you, then you should be quite pleasantly surprised.The abstract from the book itself clearly tells the prospective purchaser what to expect: ""Flashman follows Flashy as he lies, steals, duels, and wenches his way from 1839 England to India to the wilds of Afghanistan.  Along the way, he survives military incompetence, ambushes, torture, venomous snakes, and vengeful women...and emerges against all odds as a bona fide hero of the realm.""A most enjoyable read.  Flashman absolutely ranks with Ian Fleming's famous protagonist.Five stars without hesitation or reservation.",1
I will forever miss Tom Clancy and his great stories.  This is one of my favorites!  Couldn't put it down.  Action packed!,1
The quality of the writing is not in question. My problem is that I did not find the characters or plot to be engaging. I did not enjoy the book and have no interest in seeing the movie.,1
The story slows down alot from the first few books but still a great story and a great read. I love the character development it seems like everyone is taking a rest to figure out what they want to do rather than the normal fast paced action of the earlier books.,1
"I was very impressed with the voice of the character and the perfect balance of description and action in this book. The dusty setting is so realistically portrayed that I got thirsty while reading and even sneezed! The story satisfies on many levels as a paranormal mystery, an immersion experience in the life of a farm boy, and also as an exploration of the power of dreams as motivation and inspiration. Though this book is targeted to young people, I recommend it to anyone who wants to escape the real world for a while, and then rejoin it with a new perspective and appreciation.",1
I haven't seen the movie (I wanted to read the book first). I loved this story line. Very entertaining and such a fanastic ending. I really enjoyed it. I can't wait to see how the movie compares.,1
"Mixing historical fiction with sci-fi and mystery is no easy task to pull off successfully, but Arthur Slade hits a home run with ""Dust"".  It's the story of a small town in Saskatchewan during the Dust Bowl era of the 1930s.  A strange man comes to town with promises of being able to create rain, and almost everyone falls under his spell, despite the fact that several children in the area disappeared at the same time the strange man arrived.  Only Robert, the bookish brother of one of the missing children, and his Uncle Alden are able to resist the strange man's persuasion and do something to stop him.The pacing and atmosphere of this novel are excellent.  I found myself dropped right in the middle of the dusty Depression-era farming community every time I opened the book.  Robert is an entirely believable protagonist, struggling with conflicts that are both internal and external.  Though geared toward young adults, I'd strongly recommend ""Dust"" to anyone of any age who enjoys mysteries, historical fiction, coming-of-age tales, or sci-fi.",1
"Don't go to Rome without (Unless you have a private guide). This book made my visits to the Forum, Vatican, Coliseum, Museums and numerous public fountains and sculptures 100x more enjoyable by adding a much deeper layer of understanding. Wonderful.",1
I don't understand why anyone would give this book less than five stars.  Obviously I have read the four preceding novels and loved all of them as well.  Kudos to George for writing another awesome episode in the epic that is A Song of Ice and Fire.,1
"I love these books, but they keep raising questions and not giving any answers.  I really just want to know how things are going to line up to end it all, but overall another win from George RR Martin.  A must read for fans of the series.",1
"Flux was my first foray into hard sci-fi, and it was not what I expected. I had tried to read a few others in the genre, but was turned off by the textbook-like narratives and lifeless characters, but Baxter does a great job of combining the science behind the lives he has created within a solar body with the humanity of a race of intelligent beings clinging to the layers of their world. I can honestly say that I was captivated by this story, and enjoyed it thoroughly.",1
"I stumbled onto this book, and it opened my mind and began my process of becoming aware.Then I went across country to collect my deceased Grandmother's belongings. One item was this book. I opened the the cover and saw that Grandma had lent it out to her friends and they all had signed it. One person who had signed it was my Mom, who had died years before before my Grandma. I'm going to buy it for my little arrow now. 4th generation of passing it on.",1
The book explains the different types of clay cookware available.  It also tells how to clean and maintain this type of cookware.  It contains lots of great recipes easy enough for even the most beginning cooks ro master.,1
"This is one of the best, and one of the most beautiful, cookbooks I have ever seen or used. Great recipes, great pictures!",1
"Great pace - great characters - great flick, hope they do a second season.  Something about a continuation may be problematic,however, it would be great theater - if this is the Spacey/Wright version.",1
"This book is awesome. I usually like to read the book first, and then see the movie. In this case I saw the movie first. So happy I still read the book. It captures so much more of the characters' essence.",1
"GRRM is going down the same road as Robert Jordan did with the Wheel of Time series.  He started off strong, with excellent pacing, compelling characters, and a clear idea of where he wanted to go.But then...something happened.  Either he lost the thread, or he decided that he was making too much money and that he needed to drag things out, or a little of both.  Because whereas the first three books were some of the finest modern fiction ever written, these last two...aren't.Next to nothing substantial happens. There is precisely one ""major"" development towards the end.  There are rumors of other, interesting things happening ""off camera"", but GRRM used up too much space describing food to relate those.There'd be plenty of cliffhangers too, if I still actually cared enough about the story to fret about them, and if I didn't realize it'll be at least another 5 years before there's any resolution.Taken on it's own merits, it's not a bad book.  Not great, but not terrible either.  But taken as part of the series that started with AGoT, ACoK, and ASoS, it's simply proof that GRRM fell with AFfC, and hasn't gotten back up again.And now he's talking about how he might need 8 books instead of 7 to finish it?  At the current rate, he'll need 10 or 12.  At the current glacial pacing, it'll take at least 2 and probably 3 more books before the dragons come west, and another 4 or 5 before the Others actually attack.",1
This was a gift to my 92 year old father for his new Kindle.  He loved it & could relate because it was about an old guy reminissing & so many things were happening that it it kept him very interested. He read it in 2 or 3 days.,1
"As archives and witnesses in formerly Communist lands have become available to historians, we better understand the significance played by Western intellectuals promoting the Soviet agenda.  In Double Lives:  Stalin, Willi Munzenberg and the Seduction of the Intellectuals (New York:  Enigma Books, 2004; completely revised and updated), Stephen Koch details the tangled web of espionage and subversion spun by one of Lenin's and Stalin's premier agents, Willi Munzenberg, a German communist who ""covertly directed propaganda operations in the West"" (p. 5).  He mastered both the arts of spreading propaganda and enlisting fellow travelers, shaping public opinion through various ""Popular Front"" mechanisms to garner support for the Soviet position.""He wanted to instill the feeling, like a truth of nature, that seriously to criticize or challenge soviet policy was the unfailing mark of a bad, bigoted, and probably stupid person, while support was equally infallible proof of a forward-looking mind committed to all that was best for humanity and marked by an uplifting refinement of sensibility"" (p. 15).  He did so by co-opting public opinion in democratic countries and then denying he'd actually done so.  ""He organized in all the media:  newspapers, film, radio, books, magazines, the theater.  Every kind of `opinion maker' was involved:  writers, artists, actors, commentators, priests, ministers, professors, `business leaders,' scientists, psychologists, anyone at all whose opinion the public was likely to respect"" (p. 15).He shrewdly manipulated scores of left-leaning intellectuals, fellow travelers whom he disdainfully called the ""innocents.""  He played upon man's hunger for righteousness, for an inner sense of making the world a better place.  ""More than perhaps any other person of his era, he developed what may well be the leading moral illusion of the twentieth century;  the notion that in the modern age the principal arena of the moral life, the true realm of good and evil, is politics"" (p. 20).  Thus the ""lost generation"" of the `20s--writers and artists such as Lincoln Steffens and John Dos Passos, Ernest Hemingway, Bertolt Brecht and a cadre of Hollywood screenwriters and wealthy donors cultivated by another Soviet agent, Otto Katz--were Munzenberg's primary targets.Hemingway, an ""unchallenged celebrity"" in the `20s and `30s, was as important to Munzenberg as Andre Gide (the French novelist).  His literary style, providing a model for scores of writers, elicited an acclaim from all quarters.  He became ""the most influential moralist of the Word in his era,"" and, consequently, ""all three of the principal leaders of the Hollywood Popular Front--Lillian Hellman, Dashiel Hammett, and Dorothy Parker--were writers whose prose vulgarized Hemingway's style"" (p. 309).  Hemingway's prominent role in supporting the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War opened the door for Soviet apparatchiks looking for propaganda opportunities.  He was not himself a communist, only one of the ""useful idiots"" so easily manipulated by Munzenberg's men.Since the Bolsheviks saw America as a serious threat to their endeavors, it was necessary to awaken a ""worldwide anti-Americanism,"" to ""instill a reflexive loathing of the United States and its people"" (p. 41).  Alienated intellectuals, looking for righteous causes, were easily massaged by Munzenberg's ministrations.  The celebrated Sacco-Vanzetti case, for example, was almost wholly his creation, and he worked through a committee led by Gardner ""Pat"" Jackson, a prominent liberal of the day who persuaded Marion Frankfurter, the wife of Felix Frankfurter, a Harvard law professor who later became a Supreme Court Justice, to rally support for the accused killers.  When Sacco and Vanzetti were executed, Professor Frankfurter wrote an impassioned defense of them that appeared in the Atlantic and was widely circulated to assail the injustices of the American judicial system.During the `20s and `30s Munzenberg also promoted pacifism in the West, seeing it as a way to weaken (and if possible disarm) the democracies that might oppose the USSR.  Communists, of course were not pacifists!  They relished ""class war"" and attained their dictatorial goals through violence.  But they knew how ""peace"" and ""non-violence"" appeal to idealists, so they frequently worked through ""innocents"" intent on making the world a paradise through good intentions.  Bolsheviks such as Munzenberg thus easily found cooperative mouthpieces for their cause among Quakers and like-minded liberal Christians who made opposition to all war an item of faith.The world changed dramatically when Hitler seized power in the `30s.  Munzenberg fled his native Germany and found refuge in Paris, where he continued his subversive activities, promoting the Soviet agenda.  The Reichstag Fire in Berlin, for example, generated an enormous propaganda war as various factions (both Nazi and Communist) were blamed and political advantages gained in the aftermath.  Sitting in exile in Switzerland, Thomas Mann, the great German novelist, concluded that ""'in the final analysis the origin of the fire may itself remain as mysterious and elusive as the intellectual and subjective line dividing National Socialism from communism.  As I see it, the unconscious meaning of the trial lies in its exposure of the closeness, the kinship, yes even the identity of National Socialism and communism.  Its ""fruit"" will be to push to absurdity the hatred between the two camps and their idiotic determination to annihilate each other, when in fact there is no need for such enmity.  They are kindred though divergent manifestations of one and the same historical situation, the same political world, and are even less separable than are capitalism and Marxism.  Symbolic outbreaks like the Reichstag going up in flames are, we sense, even if we cannot prove it, their joint work'"" (pp. 132-133).In England, Munzenberg's apparatus drew wealthy, privileged students into the ""Cambridge Conspiracy.""  Similar work was done in ""every country of interest to the Bolsheviks"" (p. 180).  In America, recruiters targeted Ivy League colleges.  Elite, gifted youngsters easily adopt an ""adversary"" or ""counter-cultural"" stance regarding the ""establishment"" that enables them to live so comfortably.  This adversary culture appeals especially to ""vigorous intellectual and artistic"" youngsters who relish a radicalism that seems to represent ""freedom and truth.""  They want to ""tear aside the bourgeois faade"" and stand strong for ""the deepest truth"" ever known (p. 189).  Thus young men in England such as Guy Burgess and Kim Philby, Americans including Alger Hiss and Michael Straight (whose family owned the New Republic magazine) were recruited for the communist cause.  Young women too played an invaluable role.  Ella Winter served as Felix Frankfurter's secretary at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, ""guided the steps"" of her first husband, the famous muckraker, Lincoln Steffens, and ultimately became ""one of the most trusted party agents for the West Coast,"" working with special effectiveness within the Hollywood community.Given their elite standing, these youngsters naturally enjoyed easy entry into the highest realms of government, academe, the media and arts.  And they were ordered to ever support the Soviet cause and undermine Western democracies.  They were, of course, never to admit this.  Willi Munzenberg's widow, Babette Gross (an invaluable source for this book) remembered these agents' approach:  ""You do not endorse Stalin.  You do not call yourself a Communist.  You do not declare your love for the regime.  You do not call on people to support the Soviets.  Ever.  Under any circumstances"" (p. 249).  Rather:  ""You claim to be an independent-minded idealist.  You don't really understand politics, but you think the little guy is getting a lousy break.  You believe in open-mindedness.  You are shocked, frightened by what is going on right here on our own country.  You are frightened by the racism, by the oppression of the workingman"" (p. 250).  But in fact, all of these agents took their orders from Moscow!In time Munzenberg, along with virtually all veteran Bolsheviks, fell from Stalin's favor.  He managed to avoid execution through various shrewd maneuvers, but he died (hanged under mysterious circumstances) soon after German forces invaded France in 1940.  Double Lives reads much like a mystery novel, but it deals with some of the most historically significant currents of the 20th century.",1
"Once again,Patrick O'Brian bats a home run. The author manages to make day-to-day - in fact a minute to minute - life aboard a Napoleon-era man-of-war seem like it is happening contemporaneously. And a very exciting life it is too. Aubrey's skill as a mariner is amply displayed, as are the machinations of .Maturin. I used to think the C.S.Forester's Hornblower was the ultimate in sea stories of that era, but his skill has been supplanted, in my view, by O'Brien. If you like sea stories you will love this one.",1
"Yes, I know the ending seemed a little farfetched, but I LOVED it...and the rest of the book too. Being ignorant about the behind the scenes drama and actions of a circus, Sara Gruen educated me with her well-researched Water for Elephants. The novel was informative and well, graphic at times, and I'll never again enter the big top without feeling some compassion for the roustabouts, the performers, and the animals...especially the elephants. Ah, Rosie. Silver Star too.In addition to educating her readers about the traveling circus life of a bygone era, Gruen also tells a vivid and believable tale about a vet student who, because of a ""cruel twist of fate,"" runs away to join the circus. Although the primary story revolves around Jacob and Marlena, the author does a fabulous job of character development as she describes Camel, August, Uncle Al, and other assorted circus folks in a story of love, cruelty, sadness, grief, and triumph.About that ending, I still think it's awesome and quite believable, especially for someone like Jacob who lived his life to the fullest. Maybe there's a lesson in that for all of us.",1
"There seem to be two types of Oscar Wilde biographies. One, treats him like a sexual martyr and hardly gets into his huge talents at all. The other talks only about his career and treats the episode with Lord Alfred Douglass like a spot on an otherwise pristine carpet. Jospeh Pearce refuses to take either path. He looks at Oscar Wilde, the man, the artist and the broken soul. Wilde had some ideas about himself and was like Herod, fascinated by religion but was unable to stir himself to change. He a genius and was spoiled, pampered and protected by his class and talent but that left him totally unprepared for a brute of a man like the Marquiss of Queensbury.Pearce is gentle with Wilde but he doesn't excuse him. Wilde failed his wife and his sons miserably and the nameless, faceless rent boys of London weren't just props, they were shabbily used human beings. Pearce makes this all clear but he also discusses the hope of Wilde's life, his last minute conversion. Give this well written book a try. It is a completely different and fresh look at Oscar Wilde.",1
"I'll be honest, I don't understand half of the naval jargon. But I love these books. The vividness of the battles really draws me in. I look forward to reading more.",1
"Not my favorite Christie.  I have nearly all of her books and have read most of them.  I had a hard time getting through this one; it is not like most of the others. It's not terrible, but not a must-read.",1
"My third Hemingway book. I had been intimidated by it for a while (mostly by reputation), tackling his smaller, less dense works instead. Finally I picked it up and never regretted it. It took me a while to get through the middle section, but once I got through that I couldn't put it down. While on vacation in Chicago, I even took it with me and read while at a bar with friends. Every book I've read since pales in comparison.",1
"Went into this with an attitude because of the over-exposure it was receiving, but my reservations quickly faded and I was actually flying through the pages to an unexpected, heart-warming ending.",1
"This book is a glimpse into circuses and carnivals of the past, in all their sordid glory. I was as fascinated with the circus life as I was with Jacob's story.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was fascinated with the book's description and became determined to read it. On an unexpected day off, I began reading and couldn't put it down. It has an unexpected depth.",1
I thought this would be the final volume but it seems it's going to stretch on forever which wouldn't be bad if the readers didn't have to wait forever for Winds of Winter and a Dream of Spring. Hopefully the HBO cash will push him into a more productive mode.,1
"Water for ElephantsSara GruenA 90-year-old man--or is he 93?--narrates the story of his one summer as a veterinarian with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth during the summer of 1931 in Depression-era America.  Jacob Jankowski resides in an assisted living home with other elderly people, many of whom require more medical attention than he.  He is quite mentally astute for his age, yet because of his age, most of the people in charge of the facility treat him as mentally incompetent, all but Rosemary, a forty-seven-year-old nurse, who treats him and the rest of the patients/residents with the loving care, dignity, and respect they deserve as human beings.  But she is moving away and will be quitting the facility, which in the end leads to Jacob's decision to continue his life--what little he may have left--in dignity.There is a circus that has come to town.  It is so close to the facility that the big tent and other goings on can be observed from the window.  All of the old people reminisce about their experiences in their youth going to the circus.  One old man and a newcomer to the home, Mr. Joseph McGuinty, who is considerably younger than Jacob, brags about having worked in a circus, carrying ""water for elephants.""  Jacob becomes upset because he knows Mr. McGuinty is lying to attract the attention of the other residents; and the memories of the truth of his past life are triggered.Flashback to young Jacob Jankowski, a veterinary student at Cornell University in his last year!  Just before he is scheduled to take his final exams, after which he will graduate and receive his degree, both his parents are killed in an automobile accident.  After their burial and after learning the truth of his financial situation, Jacob is unable to focus.  He leaves the exam room and leaves Cornell.  Distraught, he leaves with only the clothes on his back and no money in his pocket.Because of the Depression, people were unable to pay for his father's services; and his father, also a veterinarian, worked for people even though they could not pay him, taking whatever they could give him--eggs, chickens, whatever they had.  Therefore, his parents had nothing to leave their son but debts.  To pay his tuition, the house had been mortgaged.So not being able to focus, he leaves without ever putting pen to paper.  Without aim or destination, he walks and soon finds himself beside the railroad tracks, when along comes a train.  Like a hobo, he hops the train with no idea where he is going.  He soon learns this is a circus train and is not tossed off it because the Benzini Brothers, whose circus it is, discover he is a veterinarian; and his services are badly needed.Working as a veterinarian that summer leads to all kinds of experiences, tantamount among them which are falling in love, getting married, and eventually working with the circus's one elephant.After his summer with the Benzini Brothers, he is hired by Ringling Brothers.  He, along with his wife and his growing family, spends seven years as a circus veterinarian.  He then becomes the veterinarian for the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago.  His seven years experience with exotic animals and his degree, in addition to bringing an elephant with him, insures him the job when the former vet suddenly dies.Jacob, ninety years old--or is he 93? he asks himself, recognizing that his old age has caused some memory loss--struggles to hold onto his humanity and his dignity as long as he can.  It is he who in his reminiscences about his circus life, his friendships, and his deep love for his wife narrates the story.  The reader falls in love with Jacob and develops an even greater love and respect for ""old folks.""  Sara Gruen's novel awakens the reader to the often mistreatment of and disrespect for the elderly, evoking empathy in their cause.  Especially hurtful is seeing how their own families, their own children, mistreat them, or forget about them.  Old people are still human beings.  In many cases, their bodies may be broken, their hands and fingers gnarled, but in all cases, there is a brain inside their heads as Jacob proves.  In having Jacob tell his story in Water for Elephants, the author informs us of this and reminds us of the fact that we will grow old someday.  At the same time Sara Gruen affords us a moving and delightful read--so do not be misled by the title.",1
"First: I like long books with interesting themes.  I enjoyed getting to know the characters of the previous books (even though I had to refer to a cheat sheet at times to keep them all straight).  BUT:  This book was a nightmare of fog and misdirection.  The introduction of new characters scattered my focus on the plot...oh, that's right, the plot was somewhere in the fog.  I wanted to scream &#34;HODOR&#34; at times.  Will there be some sort of last book that will finally make sense of it all?  One can hope.",1
"Too graphic for kids, too infantile for adults...this was just an OK book. I read it because several people recommended it for our book club at work. Many of the characters were so badly drawn and one-dimensional that I lost interest mid-story. The August character in particular was the worst creation: he's a ripoff of Nathan from William Styron's ""Sophie's Choice."" Marlena is just sequined cardboard. I enjoyed the setting because there's something fascinating about circuses, or else I would have rated this lower than 3 stars. For a book supposedly about people who care about animals, it doesn't have touching moments or much emotion. Vastly overrrated novel.",1
Although I liked this book very much I am struggling to explain why.I guess it was sort of weird and imaginative in a good way.,1
"Much better, George. Much, much better! 'A Dance with Dragons' is a redemption of sorts from Martin's last book 'A Feast for Crows"". It starts off a little slow, but then gets a lot more exciting as it progresses. Martin still tells a lot more than he shows and when he shows sometimes he shows too much, but at least here he practices some restraint. The editing is tighter, and the prose is much stronger. Best of all, there's a lot more action, and it involves my favorite characters. I was surprised by a few things, but overall there were no shocking twists. I am concerned about one character in particular. I can't see how the story can go on without this particular character, but I guess I'll just have to wait and see. The strength of this series is that you have no idea if the characters you love will make it and I really appreciate that Martin isn't playing favorites with any character, even the popular ones.Overall, this is a good read. Not the best in the series, but definitely not the worst. I have renewed hope for this story now, and I really wish he would hurry up and write the next one!flag",1
My kindle version of this book. I like Agatha Christie books. Her style of writing and the way she draws you into the lives of the people keeps you picking up the book! Nice story.,1
"I find this a little difficult to follow, but that could just be me.  I would prefer more concise information.",1
"I have been reading George RR Martin since the mid-nineties, and consider A Song of Ice and Fire to be a work of genius.  That said, Dance is my least favorite of the books so far, even though I have insider info on what will happen to Jon. (Cackle.) We all know how cavalierly he kills off beloved characters, but this book was a bit over the top for me.  But of course I am waiting anxiously for the next book. . . .",1
"This is one of the best books I've read recently.  It spans the life of a woman kidnapped from Africa as a child and follows her journey from the ship that brought her into slavery through her old age,as she becomes a much sought after and respected woman of letters.  The author has sprinkled the book with historical facts throughout and woven a tapestry of such compelling characters that I got lost in the book and couldn't put down.  I recommend this book highly.",1
"*Update*I've noticed many of the 1-3 star reviews are written by individuals who either skipped entire chapters in this book, didn't finish the book, or in some extreme cases, didn't read A Feast for Crows.  I appreciate the full disclosure, but I don't believe that a reviewer can offer a meaningful, credible review without completing the reviewed work in its entirety.  I read both AFFC and ADWD completely, and I enjoyed both books.  Not everyone will enjoy them, but I imagine that anyone who skips whole chapters, or even whole books, will, without exception, write a negative review.  You would have to be critical of it before even starting to skip some of the stories, and skipping passages would likely not improve your opinion.  I found that characters I cared nothing about before starting this book, like Victarion Greyjoy, became some of my favorites; I would never have known these plots would come to interest me had I skipped chapters I didn't eagerly await.  Similarly, had I skipped AFFC, I would never even have come in contact with Victarion before starting ADWD.--Review:Martin should have cut the book off as soon as the timelines from AFFC and ADWD converged chronologically.  Or, alternatively, completed some of the timelines that end abruptly -- and in some cases, with an easily discernable next step -- instead of truncating them at 15-30% completion. The former would have made a shorter -- but still long!  -- book; the latter would have made a substantially longer -- but better -- book.Massive spoilers ahead.Some of the plotlines that should have been carried through:1. Cersei's trial.  Ser Robert Strong will certainly win.  (And in the same vein, it's fairly clear that Ser Robert Strong is a resurrected or preserved Ser Gregor Clegane.)2. Aegon's attack on Storm's End.3. Barristan's battle at Meereen.4. Victarion's arrival in Meereen.  Why end with him floating in the straits?5. Bran's further learning from Bloodraven.  Seemed to end abruptly, in the middle of the teaching.5. Theon and Jeyne's time in Stannis' camp, from Theon's viewpoint.I'm glad that certain other plots ended where they did, as the ending clearly segued into the next segment.  They are:1.  Jon's possible death.  I think it likely Melisandre will heal him, as the red priests clearly possess this power, but it's a good, natural finish.2.  Arya's completion of training at the Temple of Black and White.  Her tutelage with her first mentor is a good beginning for her story in the next book.3. Davos' setting off for Skagos.  This storyline will begin (and hopefully end) in TWOW.4. Tyrion's solicitation of the Second Sons.  We don't know his plans, but it's a good finish to his time in Meereen.5. Quentyn's death.  Seems apt.6. Lady Nym setting off for King's Landing.7. Daenerys' rescue/capture by Khal Jhoqo and Mago.I'm also glad Martin left certain stories out entirely.  They will make for interesting plots in the next book.  They are:1. Sansa's engagement to Harry the Heir.2. Brienne and Lady Stoneheart's plans.3. Loras Tyrell.",1
"Good solid recipes. I am a seasoned cook and have tried a half dozen of the recipes in this book.  They are not too difficult to execute...but mostly, I just like to look at the pictures. This would make a great gift.",1
The previous volumes read easier-how do you say  flowed better. The TV series was more interesting...this volume has way less character development.,1
"Three star average review?  For one of the best-selling fantasy books of all time? At the end of the day, it's important to the casual reader of these reviews to realize what's really going on here.This series is extraordinarily important in the fantasy cannon, it breaks new ground, and is well written and very entertaining.  It is also somewhat protracted, and to be fair books 4 & 5 stall a bit.  The fan base is incredibly invested in this series, and many feel betrayed by the slow pace of book releases, leading to a backlash of sorts by a vocal minority (nevertheless this minority all buy the books).  People love these books, they live for these books, and if they're even slightly disappointed in any aspect of a book, they feel betrayed.The comparisons of George RR Martin and Robert Jordan, and his shameless protraction of the Wheel of Time books is grossly unfair, Jordan's books were a rambling mess, Martin's books are detailed, but well designed and coherent.  Could the series have been finished in 3-4 volumes instead of the planned 7 - probably, but the protraction never feels wanton or obvious.At the end of the day, the success of these books in regard to the sales numbers speak for themselves.  This is one of the best ""Epic Fantasy"" series of all time, and will be ranked along with Tolkien, Donaldson, and McCaffrey.",1
"After reading Water for Elephants, it was hard to pinpoint what made it so great. The honesty in the writing, the splashes of romance, or the fascinating events. Perhaps it was the inside view of circus life as it used to be. Whatever it was, I have to say Water for Elephants is, as the ring leader might put it: Spectacular!",1
I waited almost 7 years for this next book in the series and it did not disappoint..but only when reaching the end!,1
"I really enjoyed this book, it is interesting and hold's your interest. The premise of the book is creative, I recommened this read.",1
"I was amazed, surprised, and entertained while reading this book, who ever thought about life in a traveling circus! not me that's for sure. Along the entertainment value, the facts, the history, the research was superb.I look forward the movie, even the author and her family will have a cameo.",1
"...but also an extremely well written beginning to an excellent series.  Make no mistake, this book is not for the faint-hearted.  There are scenes in here that'll make the blood boil and the stomach turn.  And most of the book deals with the relationship (if you can call it that) between Angus Thermopyle and Morn Hyland, with Morn acting as little more than a toy of Angus, who gets most of the character development.  Donaldson takes us deep into the recesses Thermopyle's twisted soul, and makes the reader wallow with Morn in those festering sewers.  This is actually necessary to understand her motivations later in the series, since The Real Story is mostly set-up for what follows later.Really, it's well-written stuff that stays with you long after you put the book down (whether you want it to or not).  If you can get through it, it's worth the read.  But make sure you continue the series.  But if you're looking for an uplifting, mind-expanding story with a happy ending, look somewhere else.",1
"There are only four books in my life that I have read twice (and I am an avid reader), and this is one of them.  The follow up to this book, The Boleyn Inheritance, is one of those four as well.  I have loved the history of King Henry VIII ever since my amazing 8th grade teacher and completely enjoyed this novel.  Do not look for this book to be a non-fiction, play by play account of complete and total facts.  However, the author did her research, and developed a page turning novel that I couldn't get enough of.",1
"I am a new Tom Clancy reader starting with rainbow six then moving on to this book, to read a little more about john clark (Kelly).  I have to say it did keep me on the edge of my seat with all the twist and turns, he could have made this into three different novels if he wanted.  I loved it.  Thought it an excellent read and am looking forward to reading more of Clancy's titles, I hope they are as good as the last two.",1
"Outstanding!!!  Love this series and am waiting eagerly for the next installment.Very skillful blending of politics, warfare, magic, fantasy and the unexpected.",1
"I really enjoyed this book. Sarah Gruen did a great job of telling the story ofcircus with all the beauty, cruelty and the harsh life during the depression.The author states that she did research the circus during that time period and it shows in her writing.  She really describes the  people and animals that were the main part of a circus and they  come to life in my mind. I could see and hear them as I read the book.It starts off with the main character, Jacob Jankowski as a very angry oldman in a nursing home. He decides to go to the circus and reminisces about his past. We are then introduced to the young Jacob Jankowski. The book goes back and forth in time as many do today.The author really nails it when she writes about the depression. I have read and studied the depression and she portrayes it so vividly. I felt so sorry for the workers, performers and the animals. They all suffered in one way or another.The characters had their flaws.The book paints the Ringleader as a charming but violent man. One who had a short fuse and was a loose cannon.I was fascinated by Jacob Jankowski. In spite of the hardships that he had to endure,his kindness and gentleness never wavered.I admired Marlena as a beautiful, graceful and long-suffering woman. She was  not brave enough to leave. I recommend this book to all. The movie followed the book very closely except the Ringleader was not as mean as in the book.",1
"This is a great read. The book is as exciting as the earlier books in the series. Once opening it, you will never be able to put it down.",1
"Philippa Gregory is a genius. The best historical fiction author by far. This novel was amazing, so much rich detail from King Henry XIII to the Boleyn family and the offspring. Its magestic and enthralling. Makes you wish you could go back in time (not necessarily to be a Boleyn) but just to be in the court and to experience the wonderment that is Philippa Gregory's Tudor Engand.",1
"One of the best book series I've ever read, can't wait for book 6,7,, & 8.  The HBO series brings the many characters and dragons alive. I still encourage the tv show watchers to also read the books. If you are looking for that great escape with a never ending story, this is the book series for you.  Enjoy. I know I did.",1
"Book five just like book four more characters take charge more die, more are in other states. Not that it isn't good or that it is bad, it just is. You rout for one then get broken hearted and curse as your hero just bit the bullet. It's an interesting way of writing, reel you in then behead them. Will I read the next one? Yes but only because I want to see the twisted end...",1
"""Along Came A Spider"" is an okay installment to the Alex Cross series in my eyes.  I think that it is overrated, but I do think that it is okay for being the first.The writing is good and the characters are interesting.  Patterson does a great job introducing the main character, Alex Cross himself, in a fitting way.  But the best parts are when we see him with his family.  And his kids are so adorable.  Janelle and Damon make me want to see them more.  Including Nana Mama, who I just love seeing getting into arguments with Alex.  Other characters like John, Jezzie, and Soneji I actually like.  The mystery is done well too.But this novel has its problems.  The romance between Alex and Jezzie feels a little forced (despite that there is some development).  The final twist at the end really makes me angry.  I won't give anything major away, but it deals with Jezzie and I really hate what Patterson did to her.  I love Jezzie as a character.  It didn't sit well with me.  Even the time jumps feel out of place.  They don't go back and forth or anything, they just skip a couple of weeks or months, which made the pacing of the novel itself feel a little to slow.  Soneji's character didn't get the attention that I was hoping for in the end.  In fact, the ending itself felt a little to depressing.In the end, despite its problems I might have with it, this novel works out fine and it makes me excited for Alex's next adventure.  I say it is worth reading and buying.",1
"""Water for Elephants"" is on the best sellers list! No wonder! It was a great book. I enjoyed each segment whether it was set at the nursing home or the circus. I thought the characters were well thought out and believable. We will review this book at our next book club meeting.",1
"As inspired as I was after ""The Sun Also Rises"", I am even more crushed by this one. If you have any idea of writing something real someday, steer well clear of ""For Whom the Bell Tolls."" What a genius work of character development and atmosphere.",1
"I have to tell on myself.  I didn't realize that George R.R. Martin had planned a longer series that 5 books.  When I started A Song of Ice and Fire, I was looking forward to a conclusion and all the various story lines finally coming together and answering my questions.  About half-way through I started thinking, there is no way there can be a satisfactory conclusion in the number of pages left.  Then, I went to Google and found out there was more to come!Martin has woven together many strands of color into an entertaining tapestry of an epic tale.  I truly do not understand how he does this so successfully.I have enjoyed this entire series.  It really helped that I had seen most of the HBO shows.  Gave me good mental images of the major players.  Doesn't mean I didn't sometimes get confused but the Family Lines/Information at the end of each book really help.",1
"A long wait has a way of raising expectations to levels that often cannot be met.This, however, is not the case with ""A Dance with Dragons"". It delivers the characters it promised to deliver (and more; I loved every one of the new POVs as well as the chapters reconnecting with characters from ""A Feast for Crows"") and it delivers the rich atmosphere, shocking plot twists and fascinating background details that make ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" a stand-out series. Martin is a master storyteller who isn't bound by genre or by conventions; some chapters are high fantasy, others are almost pure horror, and it all blends so very well.Admittedly, I was not one of those who was disappointed in the previous book, ""A Feast for Crows"". In fact, I rank it my second favourite, after ""A Game of Thrones"" but alongside ""A Storm of Swords"". Where would I place ""A Dance with Dragons""? Narrowly below AFfC and ASoS and a fair bit ahead of ""A Clash of Kings"". In terms of stars, I would place all but ACoK at 5, with it somewhere around 4 or 4 1/2 if that existed.Those who didn't care for ""A Feast for Crows"" may find the first half of ADwD to be somewhat similar in tone and pacing and they may also find themselves less enamoured than I was with the new POVs. However, the build-up of the first half comes to several very strong (I hesitate to use the word ""satisfying"" because the emotions elicited by what happens aren't quite right for that) conclusions in the latter half.",1
I first read the novel 35 years ago. I was entranced by Wouk's human characterizations and his grasp of history. He allows you to BELIEVE in the story. I probably have it all memorized by now but I still grab a read now and then. Definitely 5 stars.,1
"I really loved the first three books of George RR Martin's epic.  So when the fourth and fifth book came out in paperback, I was eager to catch up on all of the characters after the climactic events in the third novel.I was disappointed by the pacing and character development of the fourth and fifth novel.  The fourth and fifth book were meant to be written as a one super-big book, and that should have confirmed for me my worst suspicion: the author has just written too much and is in much need of an editor.  Pacing seemed sluggish, and the characters did not really make any meaningful changes as far as I could tell.  Interweaving storylines were interesting upon first reading, but soon felt a bit too contrived.I'm no stranger to long books, as most every novel I read is at least 600 pages long.  I love classics like Count of Monte Cristo and Les Miserables, and I love more modern authors who tend towards longer books (Shantaram, Frank Herbert, Neal Stephenson, and Iain Banks).  Martin's first three in the series are classics...but I doubt I will return to these two or the final two once they are published.",1
"While Martin is very creative, he can also be very wordy. This saga seems to go on endlessly with little closure and definitely not much success by the main characters. Many adult themes. Probably won't buy book six. Lost me on several of the more advanced conceptual descriptions such as the &#34;trees&#34; world with the black sky. Martin drops hundreds if not thousands of names which is extremely distracting. I have no idea what role some of those individuals play in the overall story or the history.",1
"What an amazing book.  The story is engrossing, the main character is lovable and realistic and the story is fascinating.  This is one of the best books I have ever read.Bravo!  Amazing book. It made me smile and it made me cry.  I simply LOVED this book and will recommend it to all my friends.  Well written and wonderful characters.  Great read.",1
This book was everything I hoped it would be and more. A heart wrenching love tale set in the circus world in the great depression era. The characters capture your heart and hold it captive until the very last page.,1
"Of course For Whom the Bell Tolls is in English, but everyone speaks Spanish. Hemingway tries to create Spanish sounding English by stretching the syntax of English nearly to its breaking point, by rendering Spanish-ism into odd English phrases, like ""what passes with thee?"" for que pasa, a common Spanish greeting.Hemingway also uses archaic English usages to present forms that exist in Spanish, but are gone from English, like thee and thou for the second person pronoun. It makes for strange but captivating reading. Here is a writer rendering English into Spanish forms. The results are startling and not always enjoyable; but it always gives you the impression that you have entered another world.If the novel was written in more fluid English, the result would not have been so unusual. The very clumsiness of the language reminds the reader that this is a novel that is taking place in another, somewhat more formal language. And the English bears that imprint.When we read For Whom the Bell Tolls we can see English both reaching into its past to create diction of current usage, as well as using an odd and foreign syntax to give the illusion of another language.  Often, this effect was criticized.  But an open reading of this novel shows what an effective technique this is and how well it does the heavy lifting of expressing another culture's values on the level of language from one tongue to another.",1
"Jack Ryan is President of the United States, and finds his nation at war with terrorists who have released a plague on the country.  Iran is on the march to take over the Middle East, supported by India.  And the United States must use its now limited resources to support its Arab allies.  I had heard that Clancy was questioned by the CIA on where he got his information for this book, and I can believe it.  It rings as real as the headlines of the war that followed in truth.  Jack Ryan may not know much about politics, but he sure knows a lot about being a strong leader and a man.  Clancy was once again the master.  Won't give much more away, except to say ""Go Wolfpack"".",1
"The whole Patrick O'Brian are works of art and will grab you for Captain Aubrey's entire career.  Interesting to note how many obstacles he overcomes as he climbs the ladder of command in the Royal Navy.  Its a good primer for young folks starting a career; it is not always a rocket path to the top.  You will encounter traditions, rules, and technology that impede your goals; and one has to be a risk taker.  Again and again Aubrey takes risks, rallies his seamen, and prevails.  One wonders if a personality like Aubrey would be tolerated in our risk aversion US Navy today.",1
"A lot of characters but the story is a little loose.  Still, on his worst days, George R.R.Martin writes a better book than almost anyone writing fantasy.  I think that this could  easily have been part of Book Four rather than a free standing Book Five. However  I just read them not write them.  Even if it is the weakest of the five it is still very good and worth every minute spent reading it.  I am afraid that it will be a while for Books 6,7, and 8.  Too bad.",1
"Short stories are a wonderful genre, and Oscar's are as good as anyone's, well, almost anyone's. This one is clearly written and the ending is surprising.",1
"WOW. It's been a long time since I read a book this good--I was so sad when it ended!  I kept wishing I could share more of Jacob's amazing life--and the ending, what a boffo finish.  I would have NEVER guessed that one! This is much beyond a good ""summer read""--how is it this book did not hit #1??  I love historical fiction, and I am usually very 'into' the time period and the 'feel' of the era...this one was particularly evocative; you could swear you smelled the animal cars, the greasy scent of the carnie food, the whiff of the stale sleeping quarters.  I could almost feel sweet Rosie's pain at the hands of the cruel August; and when he met his fate, I cheered Rosie like she was a hero (she's an ELEPHANT).  What a rich read--if you begin it, make sure you don't need to sleep that night!",1
