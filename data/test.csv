"Clancy's best work seems to be behind him. This book is nowhere near in the same league as _Red Storm Rising_ or _Clear and Present Danger_. I stopped reading about halfway through and then skimmed through the rest a  couple months later. The plot was decent enough, but the excessive  technical details and Clancy's endless preaching of his political views  ruin it. This book would have been much better if cut down to just over  half its size. Maybe two stars seems unfair but that's all this book  deserves compared to earlier work. Let's hope that the next book, about a  Sino-Russian conflict, will give us back the Clancy of the '80s.",0
"Its clear now after Feast and Dancing either Martin, the publisher, or both want to milk this for all its worth and there is no plan to conclude the saga. Yet again, as in FFC this one has no plots resolved and too many new characters. I remember when this was supposed to be a three book series. I wish it had stayed that way. I will buy the next book but I will buy a used version because the series is no longer worth $10.",0
"I enjoy stories about past lives. I love good historical novels. I have some first hand experience with hypnotic regression. I usually love novels written 20-30 years ago. But not this one. It managed to annoy me on many levels.One could excuse the repeated violent rape scenes, including one perpetrated by the hero, as being characteristic of the 1980s when this book was written, as that was a time before women had finally figured out that a man who says ""I love you"" and then perpetrates a violent rape belongs in prison, not in your bed.One might even excuse as characteristic of the 1980s is the fact that all the protagonists in the story behave like alcoholics, downing what we now would consider volumes of drink that would be diagnosed as binge drinking in just about every scene set in the present.But one one cannot excuse the ridiculous way in which hypnosis and past life regression are presented in this story and the silly way that everyone including supposed medical professionals encourage what would be in real life a psychotic reaction in the heroine.The heroine herself is Too Stupid to Live--the classic dumb heroine who, when warned not to go down into the darkened basement while a killer is on the loose and the power is out, always goes into the basement. If you enjoy that kind of story you'll love this one. If you like your heroine to be slightly brighter than a guinea pig, save your 99 cents and download something else.The worst part of this book is that the writer has enough of a command of style to get you reading this bloated, endlessly long book. So that it isn't until you've gotten more than half way through that you realize just how stupid the plotting is. If you keep reading after that you are rewarded with a completely unbelievable and emotionally unsatisfied ending.Further complaints: The book claims that the history that lies behind the endlessly dull past-life story is well-researched, but any author who puts bubonic plague into a story set in the last decades of the 1100s has NOT done their research. Even in the days before Google mildly educated people knew that the plague first appeared in Europe in 1348.If the book had swept me into an emotionally moving story I would have easily overlooked the innaccuracies, but the emotional interaction between the main characters is wooden and we never get into their heads or feel their reactions, both in the story set in the present and the one in the past. Both are static, with no character undergoing a hint of growth anywhere. The characters are the same on at the end (which felt like page 9000 by the time I got there) as they were in Chapter 1. How this book got to be a bestseller in a world that produced Outlander a few years later is beyond me.Perhaps you had to read it in 1985 to love it, since there do seem to be many readers who did. But reading it in 2012, I certainly didn't. Between the rape scenes and the endless boring interactions between dull English people living what must have been considered a glamorous life in the mid-1980s this book struck me as one that should have remained a fond memory.",0
"No soft cover book available, maybe someday the book industry will care about fans of books and actually release the softcover at initial release so people that do not like hard cover can actually share in the story..",0
"The author went to Burma already with his mind made up; things were bad and he was going to see more bad things and talk to people with bad experiences, and have bad experiences himself, and have a thoroughly miserable time the whole time he was there. And he managed to do just that. In no way at all was his writing ""beautiful"" or ""poetic."" But he managed to miss the beautiful and poetic side of the amazing Burmese people in the country he visited. Not a good introduction to this much-misunderstood country or the resilient people who live there.",0
"I like Tom Clancy's books, but I thought the whole premise to this one was just silly.  There were too many contradictions in the story for it or the characters to be believable.  The hero is an ex special forces guy, trying to help a new girlfriend face her past demons and bring evil men (murderers) to justice.  Instead of heading straight for the cops he decides to joy ride in her old neighborhood where she is recognized and immediately becomes a target.  (I know when I am trying to protect someone I love from harm I always drive down to the projects.)  They are chased and shot at but manage to escape.  But instead of immediately heading to safety at the police station (still their destination), they park in a secluded area and decide to wait there until their cop buddy comes on duty, and then drive to see him.  Well the bad guys never quit looking, and sneak up on the parked couple. Mr Tough Guy gets caught by surprise and his girl dies. In the hospital, he vows revenge because he is such a tough guy (his nickname was even Snake, he's such a bad mother-f***).  Sure.  He's such a badass that he brought his love into a dangerous neighborhood, let them get ambushed and got her killed.  Watch out everybody!  Here comes the Homer Simpson of the vengeance league.",0
"I am very disappointed with this book. The story may have made a beautiful movie (which I have never seen), but it does not pass master as reading. The characters are cardboard cutouts from the standard psychopatic egomaniacal killer to the Alex Cross'es family. There is one (yes, I mean ONE) plot twist that is more or less interesting, the rest is so rote it is funny. The writer has no skills whatsoever in building tension. He also cannot put together an interesting description. I will not even touch the dialog with a ten foot pole. And why on Earth do viewpoints have to shift all the time? We don't learn anything interesting when they do.",0
"I wish I could say it took me two weeks to finish this book because I was savoring it.  After all I had been so excited that I pre-ordered this book the first day I could.  Heck, I almost ordered it via the UK Amazon just so I could get it sooner, but after the bad taste ""A Feast..."" left in my mouth I wasn't quite willing to shell out the big bucks that would have required.I was giddy with anticipation, and having been reminded how good the series is by HBO, I felt like a kid at Christmas when the UPS man dropped off my copy of ""A Dance...""Two weeks and a thousand pages later, George RR Martin has lost me as a reader.  Never mind the five years, the nine other books he published or edited between ""A Feast..."" and ""A Dance..."", or the slow paced unsatisfying novel that ""A Feast..."" was.  It would have been worth it had this book delivered.  I would have gladly gone back to being the GRRM fanboy I was, preaching the wonders that is his Song of Ice and Fire, but no.  I can't.Much has already been said about how long the book is.  Its long and you feel every page.  The words crawl by, the plot and stories advance sluggishly at best, and new characters are introduced to replace characters that have been killed off, brought back, and killed off again.  The existing characters, exist only as a backdrop to the history and turtles that GRRM wants to talk about.  Only rather than telling those stories, through characters, plot lines, and differing points of view, he reduces characters, such as Tyrion, to disinterested third party narrators.Gone is the suspense, missing is the magic, and lost is the laser like focus of the first three books.  It should say a lot that the most interesting plots in ""A Dance..."" seem almost tacked on, after thoughts to the story GRRM wanted to tell.  Though rougher, and less polished than the main storylines in the novel, these ""other"" stories show flashes of brilliance and a return to storytelling that made GRRM great in the first place.  Sadly though, these stories are few and separated by hundreds of pages, and dozens of chapters about nothing.More tragically its seems that GRRM has found his ""Wesley Crusher"", something he had managed to avoid doing (or at least managed to avoid being eye stabbingly obvious) about in his prior books.  This is perhaps the biggest disappointment for me, authors need to keep themselves and their Mary Sue's out of their books.One last note and only because I haven't seen it mentioned in the other reviews.  GRRM interjected quite a bit of his personal views and politics in both ""A Feast..."" and ""A Dance..."".  There is nothing wrong with this as such, most authors do this, without even realizing it.  They project their world view upon a fictional world of their own making and its impossible for it not to happen.  ""A Dance..."" very much became a heavy handed and preachy vehicle for his politics.",0
"Jacob Jankowski's parents perfunctorily die in the opening of this mawkish melodrama, and Jacob drops out of vet school and runs away to join the circus, where he finds fast work as a veterinarian for a menagerie of anthropomorphic animals. Jacob also finds romance (not with the animals), adventure and a real Snidely Whiplash of a villain. Sara Gruen copies the manipulative, crowd-pleasing instincts of Stephen King and Ron Howard without displaying any of the personality seen in those men's work. She writes in a bland, transparent, easy-to-read prose of cliche, predictability and cheap sentiment. This is the kind of book you can read in a single afternoon without ever having to pause to think. It goes down like a bag of circus cotton candy, and it's about as nourishing. Strictly LCD entertainment. It's like ""Titanic"" at the circus! It's like ""Seabiscuit"" with an elephant! After reading one of the most ludicrous endings ever written in the history of populist claptrap, I think I'm being more than generous with my two stars. To the critics who overpraised ""Water for Elephants,"" I offer this quote from the novel: ""Surely you can't all be happy with this ... this ... pap?""",0
"I bought Red Mars because it won the Nebula Award.  I suspect it got the award for its detailed description of Mars and its terraforming, not for its quality as a novel per se.1. Unity: Poor.  Many scenes and dialogues in the book serve no purpose.  For example, an entire chapter contains the musings of a psychologist about a personality theory that simply does not fit into the narrative.  The character is barely heard from before the chapter, and barely heard from after.2. Narration: Poor.  The book switches narrators frequently: one is from one character's point of view, the other from another's.  This makes everything disjointed and ununified.  Worse, the thoughts and feelings of each are strangely similar.  One gets all of the detriment without any of the benefit of this musical chairs narration.3. Plot structure: Poor.  There is snappy opening chapter with most the rest of the book as a flashback, but the rest has barely any structure.  Sometimes the author is merely digressing into Martian geography.  The ""climax"" towards the end is an excruciatingly long description of a flood.  I thought it would never end.  When it did, the novel was over.  It was disappointingly anticlimactic.4. Plausibility: Poor.  The story starts in 2026 with no account of why Earth has suddenly decided to inundate Mars with thousands of colonists and gigantic robots.  I had to force myself to believe it was starting in 2126.  The immense expense of such an operation in 2026 is completely unbelievable.  100 permanent colonists, followed a few years later by 1000?!  Within 30-40 years, there are a million people on Mars and a space elevator.  Outrageous.  Worse, there is little to no political structure to the planet: there is only anarchy.  Earth is willing to invest the majority of its GDP in a far-off planet but is indifferent about governing the people there...?5. Scientific accuracy: suspicious.  The author speaks of ""degrees Kelvin.""  There are no degrees in the Kelvin scale, only in Centigrade and Fahrenheit.  I learned this in high school chemistry, which Stanley-Robinson apparently never had.6. Dependencia economics: a joke.  The highly educated scientists that were the first colonists preach pure dependencia economics.  They say that rich countries (the North) stripped the poor countries (the South) of everything worthwhile they had and continue to enslave them by trade.  Big companies are too powerful and can manipulate governments.  They highjack the economy to exploit everyone but themselves.  Rank neo-Marxism and laughable.  Stanley-Robinson has never had a course in economics, I'd bet.7. Length: Poor (700 pp.).  I lost interest half-way through and finished just to be done with it.  Some passages I had to skim.",0
"I really didn't like this book very much.  In its favor, it's well researched, but the crudeness of the characters and animal cruelty turned me off.  I'm sure it's very accurate in its portrayal of the times, I'd just rather read something uplifting.  I read it based on a recommendation from a family member.  I, on the other hand, would not recommend it.",0
"I am completely convinced that the author of A Dance with Dragons is not the same person who wrote A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, and A Storm of Swords.  Here's my reasoning.  Take the book A Storm of Swords.  Open it to any page.  Now open A Dance with Dragons to the same page number.  Read the page in A Storm of Swords and immediately read the page of A Dance with Dragons.  Repeat this process three of four times.  A simliar comparison of A Dance with Dragons to A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings is worth the effort.Compare the use of dialog, narrative, and even punctuation.  The difference is amazing isn't it.  Most reviews are complaining that A Dance with Dragons is a poor companion to the first three books in the series based on plot and lack of forward momentum, but no one is addressing the reason behind the slip in quality. My take is that the difference in the very mechanics of writing between A Dance with Dragons and the first three books is so dramatic the it could not possibly be written by the same author.So who wrote A Dance with Dragons?  If it was truly George R. R. Martin, then who wrote the first three books?  It just can't be the same guy.",0
"First off, let me say that i am a huge and dedicated fan of the great Dame Agatha Chrisite. I have read almost all her books, and i think she is the greatest mystery writer ever.However, this rather fantastical effort is a departure from her usual murder mysteries into the murky world of espionage and the discovery of an anarchistic conspiracy run by neo-Nazis. The net effect is an amateurish and boring plot burdened by superfluous characters and a lack of exposition.The main character seems to be likable Sir Stafford Nye, who is actually quite an interesting persona, until he is inexplicably dumped halfway through the book in favour of a fly-on-the-wall observation of various Cabinet meetings that are essentially redundant in telling the reader that the danger faced is very serious and mysterious. There are also long, abstract and irrelevant dialogues between mono-dimensional characters that make Agatha Christie seem at sea with a genre that is apparently too big for her.When the mastermind behind the conspiracy is uncovered, we see a brief flash of the old Christie, as the culprit is someone whom the reader never suspects. However, the epilogue, instead of explaining the culprit's motives or the fates of the various conspirators is instead a humorous yet unsatisfactory marriage between Sir Stafford and another character.Several times during the narrative, I found the courage and fortitude to continue only by telling myself that the ending would be as brilliant and fulfilling as all her previous novels, yet once again, I was thoroughly disappointed with this sad excuse for a novel",0
"In my continuing effort to read all of Dick's work, I picked up the finally-reprinted Our Friends from Frolix 8 this week.  What a disappointment!I really like Dick's writing, and I have even enjoyed some of his less than stellar novels, like The Zap Gun or Clans of the Alphane Moon.  This one, though, just doesn't do much for me.  It's got a decent premise and some decent (but predictably Dickian) characters, but it just doesn't pull it all together and produce.The climax was too long in coming and, once it came, was a let down.  For the most part, I'm just glad to have finished it.",0
"For months, everytime I was in a bookstore - I found that I would gravitate toward this book, read the back and place it back on the shelf.  I should have listened to my instinct.  After many positive recommendations from friends and reading the reviews, I relunctantly check the book out at the local library.  I started reading with an open mind.  After about 200 pages, I phone my friend to ask her if I was missing something, because I just didn't care of the story and I couldn't seem to find a connection with any of the characters.  At this point, she instructed me to stop reading - ""because of you don't like it now, there isn't anything earth shattering that will happen that will make you change your mind.""  I didn't listen, and she was right.",0
"This novel bored me.  And I like Hemingway's work.  Pilar's tragic stories go on and on, as do pointless conversations in caves with desperate people swearing at each other and hitting each other in the mouth (which, alas, only encourages more conversation instead of silencing it).  The constant use of &quot;obscenity,&quot; &quot;muck,&quot; etc. instead of the real swear words is truly wearying, and the translation of Spanish terms into &quot;thee,&quot; &quot;thou,&quot; and &quot;less bad&quot; mean nothing at all to the casual English reader.Nor is Robert Jordan (why does Hemingway keep using his full name throughout the novel?  That's irritating too) much help, being a typical Hemingway strong-and-silent-type who drinks too much, enjoys bullfights, and lives to sleep with pretty 19-year-olds.  &quot;The earth moved&quot; is the best he can do in the supposedly passionate and brief love scenes with Maria, who enjoys pouring him more wine while washing his feet.  His doubts about doing his duty are neither profound nor convincing.  Until well into the novel he's a too-typical freedom fighter who justifies duty over Eros in dreary inner conversations.  Like another reviewer put it, I wished a quarter into the novel that he'd spare me his musings, blow the damned bridge and go home.",0
Did not care for this book.  I don't know if I would classify it as more weird or just stupid.  The concept of alchemists and the curse associated with passing of dried human skin was pretty crazy.  I like a good horror book but this was just not my cup of tea.,0
"I started reading the series after watching the first year of Game of Thrones on HBO. The books were as exciting as the series. I had purchased the four book package and when I finished it, there were too many gaps left open with no path for the reader to follow. Mr. Martin explained that there is a book 5 coming that is actually a parallel to book 4, as there was too much information to be presented.I definitely agreed that there were way too many holes and characters that you care about left hanging at the end. So, I looked forward to book 5, A Dance with Dragons.I have to say it was one of the worst endings to anything I have ever read. It was like "" I have to finish this, but don't know where to take it. Let's just kill off everyone and throw in more people!"". Except all the new characters are so disgusting you can't wait for the book to end. Characters that were so important to this series are dead and others that book 4 indicated were killed, seem to walk off happily together in book 5.I did see in the HBO Series, some movement in the second season that deviated from book 2. If there is any hope left, the producers will save Game of Thrones. If they stay on the path of the books, I fear all is lost. Maybe that is what Mr. Martin is trying to convey.",0
"I enjoyed the first three books of the series, but the last two left me feeling cheated and sorry that I had ever started reading A Song of Ice and Fire.  I feel like Martin could have cut out a lot of pointless material and given us a satisfying trilogy with a real ending. Instead I wasted a lot of time and money as I slogged to the end hoping for resolution.  I have told my husband who has watched the TV series not to bother reading it.The best thing I can say about the series as a whole is that the books had really good titles.A Dance with Dragons was the worst of the series.  It goes round and round like water down a toilet bowl.  I kept thinking at least one story line would reach a satisfying conclusion, but, alas, it appears Mr. Martin just gave up.Normally, when I read a series that I enjoy, I seek out everything else that author has written.  Even though I have heard good things about Martin's earlier work, this series has left me with no desire to investigate.",0
UGH! The first couple chapters were wonderful. Then it went downhill so fast I thought I was reading another book. don't waste your money.,0
I want to offer a little dissent here.  I thought the book to be a bit dull and slow.  I really labored to get through it and becuase of it completely turned me off to the rest of his work.  It could be that I spend too much time reading action fiction so I need a fast paced book to keep me interested.,0
"This book was an epic fail, a fantasy ""Days of Our Lives"" where the plot moves at a snail's pace and old familiar characters die off while new ones are introduced exponentially.I wonder if GRRRRM even knows where he is going with this book. This series has become akin to a movie that I heard was good, and started off good, but turned out to be bad, but I just keep watching either because I expect it to get better, or I have already invested so much time in it.I cannot understand why this would merit 5 stars from anyone other than those making money off of it. To me 5 stars makes it one of the all time best books I have ever read, one that I will reread again and again because it is so entertaining, one that I think fondly of, or causes me to think in new ways, or inspires me to change my life. How can this book be any of those things to anyone, even to the author?At most I would think it should get 3 stars, but that would only be due to it being part of a larger series. By itself it should get one star, if that.The only redeeming feature of the book is the cliffhanger at the end, but if that situation turns out bad (character dies) then my interest in this series as a whole will die along with him.",0
"I loved the first three books, but four and five are basically 2000 pages of nothing.  It is clear that Martin is milking the story and has absically abandonded anything resembling a plot now that he can start collecting HBO royalities and stretch this out as long as possible.  The books read like a soap opera and moves just about as fast.  To be honest there are about 400 pages of intersting, well written, story telling embedded in the almost 2000 pages of books four and five.  Good luck inding them.",0
Everyone else has already said it and much better than I could ever write.  I've never been so disappointed in a book/series as George RR Martin's. So many strong characters have been lost along with their stories.  What a mess.  I hope HBO can improve upon these books and give us a successful and satisfactory conclusion.,0
Had not gotten around to reading the book when I had the opportunity to see the movie.  I doubt I'll ever bother to read this one.  Wasted money on it too as most of my downloaded books are free. Choose wisely.,0
"I got through half of the book before I became so bored that I read the last chapter to find out what happens to the characters.  The whole premise of European brutality towards African slaves becomes mundane repitition and nothing new or insightful is brought to light through the experiences of either Francis or Mehuru.  It comes as no surprise that they fall in love nor is it the least bit interesting to read in light that the whole black man/woman smart, insightful slave and uncaring, raping, brutal white slaver stereotype is definitely overplayed.",0
"This was a real disappointment. Although I enjoyed the 1st couple of books, it was a real effort for me to get through this one. This book series has gone from a well-written tale with suspense in almost every chapter to a long-winded soap opera where each installment contains less real substance.In this book, the same 3 storylines persist: Impending threat from beyond the Wall; warring for control of the Seven Kingdoms; Daenerys and her dragons in the east (Will she EVER come to Westeros?) Instead of bringing the story to a climax/denouement, Martin continues to drag it out. There is too much repetition and seemingly unnecessary characters or chapters. Some examples include the chapters about Quentyn Martell or Victarion Greyjoy. What real value do they have to the main story? This same question can be asked about the chapter with Daenerys walking alone in the Dothraki sea of grass. Most of this chapter is a review of events covered in earlier books (since who could remember it all after 5000 pages). The only really interesting point in this chapter was who she meets - described in the last paragraph. Why didn't the author just scrap the rest and start with that scene?? Redundancies were also noted in the 1st half of the book which was filled with descriptions of burned out villages, razed castles and mutilated bodies - very dark and disturbing. How many times does the author want to describe carnage?A good story has to deliver its climax/point; otherwise the audience loses interest. Maybe some criticism should go to the editor, who should have encouraged the author to delete such repetitions and extraneous pages.  Why keep 1000 verbose pages, if the story could have been better told in half that space?One oddity was that 3/4 of the way through, Martin scraps using character names for the titles and instead tries things like ""The Queen's Hand"" or ""The Discarded Knight"". Using the character names tied the book together. This arbitrary change seems to suggest that Martin has indeed lost his focus in this series...much as Dany loses her purpose in Meereen. Tyrion's escapades and wit were the book's one saving grace.Reviews have described Martin as the next Tolkien. I initially agreed with that. Now, after over 5000 pages and no end to the story in sight, that comparison no longer holds true. Tolkien gave his story closure (which is what made that series phenomenal) ...we're still waiting on Martin (and getting bored).As suggested by another reviewer, one wonders if rather than creating a good tale, he is now writing for future royalties or TV series??",0
"There might be a good story here, but personally, the excessive profanity and sexual situations were offputting.  I returned the book unfinished.",0
"In ""An Apple a Day"" the McGill University professor Joe Schwarcz offers salient useful nutritional advice.  Eat lots of fruits and vegetables.  Meat is fine but make sure you have more whole grains on your plate.  Emphasize variety and balance in your diet.  Avoid processed foods, especially those high in fat, sugar, and salt.  Exercise.  There are no miracle foods and short cuts to a healthy diet.That's great advice that comes at page 353 of this 355-page book.  I have many issues with the structure of the book, the main being Dr. Schwarcz's decision to divide his book into easily digestible chapters tackling all the major food debates out there:  organic, genetically modified, detox, and so on.  It would have been a much better book if Dr. Schwarcz structured it around his main thesis:  that there are no short cuts to a healthy diet.Science has spent decades and billions of dollars analyzing the different components of food in the hope of distilling the magical qualities of apples and tomatoes, and selling it in a bottle.  There is no scientific basis for the overwhelming superiority of a certain vitamin, chemical, or nutritional supplement.  Quite the opposite:  eating or drinking too much of a good thing can be a bad thing.  Seeking balance, moderation, and variety in nutrition is the best and only path to good health.",0
"This review refers to the abridged audio book, read by David Dukes.The story was entertaining enough, but Mr. Dukes' reading was quite disappointing. He seemed to squeeze all of Mr. Clancy's many characters into one of a few vocal catagories: noble, pinched, gruff, and female. (The &quot;female&quot; voice, a too-soft falsetto southern belle, was particularly painful.) Many passages began with Mr. Dukes reading spoken dialogue which I mistook for a completely unintended character. Also, his voice tends to taper off at the ends of his sentances, I suppose for dramatic effect. I often got the impression that Mr. Dukes was thinking, &quot;Man, I really sound cool reading this really cool book...&quot;FYI - On a side note, I'm not a fan of written or verbal profanity, and this book has more than its fair share.",0
"Having read the first four books - and finding the fourth lacking - I nevertheless decided to read A Dance With  Dragons.  It's pretty clear that Martin has become bored and hasn't figured out how to bring all of the story lines to a fitting conclusion. So, he content to keep writing about this knight or that knight.  Interesting characters are less so now and new, boring ones are created. I encourage everyone to read the first three books in the series, yes! But know that if you keep reading beyond three, you'll be disappointed.",0
"An American nuclear-powered submarine stationed in a British base is sent up, towards the North Pole, on a fact-finding and rescue mission about a British Arctic base, the interrupted last radio message of which was an S.O.S.-Mayday one. The submarine is carrying, as a guest, an English agent who also has personal reasons of interest. It comes out that the base had been almost totally destroyed by arson. A few survivors in terminal condition from frost are found and revived; the agent solves the riddle, prevents - nay, turns around 180 degrees - the final damage, and exposes the villainous traitor during the return trip(family circumstances of personal relevance are included). This book is in key with all others by the same author: introduce a seemingly desperate situation, masterminded by a super-fiend who is usually controlled by the bad side of the Iron Curtain; enter the afore-said super-duper British Secret Service agent (a past master in 20 different languages and all of their 300 dialects, and in all crafts of his trade. The situation evolves from bad to worse, apparently with no hope, till page "" n/2 + 1 "", but Superty-Duperty keeps working at it until the devilish plot is uncovered. Final confrontation with Super-Fiend, and his utter humiliation, defeat and ruin. Down curtain, everybody stand up for ""Rule Britannia"". Read one book by this author and you've read'em all, in a ""very pompous indeed"" style of writing.",0
"Go into this novel understanding that the writing will be stylistically poor, the characters one-dimensional, and the plot development a bit static, and you can still eke out some enjoyment from it.When I began reading, I realized how shockingly little I actually knew about the subject and wanted to learn more about these fascinating people. Unfortunately, I had to go outside the book to do so. Not a single character breaks out of one-dimensionality. No one is developed past a single defining trait, which quickly become dead horses as, at every opportunity, Gregory repeats them for you. On page 10, all that can be said of Mary and Anne is that each is respectively sweet/naive and cunning/ambitious. Read another hundred pages and still no more can be said of either.This lack of fundamental development plagues her writing in all aspects, but I won't list them and rant. I can understand the one star reviews some give. However, if she must write poorly, at least she writes poorly about an interesting microcosm in history. Though the characters will still be soulless strangers to you upon finishing, hopefully you'll share my experience of having a piqued interest in this period that you can pursue.While I was amused by it and am glad to have read it, I can't in good conscience give a rating of 3 stars. It is a below average work. If you're looking for a beach read (unchallenging, reads quickly), this is probably your book.",0
It wasn't obviously my type of book. Maybe it was because I had such a high expectation? The best part of the book was the author's note at the end. I enjoyed reading that.,0
"The tale is getting ragged, the twists are overplayed, and the droning text (frequently mistaken for creative prose), makes caring for the characters and their causes more than a minor struggle. I might read the next book in the series, but only because I stumble across it in the bargain bin.",0
"This novel follows the adventures of Ivar Frederiksen, son of a nobleman of the planet Aeneas, who has dared to challenge the authority of the Terran Empire, and as a result must flee for his life, even while searching for some way to secure his planet's freedom.  Having led a pathetically feeble revolt against an infinitely more powerful military force, Ivar has no choice but to hide among the various nomadic peoples of his planet, hoping that their innate distrust of outsiders will dissuade them from betraying him.  He gains an ally in Erannath, a large, bird-like creature from another empire, but no one can say for certain what his real agenda is.  The story climaxes when Ivar is introduced to Jaan, a prophet who is possessed by a 6-million-year-old member of the race of &quot;Elders&quot; whose archeological remains are venerated all over the planet.  Can these two men set in motion forces that will free their people before being captured by Terran police?  This reader found himself not caring well before the halfway point of this tedious book.  Indeed, the first two-thirds of the novel are painfully slow and pointless, as various characters are elaborately positioned, analyzed, and persuaded.  Although Anderson's powers of description are excellent, at times even poetic, and his use of the Elder, Caruith, is intriguing, his action scenes are too often abbreviated, or even skipped, showing us only the aftermath of the action.  It was probably a mistake to chooseFrederiksen as the main character, since he does little of significance until the very end.  Instead, he spends most of the book running and hiding, and there's very little thrill in this chase since his trackers are seldom close enough or dangerous enough to really engage the reader.  Anderson had a good enough idea for this book, showing how a rebellious young man of privilege could join forces with a working-class visionary to shake up the establishment, but he took far too long to get his story started, and by the time things really got moving, it was nearly ended.  It's hard to believe that the average reader will even finish this book, let alone enjoy it.",0
Ugh! What a total waste of time and money. I can not beleive the author relied so heavily on constant erotica. If she could have left that out it may have been a good story. Don't waste your money!,0
"I loved the first three books.  I was hoping the 4th was a fluke, but after finally getting through a Dance with Dragons I am bored.  I actually couldn't read more than one chapter without falling asleep.  I feel like half of this book could have been cut out and still gotten to the same ending point.  I would love to know how the story ends, but I don't think I can get through another book like this without knowing when the end is.",0
"I've nearly read everything by James Herbert, and I have to say he writes a lot of bad books. And a lot of average books. And some rare really good books. This one belongs in the middlefield.The story sounds interesting, but he doesn't make anything of it really. The war scenario is also useless. Even the title sounds sooo interesting, but in the end... well, is has some suspense, but it's pulp suspense with no real content.This is fast-read stuff. Okay, but time can be better spent.",0
"but fractured delivery. I liked reading this book, but the audio version was unsatisfactory, continually jumping forward and backward in time. Also the quality was disappointing, skipping sections of the narrative and increasing the difficulty with following the plot,",0
"There are SPOILERS involved with this review.  I have to include these because the GRRM fanatics believe that if you do not like this book, then you have never read the book and therefore if you post on any of the forums you must be a troll unless you include spoilers to prove you read the book.First, can we stop with the endless repetitions???  These are repeated hundreds of times throughout the book, after a while it is just worthless and we realize the Mr.Martin is just trying to up his word count.1.Where do whores go?  The imp dsoen't know, we get it.2.Reek, Reek, my name is reek, it rhymes with (?????).  We get it, reek rhymes with many different words, are you going to go through the alphabet?3.You know nothing Jon Snow.  O.K. He's ignorant, can we move on?4.I am just a young girl...Dany's young, are you trying to make sure we don't forget, or that you don't Mr. Martin?5.Word are wind.  We know, we read your book.  We are surprised that it did not blow itself off the shelves.6.Corn. Corn. Corn......Okay Ravens eat corn, we know.First of all there is way TOO MUCH filler and fluff in this book.At the beginning we are given page after page after page after page etc...of fluff just to find out that A) six skins dies and enters the one eyed wolf and B) that Jon Snow is a skin changer too, but dosen't know it.Conserning Jon we are subjected to a second retelling of Jon sending away Sam and making the baby switch. Did Mr Martin forget that he wrote this in AFFC?  Does he think his readers forgot (it has been a while)?After letting the wildlings cross the wall to help fight the others (somehow his seasoned brothers are all retarded and do not understand that they are undermaned and will die and lose the wall without help).Jon is then stabbed four times by his brothers.  We are never told he is dead and never see his body, so because of all the endless drivel at the beginning of the book most readers will have missed that he is a skin changer, so maybe he changed skins, maybe he is just wounded, or maybe he will come back from the dead like his mother.Bran finds the three eyed crow and learns that he is a greenseer.With the imp we are treated to his bathroom habits.  Do we really need to know everytime he goes to the bathroom?  Have a little bit of a hang up with the bathroom habits of little people do we Mr. Martin?Then we are treated to his travel log. Worse than reading a tech manual.  Words are wind Mr. Martin.He then becomes a slave, rides a pig in a mummers joust, walks away from slavery and on his word alone hires a sellsword company and joins them.The onion knight eats and we get to hear of every bite.  We know you like food Mr. Martin (we've seen your pic) but we do not need a play by play of his eating.A. Stark loses her sight and then gets it back and then commits her first assaination.Thon Grayjoy, through torture is transformed into Reek.  Eventually he helps Jane escape Ramsay Bolton.Dany keeps telling anyone who will listen that she is young, as if they or she has forgotten.  She chains up two dragosn because they are uncontrollable.  She thenmarries, and then flys away on the black dragon while Mereen is underseige.The prince of Dorn is killed by the green dragon (fire) while trying to steal the two dragons who are locked up.Mr. Martin thought his baby switching plot was so good that he told it again in this book.  Not only that but he was so proud of this ""original"" idea that he recycled itthree times.  We are told that a prince of dragons was not killed during the first rebellion, but was switched as a baby and now he is back to retake the iron throne.  Then we are told that the king beyond the wall did not die by fire but was switched with rattleshirt.  Plus A. Stark and Jane are switched.  Who else are we going to switch?  Maybe Jon was not Jon when he was stabbed, maybe he was switched.  Might as well recycle the plot one more time.Cersie confesses some of her crimes and does a walk of shame.  Now she is awaiting trial by combat.The queen is waiting a trial by the church.Little finger returns to kill the king regent because he wants the kingdoms to be at war so it is easier for the dragon prince to retake the iron throne.Jamie rides away with Brienne and is not heard from.Stannis marched on winterfell where we again are given more filler than you can shake a stick at.  Do we need a play by play of the snow march?  Then we are told in a letter that he and his friends are dead (maybe a lie?).Mance Rayder (switched with rattleshirt) takes six spear wives and tries to free the Stark girl (again a recycling of the switching plot, she is not Stark but Jane).We are told in Ramsay's letter that he is held captive and the six spear wives are dead.There was supposed to be a continunity check but we find out that grayscale is not what it was.  It was a childhood disease but has somehow become a life long illness like leprosey.Mr. Martin tells us he has a problem writing strong women and children.  Well, maybe he should not have so many strong women and children in his book.  It is funny though that he did not have a problem writing strong women and children in the first three books.  Are we sure Mr. Marting wrote books four and five? Dany and Jon are totally different characters with no development on how they changed.  He has lost sight of his story and is now offereing us filler and excuses.People have been comparing him to Tolkin.  The only thing he and Tolkin have in common is the ""RR"" in their names.  Anyone who makes this comparison has never read Tolkin or has become so emotionally invested in this story that they are blind to the truth.  Tolkin never wrote just to see how many words he could put to paper.  He wrote a complete story from start to finish.  At Mr. Martins pace and with these last two books of his he will be remembered as ""The man who tried real hard"".The only saving grace about this book is that I got it for free.  I am the third person to read this copy and the first person received it as a gift.  I will give it to someone else so that at least four people will not have paid for this crap and four people will not have given Mr. Martin anymore money.  I am leaving now to trade my copies of the first four books of this series at the used bookstore.  Maybe I will go back to Eddings.",0
"Halfway through and I can go on no longer. Nothing has happened and judging from other reviews nothing continues to happen. The breaking point for me was one too many pages of useless whining from some female dwarf that Tyrion meets; yes, another throwaway minor character that GRRM seems strangely fascinated by. Sadly, I don't share his fascination, and no longer care about this series, which has degenerated into a strange combination of travelogue, torture porn, and food criticism.",0
"I loved the concept, an epic series of colonizing Mars - but the book rambles endlessly. I don't need to be taught pseudo-science on terraforming. Just tell me the basics and I'll willingly suspect my disbelief. I don't need pages of math & science - it doesn't add to the literary value.I had no interest in the other books in the series.",0
"I only stumbled onto this series because of the HBO series.  And I devoured the first four books in about a week and a half, at the same time re-reading the Black Company series from the beginning even as I was in the middle of She is the Darkness. To say I like this particular genre would be an understatement.I fell in love with the series.  And that's been rare and rarer occurrence in recent years.  Truth be told, in fantasy genre, there are a lot of trash out there.  But when you love the genre, you wade through them in hopes of finding something like this series.  Even with the good books, after so many of them in so many years, they don't touch you as the early ones once did.  But this one certainly did.  I cannot even remember being as horrified and actually ANGRY at the villains as I was when I was reading through the Red Wedding.  When you're as jaded as I conceit myself to be, that's a treat indeed.So this book was a huge disappointment.  In fact, this seems another Wheel of Time in the making.  At the risk of sounding snobbish, that's not a compliment.  Maybe the author doesn't mind.  Churning books is lucrative, and as people invest in characters, they forgive much and dutifully buy the next installment.  but if you can't tell a story in about three books (the LotR standard), maybe you shouldn't write. (I know, the Black Company is like 7 books long but the change of POV narrator keeps the books pretty fresh)This book goes nowhere in particular, stews like the thin broth the starving masses (and there are many in this book) huddle around, and dissolves into a cliffhanger that actually gives no suspense.Bear with me for a sec.  Parents who prep the young ones for daycare in the morning may be familiar with an educational PBS program called Between the Lions.  One of the skits is a crudely animated short called ""Cliffhanger"" where a mountaineer perpetually hangs from a stunted tree limp on a cliff.  Each episode, he contrives a way to be rescued and in the end, he still ends up hanging from the cliff.  The music concludes, ""Cliiiif hanger, hanging from the cliff.  That's why he's named... Cliff Hanger!""That's this book.However, I will grant the maps in the beginning of the book are drawn much nicer.I'll finish this series, no doubt.  And it can be redeemed with the resolution in the next book.  But I finish all my series, even the foul, unreadable ones. (see my Ed Greenwood book review)",0
"Like many I came to this series when HBO premiered A Game of Thrones.I'm disappointed for 2 reasons:1. I bought this book for $14.95 for my Kindle (I thought I'd save money with a Kindle, you know?).2. This book ENDED WHERE IT SHOULD HAVE BEGUN!I will not read GRRM anymore, cuz he ain't getting anymore of my time nor hard earned money....",0
"This is the second Aubrey/Maturin book that I have read. I did not enjoy the first one. I figured, however, that I had to give the series another try because Patrick O'Brian has so many fans. I fared no better with this one.I just cannot get into these books. O'Brian's repeated use of archaic nautical words and phrases is more than distracting. It is overwhelming and it buries the stories. I would suggest staying clear of this stuff unless you are well-versed in 18th century naval termonology.",0
"I realized they are just reselling the same bloated mess that was WoT in a different format, hyperextended for maximum cash. This isn't art folks. If you think it is I am here to tell you that you have been duped. Yeah, Robert Jordan could have been the new Tolkien. Instead he died with people thinking he was a shill. The same is going to be said here like it or not.Martin has lost the ability to write a decent story over the two decades I guess it takes to complete what, more than likely in the author's original plans, was a proper 3 or 4 book series in total. DoD is nothing more than a plodding mid-tier adventure that leaves more loose ends than it solves. Sound familiar?I bet WoT could have made a 10 book series if Jordan was an actual artist with conviction. I'm tempted to say WoT had the best original plans, a midway point between Tolkien and Martin, but RJ really flew the coop. Martin hasn't quite arrived in nutterville but he might as well be a couple minutes from town at this point.This is what happens, folks: your original, and more than probably excellent, plan for the trilogy (LOL) is force fed a bunch of 'corporate corn' for weeks. Hell, years even.... and then the trilogy simply can't cover the world building and character killing. Well, oh well right? OH NO. Now we are writing seriously and seriousness demands thousands of pages that don't have any connection to the original story but to prolong it. And then the side stories become part of the main story. And then.... barf.The printers start printing money....My advice is: don't ever get into these 'novels'. Ever. They are just another crack addiction that goes awry. I honestly don't even care that I have never finished this or the Wheel of Time. I probably will not ever pick them up again. That is exactly how much these authors have erased my memory of the good times I used to have with them. Horrible.I am also here to tell exactly how these writers function. They are not great writers, for they fear the ending of their 'baby'. Great writers continue on through their best work and keep doing other things, they keep innovating on their own style or they stop writing. Well, he may have stopped writing for a bit I don't really know, but what I do know is that Martin is now in full on 'Soap Opera' mode just like Jordan turned to around book 6 of WoT. This means he is simply wanking away whatever comes to mind at this point while following a loose structure. And while Jordan's work got him through book 6, some say to book 9, before people started to question what was going on, Martin has the detractors firmly in tow after Book 4. That isn't a good sign.And I HIGHLY doubt Martin keeps as much information about storylines as Jordan did.... meaning this will be an even bigger mess than WoT unless they can get a really good editor in here. For those that do enjoy this stuff great. No problem have a good time. But after being burned by WoT MAJORLY, I don't step into these time sinks lightly. And this one has way too many parallels to WoT. Not only that, he is running out of decent characters to kill and his world building is still second tier behind Jordan and Tolkien. I like his dialogue more often than not but I cannot support these guys who just don't have the vision required to complete their sagas in a proper timeframe WITHOUT all the egregious fat and gristle.",0
"Read this to finish the series if it continues I won't be finishing, which is unheard of for me. Story line is hard to follow and characters get stale.",0
"I really dislike everyone in this book. I'll pass on criticizing the weak writing & the obvious lack of credible research (various other one star reviews have covered that) and instead attack the characters: Jacob is a stupid d**che, Marlena is a stupid tw*t, and August is just an a-hole.Jacob is supposed to be a vet/animal caretaker but what does he do? He lets August repeatedly beat the bejeesus out of Rosie, the elephant. But as soon as Marlena, August's tw*tty wife, appears with a black eye Jacob goes bonkers and attacks August. Okay... Really?! I'm not brushing off wife-beating here, but really?! One flipping black eye and August deserves to die? I would have killed that bastard for beating AND torturing Rosie LONG BEFOREHAND!! And then Jacob keeps harping about it: ""He hit her! He hit her! He hit her!"" Well, so what? It's not like she was tied to a stake like Rosie was. And the only reason she had the black eye was because August thought she was having an affair with Jacob! And then the author uses ""paranoid schizophrenia"" to explain August's behavior? Seriously?! He's just a possessive prick! With good reason to be ""paranoid,"" turns out, since Jacob really IS after his wife.The only main character that wasn't completely unlikable, really, was Walter aka Kinko but Jacob got him killed by being *gasp!* a stupid d**che.I'm not surprised this book is so popular, though. It's a simple, easy read with little to no thinking required.",0
"I lost the plot somewhere between the strip scene, the masturbating, and the detailed sex scenes.  If you like that kind of stuff this book is for you.",0
"I'm not going to say a lot here because so many others who share my opinion have already written excellent reviews. Suffice it to say, a lot happens in this book, but none of it really means anything to the story. Save your money, wait for a copy to come up at the library, or get it in paperback; after 5 1/2 years, you can wait a few more months to read this one.",0
"Characters were constantly doing things that just didn't make any sense.  His parents are both killed in a tragic accident a week before his finals, and his professors do NOTHING to give him the benefit of the doubt on his exams?  Were incompletes a complete unknown in this time period?  (There's a lot more, but I'm trying to block it out....)  The main character himself seems to have virtually no inner life except a vague desire to get laid.  At one point he says he's interested in animals, but there sure no evidence of this.The entire first half of the book is exposition about circus life, with a long segment of gratuitous titillation thrown in.  I've got nothing against &#34;gritty&#34; and &#34;true to life&#34;.  However, I have no tolerance for scenes that are so obviously there only to sell the book as soft porn to an audience that wouldn't know literature if it hit them in the face.Characters are less 3-D than cardboard cut outs.  My dad's vague recollections of a circus coming to town when he was a kid in this time period were way more riveting.  At least they involved actual people, with real human motivations -- not characters who move from point A to B only because the author's outline said the plot had to move there.And present tense?  Throughout the entire book?  That's a device that should have been discarded in high school.  It does nothing but make me snicker at the author's obvious lack of writing talent.I had heard a rumor that this book was written as a NaNoWriMo project, and I can certainly believe it.  It seems to have been dashed off from a previously constructed outline, without any regard for building up characters and then modifying the plot if it made more sense for their motivations.  The present tense writing style is another give away that this was written in a rush and barely revised.  And the plonking in of vocabulary and &#34;facts&#34; willy-nilly -- stopping what little story there is in mid-stream -- kind of screams &#34;first draft&#34; all the way through.",0
"My hatred for this book knows no bounds. This is the trashiest thing to infiltrate the literature section of the bookstore since Henry Miller. (Although I'm not a Henry Miller expert, I'm guessing he at least brought some literary merit to the table, which is more than I can say for this author!) The depression-era circus setting, although intriguing, was not enough to make up for the endless vulgarity, flat characterization and vapid dialogue. And, to make matters worse, no character, at least from the ones I can remember, is spared horrific scenes of physical abuse - you name it, woman, worker, elephant, dog, clown. I just got tired of it all after a while.Why did I even bother to finish it? It was sort of like watching Ripley's Believe it or Not to see what kind of ghastly thing would happen next. Well now I believe it; this is one of the worst contemporary books I've read.",0
I did not like all the animal abuse.  It was just hard to read.  A very depressing story.,0
"When and if a new book in this series comes out, I'll wait for it to be available at the library, if I even bother. This book covered so many characters, most of whom I did not remember or care about. It is a continuation of book 3 and runs in parallel to book 4. Book 3 came out eleven years ago, which is too long for me to remember. This book does not wrap anything up and Martin has an annoying habit of killing the few major characters we actually care about.",0
"This book was just pointless. I feel like I was reading a novel generated by a random plot generator which spit out a circus, an old guy and a young guy-- nothing had the tactical feel of reality in this book. It was mediocre at best. Even the title of the novel was anticlimactic, given that one of old Jacob's nursing home fellows said he used to carry water for elephants and then not mentioned again. This novel is devoid of anything making it worth reading: Complex plot? No; Mercurial characters? No; Insights into the human condition? No; Stupendous vocabulary and/or Joycean constructions with the English language? No. Instead, we are left with chapter after chapter of a book better suited as children's literature.",0
"After waiting five years for this opus, I was terribly disappointed.  The story did not move along. More characters and new plot lines were added.  Nothing was resolved.",0
"I thought this story was very ""dry"" and hard to follow. I lost interest and never finished.",0
"I read all five books of GRRM's A Song of Ice and Fire in quick succession. I can only say that I was totally disappointed in ""A Dance With Dragons."" After a prologue (which at best was confusing and accomplished nothing) 71 Chapters, and an epilogue the question must be asked: ""Where's the beef?"" ""A Dance With Dragons,"" really makes me wonder if GRRM's heart is really in this series anymore. Simply put, A dance With Dragons is a one thousand page epic of dull, dragging, incestuously self-referential, clich&eacute;-ridden language, soap-opera style narrative in which nothing significant reaches any kind of conclusion. Also, that I can do without the voyeuristic sex and the explicit detail of bodily functions and parts in endless details about bowel movements, Wildling penis size, peeing, frozen snot and on and on. That type of ""gritty realism"" detail detracts from the story for me and is not necessary.The first three books were excellent. Rich in detail and well written. Then came ""A Feast for Crows."" The plot bogged down and did not move forward. Not to worry said I. Robert Jordan and Terry Goodkind experience the same issues with The Wheel of Time and The Sword of Truth series before they righted their series ships. Surely GRRM would pay heed to the criticism AFFC received and pick up the plot and move it forward at a much faster pace. Unfortunately, Not only did he not pick it up, he kicked it into the basement and plot movement ground to a virtual stand-still.Jon essentially spends 13 chapters moving the Wildings south of the Wall and worrying about food only to get the Ides of March treatment from four of his Crows. Why spend that much time developing a character only to kill him off. Well maybe now we will at least be rid of Mormonts stupid raven screaming ""corn, corn, corn,"" every other sentence. With the death of Jon Snow, GRRM has managed to kill off every character I had any feeling for. Well Catelyn is still around after her rather bazaar resurrection. So is Arya, but I have no clue what she is turning into for the Many-Faced God.Daenerys, Mother of Dragons spends her 10 chapters holed up in the cesspool city of Mereen and dithering with palace intrigues and fighting a guerilla war with the Sons of the Harpy--only she never does any fighting, just takes casualties -- for the whole bloody book, while everything falls apart around her. Well she does have several steamy bath scenes with some of her ladies...HBO ought to love them. Bold, adventurous Dany who I though was on her way to Kings Landing turned into an abusive mother who put her children (the Dragons) in chains and turned into a hand-wringing, indecisive soap opera queen.And that brings me to Tyrion who also got 10 chapters. Our friendly dwarf spends his time making cynical comments to minor characters on a boring journey in which he ends up on a sinking ship with Ser Jora who is taking him to Daenerys. In the next Tyrion chapter the slippery half-pint appears on the slave block in Mereen along with Ser Jora. Ahhh could it be that he will finally be able to ally himself with Daenerys? She could certainly use his help at intrigue. But no, the Dragon queen flits off to never never land on the back of her black dragon leaving us with several chapters of Ser Barristan agonizing over everything and nothing. He does take Daenerys husband, who is also the King of Mereen, captive. To what end we kind of never find out.Unfortunately in GRRM's world, all the good guys die only to be replaced by simpering, directionless, two dimensional, uninteresting characters that are sent on never ending journeys. If anything bad can happen to the good guys, it does. I can also do without the GREAT amount of senseless killing, rape, torture, disease, etc. that seems to dominate all of the books, but especially dominates ""A Dance With Dragons.But it's not just good guys GRRM kills off. The arch villain Tywin Lannisteralso gets deep-sixed by Tyrion leaving the plot with no real antagonist of any consequence. Cersei might have filled that role had not GRRM not use her two chapters to debase her into another whiney paranoid soap queen who spends one whole chapter walking naked through Kings Landing. I guess you could make Roose Bolton into an antagonist...he and his bastard psychopathic son Ramsay make a good pair...but other than gratuitous rape, torture and mayhem they are shallow and two dimensional. So who is left? Errrrr....The line up on the Protagonist side is not much better. Daenerys is about the only major player left from Game of Thrones. Well there is Theon Greyjoy...but he has been made over into the unheroic Reek. Then there is Bran who spent his three chapters learning to talk to trees and sliding in and out of the bodies of Ravens, his direwolf and Hodor.So after five books we are left with no clear-cut protagonist or arch antagonist.  As I said earlier I don't think this series will ever be completed. If GRRM does write another book it had better be on a 2-year cycle not a 5-year cycle.In conclusion I don't like ""A Dance With Dragons."" It was not a good read for me. I say this in the face of a large number of reviews and critiques that rave about GRRM's A Song of Fire and Ice series being ""Adult Fantasy."" I can honestly say that I agree with them as the coarse language (how many degrading ways can you say vagina), numerous rape and sex scenes, the obvious pornographic BDSM of the slaver cities certainly earn a XXX rating in my opinion. It is gritty reality at its unbest, but I can already see the HBO execs drooling over it. But to me it is a complete turn-off as was the book itself.",0
I love science fiction and I was excited they offered a few different books for free for the Kindle. I was interested in finding some new authors to read...I will not be reading this one again.I didn't finish the entire book which is rare for me. I'm an avid reader and I can read quickly- this book was like quicksand. The deeper I got into the book the more I wanted out. I couldn't finish the book b/c it was so freaking boring. I've read a lot of science fiction and am tolerant of very descriptive passages but I kept on thinking this would of been better as a movie rather than a book and that is a first for me. The author gets so completely weighed down in his descriptions- images would of sufficed! Wtf...where was the editor on this one? I really dislike rating a book poorly b/c I realize that enjoying a book is largely subjective but I could not stand this one.,0
"I feel bad giving a one star review on this because the paperback is printed very well and it looks very high class.... but this one is all Hemingway's fault. I LOVE classic books. I am an avid reader and I read books by Faulkner, Proust, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Victor Hugo in my free time. I was not assigned this and actually, if anything, I set out predisposed to like this book; that said, there were very few good things about this book. If you want to learn more about the Spanish civil war, this book might be for you - but if you care about characters, plot or writing style, this book is destined to disappoint. I can't believe I'm saying this about someone whose name is synonomous with a writer (eg. &#34;I'm no Hemingway but...&#34;), but this book was poorly written.",0
"Upfront, I must confess: I never read popular fiction, don't care for romance novels, and love classical and modern literature. I read 'War and Peace' at age eleven, and as an adolescent, devoured Balzac, Zola, Galsworthy, Hugo, the 'Odyssey' and 'Iliad', Emily Bronte, and a great deal of nonfiction, mostly history.I read TOBG out of curiosity, being a historian (specialties: Anne Boleyn's early years in the Renaissance courts of Margaret of Austria/France and how they affected her notions of queenship/monarchy; her lost portraits - reassessing a lost image). After forty years of formal (advanced degrees) and informal research, I feel compelled to write a review.What a disaster: I have no idea how this travesty was foisted upon an unsuspecting public with such extraordinary success.Let me begin by stating PG is a technically impoverished 'writer'. TOBG is rife with errors: grammatically incorrect sentences, missing commas, changes in point of view from first to third person omniscient; characters exit scenes in which they did not appear in the first place. Moreover, the 'style' - if one can call it that - is simplistic, clich&eacute; ridden, and without distinction. Modern idioms; telling, not showing; passive writing - all sins in 'Creative Writing 101', which most learn in grade school.Regarding character: PG resorts to stereotypical and old fashioned views of women: the bad (assertive/dark) girl meets a horrific end, and the good (passive/fair) girl is rewarded with true love. All rather ridiculous. What we now call the ""Madonna/whore"" complex. Mary Boleyn is the perfect lover, mother, wife, even tempered, wise, but delightfully sweet and alluringly innocent; whereas Anne Boleyn is a vicious, arrogant, not very bright, sour, manipulative, shallow, vulgar female dog, given to physical altercations. The latter's professions of being in love with Henry Percy? Impossible to believe.Katherine of Aragon, too, is portrayed as a one-dimensional character, noble and proud. Clich&eacute;. Curiously, Henry VIII is passive and easily duped by any pretty face; reduced to little more than a plot device, without a distinct personality.Beyond the above, I am deeply troubled by PG's deliberate distortion of history, and even more so by her constant insistence of erring on the side of historical facts, not fiction. This Anne Boleyn is utterly unrecognizable to me as a historian - what a slanderous, vicious, assault on a dead person. Like anyone, Anne Boleyn was a three dimensional character: brilliant, intellectual, an able politician, exceptionally loyal to family and friends, dignified, highly educated, elegant, culturally accomplished, known for her cheerful and spirited nature. But under stress, as during the protracted annulment and as queen, became short tempered, aggressive, overly intense and passionate.Of Mary Boleyn we know virtually nothing. However, PG (in a video interview) confessed to admiring her for bravely following her heart and marrying for love over her horrible family's objections. A modern perspective, a misreading of sixteenth century court mores and standards of behaviour - something she often does. PG claims there is no solid evidence for Mary's reputation for promiscuity at the French court, which I find bizarre. Franois I recalled Mary as ""una grandissima ribalda, et infame sopra tutte"", which PG downplays/denies. Anne Boleyn and the family assisted Mary as much as possible, but her rash behaviour was perceived as a major embarrassment. Henry VIII was not amused to have, as brother in law, someone from the obscure gentry.Other errors:The Boleyn - Howard family never pushed either sister into Henry VIII's bed; horrifying thought. Boleyns always MARRIED well, and virginity was paramount - any whisper of 'reputation' decreased an entire family's stock. Hence, Mary marrying William Carey, a minor noble after her disgrace in France, and it being highly improbable, even impossible, Anne Boleyn consummated her relationship with Henry Percy. Too great a risk for someone with great presence of mind.Anne Boleyn was the younger of the sisters, born c. 1501; Mary was born c. 1499 or 1500. Evidence? Anne Boleyn's first letter in French, assisted by Semmonet/Symmonet, a male tutor in the household of Margaret of Austria, which is in a mature hand; Lord Hunsdon, Mary Boleyn's grandson, supplicated Elizabeth I for the Ormonde title on the basis of Mary being the elder - to which Elizabeth, significantly, did not object.Henry Carey was not Henry VIII's son, born several years after Mary's affair with Henry VIII; Catherine Carey, the elder child, might have been Henry VIII's, but it is highly unlikely. The affair has been pushed further back into the early 1520s, shortly after her marriage (1520).Anne Boleyn never ""stole"" Mary's son, but rather, arranged a good education for him after his father's death in 1528. The paltry 100 stipend Anne Boleyn obtained for Mary is actually closer to 50,000 today. Hardly poor. And Stafford also received an income.Catherine Carey did not attend Anne Boleyn before the latter's death.Perhaps most disconcerting is PG's reliance on Dr. Retha Warnicke's legitimate historical revisionism, which has not passed the test of time. Revisionist history is best left to scholarly debate, not used as the basis of a bodice ripper romance novel. To her credit, Dr. Warnicke has vocally and publicly distanced herself from PG.George Boleyn, an avowed homosexual, in love with a man, lusting after his sister, committing incest? What? There is no evidence for a deformed foetus, incest, witchcraft, etc. in the historical record.I looked at her 'bibliography': shoddy. Outdated (Bruce - 1972), controversial (Warnicke), negative (Weir - not a historian, and unreliable), general and/or anachronistic works. Elton and Bindoff? I remember these as a first year undergrad. I suspect she skimmed the sources, and not actually read them. PG is no historian, despite protesting otherwise. Where is Dr. Eric Ives (1986)? Hugh Paget's watershed article (1981)? Only secondary sources, no primary?As for the charges, adultery by a queen was not a capital offense/treason: Anne Boleyn was accused of plotting the King's death, to ostensibly marry one of her 'lovers' after. These charges were deliberately constructed to impugn her moral character.To give weight to these ridiculous charges, as PG does, is utterly irresponsible. Cromwell and Anne Boleyn, both able politicians, were engaged in a bitter struggle over Church revenues and foreign policy. She would have struck him down, had he not struck first. The charges were sloppy and concocted in great haste - none of the dates and places matched; Henry VIII's behaviour remained curiously passive throughout, an element that puzzles historians even now. Not even Chapuys, the Imperial ambassador and Anne Boleyn's sworn enemy, believed a single charge.""Most people think the trial was a show trial, but it is an interesting accusation. Anne had three miscarriages by the time of her trial, and she was not a woman to let something like sin or crime stand in her way - she was clearly guilty of one murder. I think if she had thought that Henry could not bear a son she was quite capable of finding someone to father a child on her. If she thought that, then George would have been the obvious choice.""How grammatically incomprehensible! Three miscarriages? Three pregnancies. Not let sin or crime stand in her way? Slander; Anne Boleyn was deeply religious, in the New Faith. Clearly guilty of one murder? Not a shred of evidence. ""If Henry could not bear a son"" [sic]? Did I miss that possibility in biology? George, the obvious choice?Why this hatred of Anne Boleyn? Is PG a Catholic in the tradition of Sander, the one who created the six fingers myth during Elizabeth's reign? Well, she at least did not include that, for which deserves one star.",0
I love the series and can't wait to read the last two books.  This is my least favorite book in the series. This definitely could have been combined with crows. It is full of so much nothing and uninteresting conversation. The Danaerys character seems to be focus of this book and she is boring as ever. I really hope GRRM keeps her in  east with her dragons or kill her off. The Westeros story line and the north need to be focused on and complete.,0
"To put it nicely, this book is a mess.  It seems that the author spent all his time coming up with complicated names for minor characters and locations, and no time at all on where he taking the characters we grew care about in the earlier books.  There are very few interesting dramatic scenes, and many of those take place off-stage, we just hear about them later.  I often find myself flipping back to see if I've missed something, as some POV chapters begin by referencing things that have happened while our attention was focused elsewhere.  There are long, boring passages about various journeys, including mind-numbing lists of fleets of ships--which ones are missing, which ones are still with the fleet, which ships they commandeer along the way--no battles to speak of, they just ""acquire"" them.  I am only about 3/4 of the way through it and I am eagerly awaiting the end, not because I expect the end to make up for the total lack of story so far, just because it will be over and I can move on and read something else.",0
"As an African-American woman, I found parts of this book absolutely painful to read.  I was alternately in tears and furiously angry at Gregory's unflinching portrayal of the horrors of the slave trade and the racist attitudes of those who profited from it.  I knew there could be no ""happy ending"" in which the slave trade did not continue, and I was sad to note that some racist attitudes are still prevalent today.  As a result, I almost did not finish the book.However, the book quickly segued into a regular old Harlequin romance - improbable at best, and as one previous reviewer noted, with far too many loose ends.  I finished it, and learned from it, but I was only entertained by it in the most eye-rolling of ways.",0
"Game of Thrones is one of the rare instances where the movie/TV show is MUCH better than the book.  The HBO series trims out all the bloated, boring, aimless overly detailed fat from book.  The show is awesome.  Skip the books - especially this 5th one.  Dance with Dragons is so painful and boring, it is just not worth it when you will be able to watch the show instead.",0
I couldn't read this book all the way through.  Using GD all the time and the main character lusting after a married women. YUCK!,0
I read this after having finished the Farseer and Tawny Man series and was disappointed.  Maybe the second book will be better or maybe I just like books that take place in castles better but whatever the reason this has not struck my fancy.  I will continue so as to finish the series but I hope Hobb goes back to Fitz rather than follow these characters around any more.,0
"While I would often express my frustration at the author and the pace of the series (A Dance of Dragons taking over ten years to complete after the preceeding volume), I always thought I had the book to look forward to.  I hardly expected to be critical of the book, the author maybe, but not the book.  After all THIS was the follow up to a Storm of Swords!  One of the best fantasy books written in my opinion and which I highly reviewed for Amazon.So, no spoilers... if you have followed this series you should read this, ahm, book, that much is plain.  There are a couple of gems within in terms of individual scenes, and some surprises/answers to set questions from the earlier books.  But there is no over-riding interest factor, and two thirds of the way through the book it was clear that there was no reason to continue reading other than that I had read all the previous books in the series.At the rate Martin puts these things out, recently anyway, like one book every six years or so, I will probably not read the next one in the series, or I will wait till a day when I have the flu and it is in cheap paperback (or kindle).After ten years of waiting with a excitement, I no longer care a wit about the characters or the plots in this series.",0
"When beginning to read a series that unfolds various episodes in the lives of a group of characters, even in mystery series where the individual books are stand-alone works, one often wants to begin at the beginning. A MAN LAY DEAD, however, is an instance of a book not only at the beginning of a series, but at the beginning of its author's career, when Marsh was still experimenting with the craft of writing mysteries as well as working out how best to deploy her chief investigative character, Alleyn of Scotland Yard. (His rank varies over the course of the series, but here he's already rather distinguished and in his very late thirties or early forties. He's a character who will not age much over the next fifty years of his career.)The basic plot of A MAN LAY DEAD is fairly simple - Nigel Bathgate, a young reporter, is accompanying his well-off cousin Charles Rankin to a country house party, wherein the main entertainment of the weekend is to be a Murder Game (which, of course, features a real corpse sooner rather than later). Since the local police force is fairly small and has a few people off sick, they promptly turn the case over to the Yard, and Alleyn takes over the investigation. (The fact that some of the chief suspects ordinarily live in London doesn't seem to be a factor.) Bathgate is essentially the viewpoint character throughout, without use of Alleyn's point of view as in later books, and Marsh introduces some rather strained bits of business at times to ensure that Bathgate can be an eyewitness to parts of the investigation that realistically he should never have been allowed to see, let alone participate in. Alleyn is an interesting but rather remote figure in this story.The country house setting has about a dozen servants looking after a household whose official residents total two, as far as I can tell: Sir Hubert (a fanatical weapons collector with a hobby of giving parties) and his niece Angela, who is Bathgate's romantic interest. She's a demonic driver, and looks very good indeed compared to the female guests, who are both hangers-on of Nigel's cousin in one way or another. The other members of the house party generally give an impression of being stuffy and/or affected at first sight, while few of the servants have many scenes. Marsh in later years tended to develop supporting players more than she does here.Considered as a puzzle, the story has at least one weakness, which is that Alleyn has information about the motives of some of the suspects that isn't given to the reader. However, since the evidence about *how* the crime was committed and of the characters' movements is provided, the reader has enough to work with to attempt a solution.Considered in terms of portraying a police investigation, I don't think Marsh has been particularly realistic. On the one hand, Alleyn effectively puts the entire house party under house arrest by instructing them not to leave the house until the inquest (not, for example, just making themselves appropriately available), while on the other hand, the house isn't properly locked down and one of the servants manages to get away completely (and doesn't seem to face any consequences for having fled the scene once he *is* located). Alleyn messes around with forensic work rather than letting his fingerprint expert just do his job and *ask* for everyone's fingerprints, but on the other hand abets some illegal search and seizure at another point. As well as the standard reenactment of the crime/confront the murderer scene, Alleyn involves civilians unnecessarily in another bit of hunting with live bait that goes badly wrong.In terms of human interest that turns this into a story rather than a simple puzzle - and supplies red herrings where necessary - I *had* thought Marsh's second book, ENTER A MURDERER, was overly melodramatic in spots. I spoke without having completed *this* book, which combines some fairly believable personal relationships with incidents that try the reader's credulity. One amazing subplot - ""amazing"" as a descriptive, not a compliment - is that the murder weapon is a symbolic weapon of a Russian secret society. The reason I'm not being complimentary about this is that the society is introduced without really being made to earn its way - it could've been really interesting and colourful but fell flat. Marsh doesn't seem to have put much effort into consistently working out what she *did* use with it - it's a ""Russian"" society, but uses Mongolian weaponry and the first member of the society we learn about is Polish, without any sense of how all those elements are supposed to fit together. This kind of undeveloped gimmick isn't at all typical of what I've read of Marsh's later work, so if a reader began with this book, the reader might get a very inaccurate impression of her typical style.Drive-in totals:- Three love affairs, at least one including the viewpoint character.- One secret society with ceremonial sacred weapons and some torture.- One kidnapping episode.- Some rather prejudiced attitudes among the characters (mostly anti-foreign sentiment), with one noticeable ethnic slur.",0
"The novels in this series have always been rather slow.  I still remember plodding through The Game of Thrones wondering if it would ever get going.  Luckily, after I got through the first 100 or so pages, it did get moving and soon I was completely engrossed.  That same formula seemed to work for the other novels as well.  Some setup but eventually the story moved well.Unfortunately, not this book.  It was all setup and it had no climax!  Nothing. Sure he through in a few quick surprises at the end to try to justify the reader's time but after waiting 5 years and reading 959 pages all I can say is ""that's it?"".  I thought at least we would have had a big battle for Winterfell at the end.  Nope.George R.R. Martin has clearly become addicted to character POV's so much so that I dont think any of the main characters had more than maybe 150 pages focused on them.  Given that each had their own subplot none of them was able to get any sort of momentum for their stories.Now don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed aspects of the book.  I like quite a few of the characters and even Dany, who I loathed early on, has become more interesting for me.  But I have to say, another book like this and I won't be reading any more in this series until it is officially over.",0
"When I read a book and I keep reading and I get nothing of the main story I say that the writer is green dyeing  the grass, since I already know that the grass is green with out dyeing it, I think that I don't have to read words that doesn't say anything, for example:The Jezzie-Alex's affair could be written in five lines at the beginning of the book and five more at the end so you can understand why she was a bad agent. The book has chapters and chapters of this affair.What happened with Alex's family is part of the book, but whatever they are going to have for breakfast every morning, who cares?The trial is boring and it repeats everything you already know.... And as the rabbit I can keep on and on...",0
"I preordered the book on my kindle and hoped for the best, but was sorry I bought it. Even middle books in a series require introduction, development and conclusion, but ADWD left you with no resolution at all! People complain about ""cliffhangers"", but they are not even cliffhangers; plotlines just end and leave you nowhere. And what's with the title?  A Dance with Dragons? The dragons did absolutely nothing until the very end, and I certainly wouldn't call that a dance. The Meereen chapters were the worst: long exposition about people and politics I didn't give a fig about, endless inconsequential new characters, and Dany devolves from a strong queen to a dumb, lovesick teenager. Tyrion has lost his cutting wit and goes on a long, meandering river cruise getting nowhere. Everyone in the East was heading toward Dany, but no-one (except Quenton!) arrived. The best chapters were the ones in the North. If Martin had continued those plotlines until after the battle, we would have gotten a conclusion and been eager for the next stage. Too bad he has a fangirl editor; a good edit was what AFFC and ADWD really needed.",0
"This novel written in the twilight of Dame Agatha's long and illustrious career (1972) would have been better left on the cutting room floor.  It was especially painful for me to read because I not long ago re-read her vibrant, lively and completely mystifying ""Murder at the Vicarage"" which was written in 1927.  The comparison was depressing.Hercule Poirot is teamed with Mrs. Oliver, a crime novelist, to find the truth of a 15-20 year old murder/suicide.  Mrs. Oliver's goddaughter, Celia is the daughter of the couple who supposedly entered this pact. For the first one-half of the book, we are not advanced an inch in any direction.  Many people are interviewed (the ""elephants"" of the title) and most have vague memories of the couple, as does Mrs. Oliver herself.  Mrs. O's dithering is not artlessly charming, for we are as confused as she. Saddest cut of all, the red herrings are not ""herrings"" at all. They are giant signposts.  Rather than Poirot gracefully unraveling the mystery on the last page, the reader has left him in the dust 50 pages ago.  The prose has a distinctly purplish hue.According to the publisher, ""Elephants Can Remember"" was originally published as ""Five Little Pigs.""  I do not recommend this book, because it does not do Dame Agatha justice.  There are 75 titles to choose that will far better reflect her abilities and why she earned the title ""Queen of Crime.""",0
Just didn't like the story.  I don't think I even finished the book. Just not my kind of story. .,0
"We've entered Jordan County.If you'll look to your right you'll see a memorial to its namesake, James Oliver Rigley Jr (""Robert"" to friends and fans) who like many intrepid pioneers passed away in the midst of exploring his territory, leaving others to finish.This excruciatingly detailed landscape includes such features as a glacial plot and a travesty of beloved characters.Jordan Country is pleased to welcome its newest settler, George RR Martin.Alright, seriously...I'm torn. On the one hand, I greatly admire Martin and all he's accomplished and I sympathize with the enormous challenge a series like this represents, and nobody likes a Monday morning quarterback.On the other hand, I feel Martin may be too close to see he's getting away from what made his series great.My critique can be summed up succinctly: why did this need to be written?From what I understand, Martin was originally going to do a break in years between SoS and the upcoming books, but realized the flashbacks and backstory would be cumbersome to recap.Well...what does he thing made the first three so great? All the little scenes of backstory peppered throughout! Jaime's time with the Kingsguard under Aerys, the rebellion, Littlefinger growing up with the Tullies, all wonderful, but did we need to see it all? I get the feeling this new Martin would devote whole chapters to Tyrion's marriage to Tysha, their discovery and punishment.Like it or not, and all those who praise Martin for breaking new ground probably won't, Martin was writing to a formula. For all the wonderful complexity the basic skeleton was a simple one: three books of setup, two or three books of payoff.Greg Keyes is sometimes given the backhanded compliment of Martin-light, but he has mastered the formula in all its permutations. I cite Keyes' ""Age of Unreason"" series, and more recently, his ""Kingdom and Thorn and Bone"" series the first half (two books in AoU and three in KoTaB) dedicated to causing turmoil in the world and getting all the characters in position (and having a lot of fun too) and the last installment is all payoff.That was the formula Martin started with, but he has wandered off the track.The problem is that so much of the first three books were devoted to getting certain key characters into position, but once they were in position, we don't need to see them for awhile because we know very well nothing big can happen until those dragons are grown up.For me, AFFC worked because none of the big characters were present, and I was fine with that. There was nothing for them to do anyway.For example, I would've loved to see Bran and Arya `fully formed' in their sorcerer and assassin roles, then maybe get a couple flashbacks or descriptions of their `training' days. Bran's reveal as the green-dreamin' lord of the weirwood groves could have been an incredible climax, maybe follow it up with a few brief flashbacks in the following book...But enough what-ifs.There are a lot of specific criticisms I could level, but one stands out for me at least: what is the point of Cersei getting her comeuppance now, and at the hands of some secondary characters we don't care about? In the first three books we hated Joffrey, Cersei, Jaime and Tywin. We hated them with a passion because we saw them through the eyes of their victims, and because Cersei, Joffrey and Tywin kept getting away with it. Joffrey and Tywin got away with their rotten acts right up until the end, and then we cheered when they finally died. Martin got the maximum mileage out of those two characters. With Cersei broken and reduced to an incidental character, what satisfaction are we supposed to get when Dany finally comes along to topple her regime?Needless to say (but like Martin I'll say it anyway) ASOIAF is no longer on my `buy before looking' list. I don't shell out my money till I get a library copy first.Meanwhile, I'll cross my fingers and hope Martin can pull a U-turn and get out of Jordan Country before his epic is lost in the quagmire.",0
I read constantly and I agree with other reviewers about the excessive and un-necessary violence in this book.  There are less than 5 books in my entire life I did not finish but I finally threw this book out - it was not fair to inflict it on my local library.  The time period is definitely violent but it seemed that whenever the author did not know what to do she threw in a rape scene.  I will never purchase another book by this author.,0
"I'm astounded at how many amateur reviewers manage to hit the problem(s) square on the head, yet George RR Lucas seems to think EVERYONE else has it wrong.Dance is a smidgen better than Feast.  If not for Theon, Dance wouldn't have even garnered that much faint praise.THE BOTTOM LINE: I used to recommend this series.  I rushed out and bought Feast in hardback the first day it came out.  I waited several weeks to purchase Dance, and even then only the Kindle version.  If the next book averages 4 stars here on Amazon I may be tempted to give it one last chance--but I'm through being an agent of the word of mouth campaign; A Song of Ice and Fire has become embarrassing.I ceased reading and recommending Robert Jordan at book 4.And one last thing, I'm an adult who thinks ""adult language,"" when overused, is childish.  In the first three books Martin's abrasive language lent the series gritty depth, but in Feast and Dance it feels more like a desperate ploy to maintain reader interest.Shocking exposition won't defibrillate a stale story.",0
"Overall the series has its ups and downs; and it does inspire mixed emotions.  You climax with emotions.  I've read all 5 books in the last 3-4 months, and somewhere in the middle watched the HBO series.  The author is without a doubt a literary genius. It's obvious that the series does seem to drag out. Especially in books three and four.  Now a days why not make 7 books instead of just 2 or three ($$$). There is no doubt plain as the nose that used to be on Tyrion's face the author has been stalling. Throughout the series you can't help the feeling that there are more questions than answers as you continue reading.  The characters that you once despised you can't help but feel pity for; or should I say secretly cheer for.  Dare I say I had emotions as Cersei was taking her walk of shame. I couldn't help but thinking this would never have happened if Twyin Lannister was still alive.  Or if Tyrion was still the hand of the king.  Martin is definitely a master of suspense.  No doubt he is cleverly manipulating the reader into feeling anger, surprise, suspense, etc.OK back on track this is a review of the 5th book after all. The Author seems to be getting a second wind.  In all honesty I really have learned not to try to predict or hope for anything. JUST READ and enjoy.  I can't recall what I was hoping for from the inception of my adventure in the George R. Martin books.  I think I always wanted the Starks (remaining) to come back together to Winterfell.  Who knows?  The biggest Con of this series and any of its books is the Ocean of characters that actually have depth.  There's only so much time for one or any specific character.  So there's always going to be a feeling that you aren't getting enough of one character or the other.  That's the biggest criticism in this book and entire series.  That and the other small thing, PLOT RESOLUTION PLEASE!  There is none so don't expect any.  All in all these are the type of books that you have great difficulty putting down.  The first book is definitely better than the 5th; however, the 5th book is still quite good.  Anyways ""in for a penny in for a pound"".  What are you going to do quit on book number five.  You've already blazed through half of the series...In all honesty if there where some more plot resolution and less stalling this would outshine the Tolkien series without a doubt.",0
"The best part of this book is probably unintentional on Clancy's part.  Jack Ryan succumbs to the seduction of power and turns into a sleazy  politician.Throughout the seven Jack Ryan books, Jack has developed into  a one dimensional superhero.  By this book, his character is as thin and  flat as a piece of cardboard.  Throughout this book, he is the perfect,  honest polictical outsider, single handedly cleaning up the American  political system.  The whole time he insists he doesn't want the job.  But,  at the end of the book, once Ryan feels the power of kicking the butts of  the liberal opposition and of the Iraqis, he changes his mind and says he  will stay in office.  Ryan turns into the lying, two-faced politician he  said he hated.Besides the ending, this is mostly a miserable book. The  first 400 pages are boring and repetitive.  There some really good parts in  the middle where all these intricate subplots get going.  But most of these  subplots go nowhere or are left dangling.  There's an exciting little war  at the end, but it not enough to make up for the 1100 other pages that go  nowhere.There are some minor problems with most of Clancy's other books,  but for the most part they are very good, exciting and entertaining.  This  book is a complete shock.  It will be interesting to see if he can recover  with the next book in the series, which was just released.",0
"Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen is a book narrated by the memories of an old man in a nursing home flashing back to his life as a young vet on a travelling circus. Its based in the 1930s when the circus travelled by train into towns, to show off sideshow freaks and animal shows.What can I say about this book, it just didn&#8217;t grab me really and was a bit of a disappointment. The way it was written was very plain English and didn&#8217;t hold my attention or amuse me with the words. The talk about the animals and circus life was interesting and well researched. But the love story just wasn&#8217;t believable &#8211; the beautiful starlet falling for the pimply red headed virgin boy &#8211; nope don&#8217;t buy it sorry!I would recommend this book for animal lovers, young teens and the older generations as it has a mix from both sides of the story.",0
"This book should have been called A Dance With Nothing. Because &#34;Nothing&#34; is exactly what happens. The author flat-out admits in the forward that this book is nothing but clippings from the cutting floor of the last book. And man does it show. I can't actually give you spoilers because there aren't any. And most ironically? The dragons aren't even in the book, except for maybe four pages!Here's a summary the action in book 5:48 pages of random conversation that doesn't relate to anything.One sentence description of somebody getting killed.^^ repeat about 20 times.Seriously, there's a chapter called &#34;Dude on a Horse.&#34;The magic has really gone out of this series for me. I hope the next book is a million times better than this!",0
This story started out good in e beginning.  About halfway through it became a little disturbing.  I felt like it lost the magic from the start oc,0
"Too many characters to keep track of after waiting entirely too long for the 5th book. The book beat to death unrelated characters and bogged down in its mirco plots.  The book was chopped to pieces. Maybe Martin will be able to bring it all together, but I doubt I'll live long enough to see that happen, what with his world book signing tours and missed deadlines. Will I buy his next book? NOPE! I'm done with Martin. I paid my money for the book and I was feel I was cheated.",0
"Clancy should stick with the techno stuff.  His attempt to show the more human side of his characters flops.  Kelly, and every other character, is one-dimensional.  It is simply too trite that a man could fall instantly in love with a hitchhiker, without our having any hint of what he really sees in her, then spend the rest of the book obsessed with avenging her death.  Not that the guys didn't deserve it, mind you.  He does play with the gray areas of justifiable actions outside the law, kind of a human super-hero vigilante for whom police are probably grateful behind closed doors.  But this book has the literary depth of your average Sergeant Fury comic book.",0
"I loved the first three books of the series but the fourth seemed half a book and went nowhere (not surprisingly since Martin claimed that it was half of a book and the other half would be out in no time). After five years we get this absolutely worthless excuse for a book. Chapter after chapter introduces one or two characters, moves the plot forward infinitesimally and then skips onto the next. Half way through I realised that even if I finished the book there would still be TWO MORE to come (by 2023 given his present pace). I think that he has written himself into a corner, he has no idea of how the plot will end, if it ever will.",0
"I didn't get into the characters at all, I skipped the last 100 pages and read the last chapter.",0
"Regardless of whether the narrative is enjoyable, the accompanying maps are totally illegible in Kindle - too small, light and blurry. Especially since much of the action takes place in the East, a lack of a good map is a serious handicap.",0
"Here we have another highly-rated book which I could not finish.As others noted, it begins very strong.  But it never progresses nor develops into a story which becomes involving.  The characters are uni-dimensional.  They generate neither sympathy nor joy and they are stuck in a storytelling style which is framed in the act of ""recounting"" a multi-year adventure where the same things keep happening: The Vikings go ashore in strange places to pillage.  They then high-tail it on the sea before they are caught. Sometimes they escape, sometimes they are captured and enslaved.  Rinse, repeat.Drama, complications, character development: Nonexistent.  Humor: Rare, regardless of what the other reviews promise.  Nevertheless, it's the non-dynamic style which truly kills it.I usually give up on boring books if they don't become very promising by the 25% mark.  I stuck with this one until I'd finished 30% because it was unusual and intermittently interesting at the beginning.  But there are too many good books to discover rather than stick with something tediously written, delivering diminishing returns.While thick, it is a very shallow book which might make a good adventure movie for kids or the extremely undemanding.",0
"This book is okay if you like fighting, bickering, jealousy, adultry, and just plain nasty acting people. The circus did not play that big of a role in this book. The book concenstrates more on Jacob's personal life and his lust for the bosses wife. Jacob, now an old man, begins the book by going back into his youth to the time he was attending vet school.  Tragic events turn his life upside down and he decides to run (literally).  He winds up with a circus and becomes the circus vet, although, he rarely spent any time with or working on the animals. He just stood and watched animals be slaughtered and then felt bad that he did not do anything. I did not like Jacob. I thought he was a spinless whimp and coward. His only concern was the bosses wife and how he could get her. I must say, however, the ending was terrific! That probably was the highlight of the book. I do not see what all the excitement was about.  If you want to read a life changing book, read ""The Shack"".  Water for Elephants, in my opinion, is mostly garbage.",0
"I expected to enjoy this book, and kept doggedly reading along in hopes a plot line which made sense would appear and pull the story together.  It never did. It may be my fault as I did not read the earlier stories in this series. Perhaps I'm out of line thinking that a book should stand alone.  This one starts in the middle of events and ends in the middle of events without resolving anything.  It jumps from character to character, keeping the more unpleasant ones alive and suddenly killing off those which the reader has come to care about, to no particular benefit to the storyline.  I wasted quite a few hours reading this book thinking it would surely improve.  Wrong.  The author has talent but needs to turn his work over to an editor who knows how to weave a tale.",0
"Sometimes, a reader's expectations can greatly influence how she or he views a book.  With a name like ""Water for Elephants"", and a historical background as interesting as the Great Depression, I had expected to read a book about the difficulties of the circus life and how the historical backdrop influenced these characters' lives.  What I got instead was a sentimental love story dressed in the glitz of a historical novel, a slightly better-written version of a Nicholas Sparks novel.At the start of the book, the circus has just come to town; and that effectively got our querulous 93-year-old narrator to start reminiscing about the good old days when he used to travel with the Benzini Brother's Most Spectacular Show on Earth as a veterinarian.  As it turned out, 23-year-old Jacob Jankowski was one exam away from getting his veterinarian's degree from Cornell when both of his parents were killed in an automobile accident.  After having handled all of his parents' affairs, and after having found out that he's now virtually penniless, the grief-stricken young man walked out of his class room and hopped on the first train that crossed his path, a train that turned out to be the circus train owned by a ruthless circus owner, Big Al.  For the next 3 1/2 months, Jacob travelled with the circus as a veterinarian, taking care of the animals in the manegerie during the day and traveling from city to city by night.  It was also during this time that he met Marlena, the cricus performer who turned out to be the love of his life, and her cruel but charismatic husband, August.  The three soon developed the kind of complicated relationship that any romance reader worth his/her salt will know how it's going to turn out.The greatest strenght of this book definitely lies in the author's portrayl of circus life as they were in the early 1930's.  With Big Al, August, and Walter the midget - the author has assembled a memorable cast of secondary characters that the readers will either love to hate or root for.  Walter, in particular, turns out to be a character with much more depth than initially meets the eye, and how his relationship with Jacob evolved and developed was one of the highlights of the book.  Equally interesting was Jacob's interactions with Rosie, a mischievous elephant that ended up being the catalyst for a key event that will change Jacob's life.  I've never been a fan of the circus, but reading about Rosie's antics made me want to grab a handful of peanuts and head to the zoo.Regrettably, our main protagonists in the featured love story aren't nearly as interesting as the secondary or even the animal characters in the book.  Jacob, in particular, has about as much personality as a gnat. Throughout the book, he was grouchy as a 93-year-old, and whiny and ineffectual as a 23-year-old.  Some of the atrocities committed against the members of the circus - all in the name of survival and profit - is heartbreaking.  And yet, other than to rant and spend time sulking and moping around in his stockcart, Jacob was useless when it comes to helping his friends or even taking fate into his own hands.  Ultimately, his life turned out the way he wanted it to not because of any initiative on his part, but pure luck.  Since the book was told in first person from Jacob's point of view, the character of Marlena was even more under-developed than Jacob.  All we know is that she's this beautiful girl in pink sequin that caught Jacob's eye the day he joined the circus and from then on he was lost. There certainly wasn't enough interaction between the two to make their romance remotely convincing.  And for a book whose central theme is the great forbidden romance between two people who met at the wrong time, this is a great failure.So, in summation, if you are expecting to read a meaty historical that provides insight to what the circus life was like back during the 1930's, skip the book.  If you are a fan of Nicholas Sparks and looking for a sentimental love story to tide you over until his next publication, this may just be your cup of tea.",0
"If you like adventure, romance, suspense, and excitement... read the last third of Water for Elephants. The first two-thirds set the stage for a thrilling ending, but that's all. Although Gruen's style of writing is rich with varied vocabulary and description, the elements of the first part of the plot evoke little to no emotion in the reader. Even if the author didn't spend a hundred pages building the back-story, the strange sexual elements that rear their ugly faces every few pages completely ruin the enjoyment of reading this book. If you want to spend 300 pages wondering why you're reading this story, then pick up Water for Elephants and enjoy the most boring story you have ever read.",0
"Unlike the many readers who started this series and had to wait for years to read the next book, I bought and read the first 4 and only waited a month to read this one. I will not be waiting for nor purchasing any further books in this series.Mr. Martin put together an interesting cast of characters. He developed them quite well. I became vested in their stories. I feel like I have been betrayed by the author through the deaths of some of them. Every book loses characters through conflict, that's what makes the story more real and more interesting at times. However, manipulating the story line to make it seem that things are going one way, only to chop down the character instead, is something I feel is wrong.Throughout the series, the tenor of the books has become increasingly dark. Things have become more violent, sadistic and crude. I found that more and more disconcerting. It may be that Mr. Martin feels that this fits in better with today's society and its tastes. I hope not. I have been reading fantasy for almost 50 years. There is some really great stuff out there, but I'm done with Mr. Martin.",0
"Although the premise of the book is sound - to examine the accuracy of common food beliefs - the work is unimpressive and completely unhelpful. There's plenty of scientific research quoted, but some of the nutrition information and ""conclusions"" about various foods is wrong or terribly misleading. No matter what your interest is in reading about food and nutrition, you will be better served by skipping this book and opting for something else.",0
"Can Mr. Donaldson write?  Yes!  Is this a good book or good start to a series?  No! or at least Not for me.  It reads like some guy's rape fantasy and our ""heroine"" remains surprisingly unsympathetic.  Throughout the novel, she's portrayed as psychologically damaged (with good reason) and weak...  No heroism, no nobility, no ferocious strength... you do not root for her or any other of the main characters.  After she accidentally kills her entire loving family and then is repeatedly brutalized and raped by a fugly sociopath, our heroine's reaction is to manipulate another jerk (but a hot one) with her sexuality... her primary motivation and state throughout the novel is fear... often weepy fear.  As a female, I could not relate, i.e. where was the burning rage and absolute hunger for vengeance?  Or if not the rambette route, how about cunning & intelligence with some strategic or poetic justice? I wanted to admire Morn (or someone), but there is nothing here.",0
"I absolutely hated the ending of this series.So many loose ends...too many ""what, where who's""...enough of them to think that there will be a #6, but was bad enough to be greatful that there will not be.  I don't mind using my imagination to figure some of it out, but closure is missing.",0
"The last two books were just flat out, plain old horrible.  After reading the previous book, (and, actually, I'd started this at the end of the that book), with this book I had gotten unbelievably bored with the series, and would read the first two pages of every chapter, and, if it didn't grip me, i'd skip to the next chapter (I love my kindle and ability to quickly do that).  You would think that this would lead me to ending up at chapters where I didn't know what was going on.  Amazingly enough, that never happened!  Apparently, NOTHING happened in this book.....",0
I feel that there were too many details and story lines that needed resolution.Characters left hanging. I'm sorry that I ever started this series and I may be dead before thefinal 2 books are published. Perhaps I should create my own endings?,0
"I assume that people interested in audio versions of O'Brian's novels have already read the books. So, listening to to the book is a supplementary pleasure that can follow a great read. My rating here has nothing to do with the literary quality of the work in question. The whole Aubrey-Maturin series is superb. But if you want to listen to them I warn you to stay away from any of the versions read by Simon Vance. His are tedious, monotonous readings, in which he is unable to sufficiently differentiate the characters, with their diverse accents from around the world. For example, Maturin grew up in Ireland, and should therefore have a bit of an Irish accent. Vance can't do it.  Rather, he gives us wooden characters that makes Jack sound like a bombastic jerk, and Stephen like a mincing prig. And in his hands, Diana sounds like a silly simpering ninny. An actor, not just a reader is required. I highly recommend Patrick Tull, who recorded the entire series with consistent success and enthusiasm, as well as John Lee, who unfortunately only recorded the first 6 volumes.",0
"You will probably come to books 4 and 5 of A Song Of Fire And Ice expecting the books as good as Books 1 and 3. Or at least Book 2 (nobody expects much from ""bridge"" books so I don't think many were offended by #2). Won't you be disappointed.Frank Zappa had a fun term in the 60's and 70's for albums that were obviously inferior to the band's previous work, cranked out just to get the record company off the artist's back; he called it a ""contractual obligation"" album. Books 4 and 5 are almost the opposite and Book 5 should never have been written. The whole thing should have been wrapped up in Book 4. I gave this book one less star than Book 4 because of the way it tortured me.But the author succumbed to the lure of HBO money and so he strung out the series while lacking interesting material or story line, subjecting his readers to the worst sort of affliction any author can: boredom. Seriously, I felt like I was being punished by the end of the first third of Book 5. I had a heck of a time getting through the entire series (to date). Could 1800 or so pages (I have a Kindle so it's difficult to tell exactly) feel more like slow death? MY slow death?I guess Martin decided that replacing interesting story with sex was an acceptable strategy to fill the pages. This ramps up in each book after Book 1 as he runs lower on ideas. Let me tell you, it works as well in book form as it does in poorly written movies; sex and swearing takes the place of good plot and character development perfectly, doesn't it? That must be why movie attendance is continually dropping, the strategy DOESN'T work. At all. I'll bet a lot of viewers drop out during Season 4 and the series may be cancelled by Season 5.If you've read Books 1-3 just wait and go straight to Book 6. I guarantee you won't have missed much.",0
"I started reading a Song of Ice and Fire shortly after the third book came out, which means I had to impatiently wait years for Book 4, only to be disappointed by a Feast for Crows. But I justified it, as it was really only half a story and didn't feature my favorite characters. I resigned myself to waiting for Book 5 -- and then this came out.A Dance with Dragons finally picks up with the A-list characters again, but unfortunately never moves the story forward. I get the distinct impression that the author is just wasting time. I don't know if that's because he doesn't know where to take the plot or because he wants to milk the success of the TV show. I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt and assume the former, though as a huge fan of the series I kind of hope for the latter.The sad thing is that the book is still very well written. George R. R. Martin is a talented author and paints a fantastic picture, but the last two books do not stand on their own. Books 4 and 5 combined would have made one satisfying book (with all the pointless filler and new POV characters removed). I'm tempted to take my two books apart and rebind them myself, sans filler.",0
"I got the Audible version of this book because I was curious about its incredible popularity and wanted to see what I was missing. Having finished, I'm mystified about the huge number of five-star reviews.I don't know much about circuses so I can't comment on the quality of the author's research efforts, although I see other reviewers have pointed out shortcomings. What jumps at me, however, are the one-dimensional characters and overly contrived nature of key plot points.It's never easy for an author to pull off a first-person narrative from the vantage point of the opposite gender, and I wish Sara Gruen hadn't tried to speak through a male character. It seemed fine in the parts where he was speaking as a 90-something, but the young-man version fell flat. Often during the romantic and erotic interludes I found myself thinking Jacob sounded way too feminine.August, the primary villain, was way too over-the-top: animal abuser, wife beater, paranoid schizophrenic (so labeled by August, the main boss), etc. Why is he even part of the circus. I think the author should have established some merits, enough to justify employing him. Of course August, the owner, is just as one-dimensionally rotten, so perhaps no merit was needed.I was also appalled at the self-centered irresponsible behavior on the part of Jacob, the so-called hero, who seemed quite willing to indulge his own ""love"" needs completely mindless of the horrific consequences likely to result for his friends. I don't want to go into detail which would force too many spoilers. Suffice it to say that I strongly believe that Jacob, the narrator and main character, absolutely positively does NOT deserve the long and largely happy life he'll eventually get to lead. It's one thing to care about animals and less fortunate humans. That test, Jacob passes with flying colors. But when it comes to moderating one's own urges and balancing them against the well-being of others (all others close to you, not just Marlena, the love interest), Jacob gets a huge F-.",0
"The only good thing about this book in the series is the enjoyment I received reading the other reviewers expressing their disappointment, as well.",0
"I purchased this book based on the 31 5 star reviews. After a trip to Thailand, I wanted to learn to cook the food. I am disappointed. The format is TOO BIG 10x14""to be practical as a cookbook. Also the recipes are short on techniques--just the ingredients and basic cooking instructions. I'm donating this book to Goodwill and purchasing a real Thai cookbook.",0
"Martin insists that he's got everything under control, that plot isn't the be-all and end-all, that he is equally concerned with ""character development"" and ""world-building"", that his epic is ""resting"", as with Tolkien in The Two Towers.Really?In The Two Towers, Tolkien (the genuine article, not the ""American"" counterfeit) manages to develop plot, character, and build his world (including several races and languages) simultaneously, and while he's ""resting"", he chronicles a major battle at Helm's Deep, the destruction of Isengard and the overthrow of Saruman, and Frodo's fight with Shelob and subsequent capture by the Orcs. And all in 400 pages.This is ""resting""?Martin is not the ""American Tolkien"" nor any other kind of Tolkien. He is, if anything, the prose equivalent of Yanni, perpetual middle and no end. Those who love this kind of work -- stylistically similar to The Osbournes, The Kardashians, New Jersey Housewives, even The Sopranos (particularly if Tony had been killed during the first season) -- will likely love this, and will continue to do so as the characters, plots, venues and volumes multiply.Martin had a promising first act, but the literary world is replete with promises that quickly fizzle. Perhaps the publishers could give the series a title more fitting to lowered expectations: Westeros Housewives.",0
"After finishing ADWD, my only response was, ""That's it?"".  I love Martin's writing.  The book was an easy read, but it felt like one long bridge section building up to something that never happened.I hate to say it, but this is reminding me very much so of the last FIVE books by the late Robert Jordan.  He too could write a thousand pages of nothing and make you enjoy it.  You spend your time on what appears to be a hearty meal only to find that you've eaten nothing but filler.ADWD should have been a full meal.  It was barely a snack.",0
"Before reading this I thought that George R.R. Martin depending on the conclusion of the series could in fact be compared to Tolkien. After reading this George Lucas's handling of the Star Wars saga is a better comparison. In fact that comparison does a complete discredit to Lucas's handling and continual tinkering of the Star Wars saga.I purchased the kindle edition at midnight the night it was released and it has taken me this long to force my way through it. I can only take so much before I become so frustrated with his handling of the characters and saga or completely bored in his story telling that I have to give it up for a few weeks before getting the stamina to pick it up again. In the end not much happens. It is a feat in itself to write 1000 pages where nothing really happens. Characters that were interesting become trite, boring, and two dimensional. The new POV's are completely disinteresting and abruptly stop any momentum the book begins to build. After reading this I free I need to make an apology to all of the people over years I told had to read this series.What is the biggest problem with this series? It is apparent that George doesn't have any idea where it is going! If you haven't read the New Yorker article that came out about a half a year ago about George R.R. Martin and the series, do so. After reading that article, attending a talk/book release for Dance with Dragons, and considering the time line of releases it is clear he doesn't know where the story is going. My wife who hasn't read any of the books but read the article and attending the talk/book release came to the same conclusion. Consider this, in 5 years he released the first 3 books which were incredible. It then took him 10 years to release the next 2. It wasn't because he was getting them just right, it is because he has no idea what to right. He threw away about 300-400 pages from Dance and Dragons and redid it.This is evident in his POV's. George has written many primary characters into a dead end. He takes them to a location which has no more story or decides the main action should be taking place somewhere else so those other characters basically get abandoned. Where is Sam and Sansa? Jaime has 1 chapter in 1000 pages while Cersei and Arya each have 2. There is really no need for any of the new POV's George just needs to figure out his story for the remaining of the saga and make sure his characters are in the right place. George wrote about 150 pages of which are essentially the misadventures of Tyrion. He could have done it in 10 pages. It should have been, ""Tyrion takes a boat to Meereen. The boat gets hit by a storm. Another ship picks up the survivors as slaves which also has Mormont on board and the both get sold outside Meereen."" I just saved 140 pointless pages. What about Griff then, who cares about Griff.Midway through this book I thought that perhaps HBO by combining Feast and Dance and then using artistic freedom could perhaps salvage this saga but now being at the end I think it is hopeless. I could care less about any further books in the story nor the HBO series. If I'm HBO I'd be worried. If they attempt to follow these last 2 book no one will be watching the show by the end of the fifth season. It would take a heck of a turn around to redeem the series. At this point I'm rooting for the Others to infest all lands and kill every character.",0
"The best part of this novel is the portion in the present day when the main character is an elderly man.  His flashbacks tell a story of an impetuous and hard-to-sympathize-with attraction to a married woman and his painful experiences working for a circus under a couple of bad guys, including a sadist who abuses animals and people alike.  Throw in a fantasy-like description of an elephant's intelligence and abilities, and you can decide if it's your type of story.I read some of the good reviews to try to figure out what the draw is from this book, and I still don't get it.  It was a chore to read, and the only reason I finished it is because it is so popular I assumed I would finally appreciate something about it.",0
"As one of GRRM's first and diehard fans,I have recommended this series far and wide, even going so far to tell people the wait was worth it, which was harder after Feast, but I pressed doggedly on. Now, with a week's worth of sore wrists and neck (maybe the Kindle really is a good idea), I'm sadly disappointed. I have a vision of the HBO producers sitting around a table drinking heavily and wondering what they're going to do should they make it to Season 4, contemplating hemlock, hitmen and making a deal with the screenwriters.I won't go into many details, everyone has already done a masterful job of that, great reviews, but the main points are worth repeating: characters left out, characters cliffhanging, characters introduced that end in pointless wanderings, characters that we care about pointlessly wandering (Brienne, Jaime, Rickon, Catelynn, Arya, Bran??), hundreds of pages wasted on sailing, marching,and food. The sturdy rope that held this series together is unraveling so fast and has so many loose ends it's as if a Westerosi wind knocked over GRRM's box of index cards and he has them hopelessly mixed up. Oh, and editing...if I never hear ""I'm just a young girl who doesn't know the ways of the world"" again I'll die happy. More like, ""I'm just a young girl who wandered through 959 pages and forgot what she was doing"" describes our once-vibrant Dany.The real frosting on this soggy cake was GRRM's Acknowledgement at the end - he thanked everybody he could think of except the people he should've thanked: his loyal and long-suffering readers who've made him what he is. George, take a page from Stephen King - he never fails to think of us, he's gracious, thoughtful and kind. After the slog through this tome, you blew it big time with that lack of courtesy, pal. I deserved some of that acknowledgement and so did everyone else.",0
"I read this as a thirteen year old boy and enjoyed it.  A re-read twenty years later gave me a different perspective.  MacLeans dialogue between his characters is comic book variety at best. There are also a few glaring errors that I am surprised that his editor did not pick up on, two of note: Shaffer (supposedly from Montana) is credited with a Mid-West accent?? Montana is far west not 'mid' west.  Secondly, Nazi helicopters?  This is just plain sloppy.  MacLean should have known much better.This one belongs on the bookshelf of a teenage boy.  For a better read of MacLeans better works I reccomend; HMS Ulysess and Bear Island.  The characters are far more credible and provide a better story by far.  A poor effort by Mr MacLean.",0
"Don't bother wasting your time if you fell for the drawn-out teaser that was book Four. None of the characters you were following through the first three books and even into the fourth move along here, so there's no point in reading it. Want to find out what happens to Bran and his siblings? (Jon apparently winds up dead, killed by his inner circle. Same fate as too many other characters, ho hum) The other families? All those yarns at loose ends are just left fluttering.Yes, that's correct. No satisfying conclusion awaits and about two dozen NEW characters are added instead, as if the author got tired of the old ones from the first four books and rather move along and then wrap up their stories he just ignored them completely. Not sure which is more disgusting, the sloppy and tedious writing or the utter disrespect to the readers he's dragged along through thousands of pages previously only to arrogantly leave hanging...as if we are all going to rush out for his next book to get what we didn't in this one. Sorry. Fool me once, I might try again. But the final two books were so worthless and the quality so lacking, there isn't any point in bothering with another.Such a shame. These characters and story premise deserved an engaged writer who cared about his craft, not someone just filling pages with the same tediously repetitious situations as if he's tossing darts at a page of the following options: violent and senseless death, introduce new character, boring sex scene, gratuitous violence, introduce new character, implausible escape, introduce new character, or feast scene.",0
"After reading Water for Elephants when it was first published and then reading it again this week for book club it is no more clear than it was the first time.  The first scene describes the stampeed and then it is remembered a different way later in the novel.  Historic fiction?  Ok, there have always been a traveling circus of some sort and circus performers--that's as historical as I can get from this.  Seems like the ""break"" (no pun intended) that the author had to take between writing the first half and finishing the novel was a memory fading event.  From the reviews with so many enjoying this novel I can only surmise that those are from fond memories of seeing the circus (which we did as children in Indiana many years ago--Shriner's Circus - makes me sentimental for my Grandparents) and not necessarily this novel.  Sorry, I wanted to love this book but just couldn't get by the ""change in memory"".  I will say that the flow between old and young memories other than the biggie were pretty fluent.",0
"I will continue to read the series, but I must say it could have been enhanced had there been some glossary of the nautical terms used so profusely.  I would have expected nothing less mind you, but unlike having a good dictionary for other words, there were many terms to be found nowhere.  It can make for some rugged reading.Still, the book is worth the effort.  I am just not sure the full enjoyment is available to those who are not intimately familiar with sailing and with sailing a vessel during the Napoleonic era.And who am I to judge a book?  Because I spent money to buy it.",0
I didn't like this book...I found it depressing and the whole thing just one big sad story. One thing it changed was I will not be going to any circus anytime soon.,0
"..so says one of the protagonists near the end of the book. I know exactly how he feels.'Circus' is a good example of Maclean's late-career decline. His early tales were tightly-plotted and exciting, with plenty of action, and interesting (if not exactly original) characters. In contrast, apart from a mildly interesting plot, this book is loose and lazily written, almost as if Maclean couldn't really be bothered.The characters are little more than two-dimensional cut-outs: Bruno is the typical introverted loner hero with a tragic past, who nevertheless seems an expert at nearly everything. Maria Hopkins is an utterly clueless 'heroine' whom we cannot for a second believe is a CIA operative. And these are two of the most well-drawn characters! What about Manuelo, Roebuck and Kan Dahn? We know what motivates Bruno to act as he does, but what's their motivation? Or Harper's? Or, for that matter, Van Diemen's? We're never given any insight into what drives these characters; there's lots of shrugging of shoulders and ""we may never know why he did what he did..."". It reads like a cop-out.The writing, dialogue and descriptive passages are leaden and often lazy. For example, there is the thriller cliche of the bad guys allowing the heroes to progress so far because they plan to trap them at the very end. This does nothing except rob the book of any action or suspense, and of course our heroes easily predict the trap and dispose of the villians without breaking a sweat. The romance between Bruno and Maria is corny even by thriller standards. And while a couple of characters are unexpectedly dispatched, we never feel any real threat directed at Bruno. He's portrayed as so skilled at everything that we never believe there's a situation he can't get out of.The book's only real good point is that the anti-matter plot is interesting, and the way in which the CIA plan to use Bruno is quite novel. It's clear Maclean had a few good ideas here. What a shame he couldn't make something better out of them.",0
"This book was a disappointing read. I found it to be historically inaccurate- The Duke of Buckingham was not a close relative to the Boleyns, Mary spent time in The French Court and was a minor mistress to Francis I. She married Carey while she was Henry's mistress. Anne was the younger sister, but was not fifteen when she came to the English court; she was probably closer to 20 and was a maid of honor tho Henry's siter Mary, the Dowager Queen of France. It's almost like reading the People or Us version of Tudor history. I've tried to read a few of Ms. Gregory's novels and I have not enjoyed them. If you want a good read about Anne Boleyn, read Eric Ives'wonderful biography or some of Alison Weir's works.(Even though she is not very sympathetic to Anne.) The truth is much more interesting than the fiction.",0
"I almost didn't buy this book because of the negative reviews - I am SO glad I decided to see for myself!  This book kept my interest from the first page until it ended.  Yes, I was a little disappointed how it ended - but that's not a bad thing.  Eagerly anticipating the next book!",1
"The movie was much better, suprisingly.... It was much more concise and explained everything better. I could be biased because i like Morgan Freeman, but hey... the book was just too divergent from the main plot when it should have been spending more time explaining the how's and the why&quot;s.",1
Five stars because Tom Clancy was the very best writers of military style action. Hard to put any story down he writes.,1
"What can I say? I'm not sure why I waited so long to finally read this book. From the prologue, this book held my attention. Gruen's writing style and attention to detail is simply amazing! At several points, I felt as though I was actually watching the show or walking beside Jacob while working in the menagerie. It felt real. And the perverse, morbid sense of humor she gives Jacob as an elderly gentleman is laugh-out-loud hilarious! Although, I must admit, I found myself fuming over the treatment of our senior citizens. That, however, is a rant for another time!The characters in this book are so rich and deep. It was hard not to form some sort of fondness for them. In addition, I found it amazing that Gruen was able to turn Rosie into a full character without completely humanizing her. Even though I have a strong bond to animals, I still felt a close connection to Rosie.From a lot of her terminology, knowledge of trains, animals, freaks, etc., I really think that Gruen did a lot of research before writing this book. It makes it a lot more authoritative and realistic. While the story itself is fiction, it makes it that much more believable and credible to be interspersed with fact.I will say that the happy ending, Jacob's extreme sensitivity, etc. might be seen as extremely campy. However, I felt that Gruen was trying to find something positive during the Depression. I feel that she did try to capture that, even though there was food a shelter, life on a train circus was not good either. The Depression was hard on everyone, and no one was left unaffected. So, while there was romanticizing occurring in the novel, it felt as though she was trying to make a fairytale in an unlikely setting. To me, that makes it even more endearing and tender. Many reviews I have read complain that she is trying to push an agenda with some of the issues she tackles, but, to me, this was just a romantic love story of two people finding each other against all odds. I do, however, have to laugh a little at the ending. That part might have been a bit over the top",1
"I loved this book and didn't expect to because I've never been a fan of the circus. The novel seamlessly alternates between two periods of Jacob's life, beginning when he was in his early 20s, having lost everything after the death of his parents (the impetus for his joining the circus) and as an elderly man in a nursing home.I was especially moved by the author's clear respect for older people through her portrayal of Jacob and the other residents of the nursing home. The conversations between Rosemary and Jacob were deeply touching and I loved the way Rosemary gently explained to Jacob why the man might have lied about carrying water for elephants at the circus. Oh, and the ending was just beautiful. I was rooting for Jacob all the way!I was also fascinated by some of the historical bits such as redlighting and Jake Leg, a disease some people got (usually poor people) from drinking Jamaican Ginger Extract during the Prohibition Era. And I can't forget Rosie, the amazing elephant and where she spent her final years - This was a book I could not put down!  I guess the only",1
"The story does jump around quite alot in this book, more so than I am used to in a Clancy novel.  It is nice how it all comes together in the end but I think it could have done so with less pages.  If you are used to mainly/strictly military style writing then you might not want to consider this book as it has more of a romantic tone to it than other Clancy novels I've read, such as The Bear And The Dragon or Red Rabbit.",1
"At first glance Master Georgie by Beryl Bainbridge suggests it might be quite a light book, an easy read, a period piece set in the mid-nineteenth century. This would be wrong. Master Georgie is no safe tale of country house manners, of marriages imagined by confined, embroidering young women. Beryl Bainbridge's Master Georgie is anything but a tale of such saccharine gentility.Master Georgie is a surgeon and photographer, and the book is cast in six plates - photographic plates, not chapters. Death figures throughout. From start to finish morbidity crashes into the lives of the book's characters. We begin with Mr Moody, dead in a brothel bed, his host of minutes before in shock. Later we move to the Crimean War, where the carnage is graphic, extensive and apparently random. And even then individuals find their own personal ways of adding insult and injury to the suffering.The book uses multiple points of view. We see things Master Georgie's way. Myrtle, an orphan he takes in, adds her perspective. The fussy geologist, Dr Potter, imprints his own version of reality. And still there are less than explained undercurrents, undeclared motives which affect them all. Thus, overall, Master Georgie is a complex and ambitious novel. Though it is set in a major war, the backdrop is never allowed to dominate. The characters experience the consequences of conflict and register their reactions, but we are never led by the nose trough the history or the geography of the setting.But we also never really get to know these people. Myrtle, perhaps, has the strongest presence. She has a slightly jaundiced, certainly pragmatic approach to life. But even she finds the privations of wartime tough. Why the characters of Master Georgie are all so keen to offer themselves as support for the war effort is an aspect of the book that never fully revealed itself. And ultimately this was my criticism of Beryl Bainbridge's book. While the overall experience was both rewarding and not a little shocking, I found there was insufficient delineation between the characters and their differing motives. The beauty of the prose, however, more than made up for any shortcoming. The language created the mixed world of mid-nineteenth century politeness and juxtaposed this with the visceral vulgarities of soldiering and the general struggle of life. This rendered Master Georgie a complex, moving and quite beautiful book.",1
"After reading the hysterical prologue (""A polar bear towered above it all, slashing blindly with skillet-sized paws. It made contact with a llama and knocked it flat - BOOM. The llama hit the ground, its neck and legs splayed like the five points of a star..."") it is no surprise that this book is a NYT best seller. What is surprising is that it's only Gruen's third book - with prose like this you would easily expect her to have a dozen or two novels under her belt by now. Couple that with Gruen's attention to detail, which is reflected in her extensive research of the subject. Bet the original publisher who turned this manuscript down for lack of interest is sorry he did so. (Ms. Gruen did herself a favor in finding a new publisher!)I left the book feeling like I was friends with the characters - the cantankerous, honest yet likeable Jacob, the beautiful Marlena, the humourous and captivating Rosie. Rosie easily stole the show - as the title suggests - and you felt a special relationship with her as you went through her trials and tribulations while part of the Benzini Brothers entourage. Her behavior is nothing short of stunning and miraculous towards the end. After the circus' collapse, how can Gruen deliver after such a memorable scene? You'll just have to find out. And you won't be disappointed.",1
"I have a battered copy of Passenger to Frankfurt. I should have kept count of how many air miles it has logged with me and others I have loaned it to. This is not your average Agatha Christie mystery. It reads like a Balkan romance, only the time period is wrong. The hints of nobility, mistaken identity, and damsel in distress all combine to make entertaining reading. One is faintly reminded of the Scarlet Pimpernel by the larger-than-life hero. He wears a cape, no kidding! Part of his disguise is his outrageous dress. It is fantastical, but then any story would be that postulates the re-birth of the Third Reich.",1
"A thrilling account of the complicated life of Eleanor, the mother of Richard the Lion-Hearted and John I of England.  I should have looked up a map of Europe first to find Aquitaine.  It was a vassal country to France, located in the far southwest corner of France, near Spain.  Raised in The Courts of Love with some very sex-centered grandparents, Eleanor became the Duchess of Aquitaine, but at a young age she was married to the King of France.  She was a lusty girl, but Louis was not a lusty man.  As the second son, he was slated for the church and had to be recalled from his monastery when an accident with a pig caused the sudden death of his older brother.  As Louis preferred to spend the nights kneeling beside the bed in prayer, Eleanor was extremely frustrated alone in her cold bed, but the couple did manage to produce two daughter, the second was conceived when the Pope put the couple to bed in a specially prepared room and bed sprinkled with Holy Water.  Since girls could not inherit the French crown, a divorce was agreed upon on the grounds that Eleanor and Louis were too closely related.Next stage of the story:  Very soon thereafter, Eleanor and 17-yr-old Henry, son of Matilda, heir to the English crown, jumped into bed to start a torrid love affair. They were soon married, and Eleanor hit it off with Henry's mother, Matilda, a formidable woman who had led an army to take the English throne away from Stephen, a cousin who being male had usurped the Crown.  The civil war ended with a document naming Matilda's son Henry as the next king when Stephen died.  Soon Eleanor, former Queen of France, was Queen of England.  Male heirs were no problem for Eleanor and Henry:  William, Henry, Richard, Geoffrey, and years later John joined the family, interspersed with enough sisters to make marriage agreements with most of the monarchs of Europe.  As happened with so many royal children, William was born sickly and passed away in childhood.  Henry became the heir, and also became his father's favorite.  The marriage started to crumble when Henry, the King, brought a bastard son, Geoffrey, to the nursery and demanded that he be raised with the legitimate offspring.  Eleanor now realized by the age of the new Geoffrey that Henry had not been faithful to her from the beginning of the marriage.  She began to fall out of love.  As the father put all his pride and attention on Henry, even having him crowned as the young king during his childhood, Eleanor put all her love and hopes on the next son, Richard.  Richard was a strikingly handsome young man, tall, well built, with reddish blond hair. John was rejected by Eleanor at birth.  She was tired of having babies.  She was estranged from Henry.  She had made Richard her heir in Aquitane.  Henry had divided his possessions between Henry and Geoffrey.  There was nothing left for John, so Eleanor decided he should make the church his career.  She got a wet nurse and sent him off to a monastery, along with servants and Joanne, the sister closest to John in age.  The king called John John Lackland because there was nothing to give him.  John was a small baby with dark hair and was not appealing to his parents.This is a gripping tale, and I will not spoil it for the reader.  How does Richard, and then later John, receive the crown of King of England?  What happens to Henry and Geoffrey?  Is the depiction of Richard and John in Robin Hood correct?  Is Richard worthy of the name Richard, the Lion-Hearted?  What happens to Eleanor after she falls out of favor with Henry?  What became of Aquitaine?  How about Luis, did he ever have a son?  This story tells all in the vivid manner of Jean Plaidy.  This is truly a book you won't be able to put down.",1
"I loved this book. I loved the circus atmosphere and the story. It was exceptionally well-written, and I enjoyed every page.We have a vet student joining a circus, with mistreated animals he's frantically trying to save and protect. We have a lovable elephant. The narrator is an old man looking back, and he recounts his tale in the immediacy of present tense as he describes situations that happened decades earlier. Interesting, and very effective choice, to write in present tense throughout.The ONLY thing that keeps me from giving the book five stars was the lack of character development for Marlena. Throughout the story I understood the protagonist loved her, but she seemed to be the woman tied to the railroad tracks throughout - Nell being constantly tormented by Snidely Whiplash - and I never really got a sense of her as a person. Maybe I missed it (not surprising - I read the book in daily spurts while I walked a treadmill), but I didn't even know how old she was. I got a much clearer picture of minor characters, like Rosemary, Kinko and Camel, than I ever did of her.I also never understood the whole ""water for elephants"" thing that the protagonist railed about in the beginning of the book. Perhaps it was something else I missed.Nevertheless, I loved the book, I loved the ending, and I know I'll go back to read it again.",1
"Okay I know that Gibhran is supposed to be corny and cliched and assosciated with the hippy movement of the 60's.It does not mean that he also isn't still relevant to anyone seeking answers to what life is about. The set up is simple - as a prophet takes his leave of the people with whom he has stayed for many years, he is asked a series of questions, ""tell us of friendship, of love, of work, of death"". And to each question the prophet provides an answer.For me the message that the prophet provides is that life is not easy and that the greatest joys can only be achieved by risking and enduring great sorrow.But that is only what I took from Gibran and his prophet. Read and take your own message from his words.",1
"I read this book only because it was on my book club list. I had passed it up many times in my search for a ""good"" book to read. When it came time to read it for the book club I was not looking forward to it. All I can say now is WOW!!! I would have missed a great ride had I not been ""forced"" to read this WONDERFUL story. By the end I was cheering! I have since recomended it to many people and they all have had the same reaction. This is a keeper!",1
"A beautiful book. So wonderfully written that savoring the words was a joy, never mind the sensitive yet powerful story. Though the topics -- deafness, World War One -- suggest a very grim work, it ends up being a powerful affirmation of life.This book deserves to be much more widely known than it is; it's an excellent example of how even good books deserve ample promotion, as I think that it's a lot better than some major recent best-sellers. I was pleased to see in a bookstore recently that it's won an award.",1
"easy to write reviews on Agatha's Poirot books... they are all excellent. This book is an early premise of the wave of psychologic thrillers with those people with apparent personality disorder. As somebody mentioned before, Agatha did it all in her time.",1
I consider this book one of the greatest books ever written. Sometimes I had to put it down as it was too hard to take the awful events of World War II. I loved it.,1

"Totaling nearly 2,000 pages of small print, Herman Wouk's The Winds of War and War and Remembrance can be compared to War and Peace in its immense scope.  Together they tell the story of American naval officer Pug Henry and his family, religion historian Aaron Jastrow and his niece Natalie, and those they encounter during the period leading up to World War II (The Winds of War) and the War itself (War and Remembrance).  Historical characters mingle with fictional ones in richly drawn settings from pre-war European cafes and embassies to the Oval Office in wartime Washington.  We accompany them on air raids over German and in submarines in the Sea of Japan.  Readers look into the poshest clubs in Singapore and Honolulu and the most depraved setting imaginable - the German death camp of Auschwitz.  Even some of Wouk's numerous minor characters are capable of riveting his readers' imagination.  Under the war's pressure, the leading characters undergo great change, and the reader will be kept in suspense until the very last page to see what becomes of them.In addition to a taut, thrilling narrative, the books present fascinating examinations of political, military and philosophical history as the characters struggle to make sense of their quickly changing worlds.  As the story progresses, religion plays an increasingly important role.  Wouk is an orthodox Jew, and his Jewish characters in particular wrestle deeply with their identities.  Discussions between characters involve the nature of European history, the Jewish people, how Americans see the world, and how the world sees America.  The historical research that informs these discussions is truly impressive (at the very end Wouk makes clear the degree to which the story is fabricated, and it is surprisingly slight).Besides relating numerous military (particularly technical ones) aspects of the war, Wouk takes a hard look at many aspects of American and allied policy, raising questions still unresolved regarding many controversial policy choices.  He also strives to explore and explain the German mindset and viewpoint, using devices such as a fictitious German general's war memoirs to great effect.  Wouk uses his characters and dialogue to explore in great detail how something as terrible as the Nazi regime and the Holocaust could have happened - how a supposedly civilized advanced European state could have perpetuated it and how supposedly civilized, advanced nations could have allowed it.  Technology also plays a vital role in these stories - both good (e.g., sonar) and bad (e.g., those involved in the extermination of Europe's Jews) and one of a much more ambivalent nature: atomic power.There are minor flaws in these works to be sure.  Pug Henry can be a little too omniscient when it comes to military affairs.  This is best understood as necessary to his role as narrator and voice of the author rather than an accurate portrayal of a naval officer.  Digressions and technical discussions become more common and longer in the second volume and the battle analysis in the fictitious German ""memoirs"" can drag, slowing the riveting narrative.  Of course, what might bore one reader may captivate another.In sum, there is no more enjoyable and engaging way to explore the events that shook the world from the mid-1930s until the end of World War II than reading these two masterpieces.  While not every book can ever appeal to every reader, these come as close as possible.",1
"Historically correct or not, I loved this book.  The story of Mary Boleyn and her affair with King Henry VIII and her sister's subsequent marriage to him is one of the most intriguing book I have read in years.  Despite its length it was a quick read and a page turner.  I had owned the book for many months before picking it up to read because I have been so busy that I was afraid that it was so long that it would take a long time to read it (after all my subway commute is only 20 minutes so I cannot fit too much in) but it really went amazingly quickly and I found myself reading it every spare minute I had. I liked the way it was divided by seasons and the attention to detail of where the court of England was at a particular time.  This book gave me more insight as a social commentary than any other book I have read.  Women are pawns politically, religiously and socially.  This is a must read for anyone interested in the period.",1
"Now, like most other Song of Ice and Fire fans, I am willing to admit that the last entry in the series,A Feast for Crows (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 4), was not my favorite and that it got me worried that Mr. Martin had gotten a little too ambitious in his storytelling.  This latest entry has restored my faith that he knows what he is doing.  Taking us back to just after the end ofA Storm of Swords (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 3)and continuing the stories of characters who were left out of the last entry (Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, Bran Stark, etc.),A Dance with Dragons (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 5)comes back to the most interesting characters and storyline in the entire series, i.e. the Wall and Daenerys' rise to power.  Like all of the previous novels, all of the characters are well fleshed out and engaging and Mr. Martin's patented cliffhanger chapter endings always leave you wanting more.  And knowing what happened in the last entry helps make this one all the more enjoyable (not knowing what was going on elsewhere was one of ""A Feasts"" biggest problem, I felt).  The wait for this fifth entry was well worth it.  I will say that I still fear that Mr. Martin has become too ambitious in his storytelling and I fear that he won't be able to finish the whole tale in two novels after this.  But, however many novels it takes, I will enjoy them just as much as I have enjoyed this one.",1
"Many writers of historical fiction start with an actual event in history, and then let their imaginations run free. This fascinating book shows great imaginative restraint. Certainly there are fictional threads running through the tale, but Mr. Dobbs seriously wants to tell us about Neville Chamberlain's politics of appeasement, a policy that ended with his downfall as Prime Minister.Throughout the book we are a fly on the wall listening to the political machinations of the principle characters in the story which include, Chamberlain, Churchill, Ambassador Joseph Kennedy, Lord Halifax, the traitor Guy Burgess, and many others. It is fascinating to see Chamberlain's party struggle to hold on as their political capital steadily declined. Churchill, on the other hand starts as an outcast, one who continually cries out that peace with Hitler is an unattainable goal. His rise to First Lord of the Admiralty, and then to Prime Minister is a long fight against the odds.I am a history buff who's read books on WWII and English history, and this book taught me many things that I didn't know. Now I've said that this book fascinated me, the almost 700 pages just sped by, but I must say that this book may not be everybody's cup of tea. It definitely is not a wartime thriller. The novel is full of conversation, and as for action you'll have to settle for walks through the garden of Buckingham Palace with Lord Halifax, and King George VI (who, we find out, was so tongue tied that it was difficult for him to make clear statements).",1
"Gregory is a true artist.  The story engages the reader from beginning to end, with twists and turns, plots and undertones.  I couldn't put this one down.  Although fiction,the book is filled with historical citations and questions that have never been answered.  The book is thought provoking, and offers a well painted portrait of 16th century life.  Gregory has once again created a moving novel.",1
"I had some reservations about reading this novel, as I am not a history buff, and I could not see myself wading through over 600 pages of middle English dialogue and melodramatic prose. I am so glad I took the chance.Told in the first-person narrative of Mary Boleyn, Anne's younger sister, this is a fictional aacount of a family of courtiers in Tudor England. The novel begins a little over a year after Mary (aged 13) has been married to a British nobelman. All sorts of things are happening for her. Her family is gaining power within the monarchy, she is reasonably happily married, and her older sister Anne is returning from the French court. Mary has caught the eye of Henry VIII, much to the Queen Katherine's chagrin. Pressed by her family, and in particular her sister, Mary begins an illicit affair with the king. Two children later, Henry has moved on from Mary to her sister Anne. The story then shifts to Mary's first-hand account of her sister's reign and eventual execution.Make no mistake; this is definitely Mary's story. While a great deal of the novel is spent on Mary's version of what happened to Anne, there is no loss of who Mary is as a person and of what happens to her life. I highly recommend this novel as it paints a rich characterization of one of the most fascinating and tumultous periods of English history, with a plausible plot and witty dialogue. Gregory has deftly captured the ruthlessness and greed of the noble class, and paints a particularly ambitious portrait of Anne Boleyn.As we read how Mary matures, we suffer with her, especially during her adolescent phase. It's difficult to discern if Mary is a worthy heroine, or a complacent whiner. Good! Just like a teenager. We see her through her first love, the births of her children, and finding true love. There's not a false notion here. For fiction, this is unparalleled. Great fun!",1
wow - had to skip entire chapters and nothing much happened in the book other than dragons growing larger. If GRRM is not careful the Dragons might die of old age and then he will have an other Kong to deal with.S,1
"Our book club read this and everyone absolutely loved it!  A common comment was that this was a book that ordinarily we would never have chosen on our own.  I am not a history buff and so the setting threw me off a bit.  However, along with everyone else, I was very surprised that the book took off soon in the beginning and I couldn't put it down.  I can't wait for the movie and can't wait to read another.",1
i think this book is similar to  the timetravellers wife as it jumps back and forward  not a real favourite of that type storyline,1

"Upon my discovery that ALL my neighbors are practicing Luciferians/Satanists, I ordered a different book by Dr. Burns and given she is so thorough in her research, I ordered this one as well.

Sure I thought my neighbors were a bit &#34;off&#34; but it seems so many people are &#34;off&#34; these days I stupidly excused and rationalized their behavior.  Then, about a year ago one of neighbor ladies said her grandmother had been an Eastern Star.  End of the story?

"This is the second book and, like the first, is named for the rank Capt. Jack Aubrey, RN, obtains in the course of the book.  The road is very rocky to get there, however.  First peace breaks out between adversaries England and Napoleonic France (no hope for a promotion there, and scant hope of even being given a ship to command).  His prize agent (sort of a banker) is caught in a Ponzi scheme and flees, leaving Jack hopelessly in debt.  When war is resumed, Capt. Aubrey is on the wrong side of the English Channel.  When he is finally offered a command (still at the Commander rank), it's a sloop of experimental design and dubious quality of construction.  Worse, Aubrey is placed under the command of an admiral he had previously cuckolded and with a crew consisting mostly of landlubbers and jailbirds.  However, Aubrey's negotiation of these treacherous positions is child's play compared to the romantic attentions paid to him by two women of entirely different personalities.  To complicate things, his best friend Dr. Steven Maturin is equally smitten with one of the ladies.With this book, the world of Napoleonic Europe comes to life.  The details of life asea and ashore are as fascinating as following the adventures of the two protagonists.  As we'd expect from an O'Brian novel, the reader is absorbed into the story, but might be hard-pressed to say why, exactly, the book is so enjoyable.The romantic subplot is fascinating, if somewhat Austin-esque in its soap-opera qualities.  I was never convinced that Steven could be so besotted with his love interest - she is cold, fickle, and indiscretionary in her flirtations.  The busibody mother/aunt of the two ladies is also a carricature of a Jane Austin character, and I was never quite sure if O'Brian was offering this subplot as a sort of satiric comic relief, or if this was an accurate picture of upper-class life in the time period.  Don't get me wrong - it was fun and still enjoyable to read, but the highlights of the book definitely take place aboard the ships, especially when cleared for action.Overall, I think I enjoyed the first book better, so I'm demoting this one to 4 stars.  It's still a great read, and I'd recommend it without reservation.",1

"Sidney Sheldon is one of my favorite authors, and you won't be disappointed. This is a great book and one you shouldn't miss.",1
"Just hoping that this picks up a little in the next book - the tricks are getting a bit old. Still, entertaining, which is the point. A little more graphic and violent than needed - bring back the politics!",1
"I enjoyed these books, three and four lagged a bit to me but the pace picks up again in book five.  Really book one is the best.  Not great literature for sure but entertaining and something to do at 3am when you can't sleep.  If you enjoy dragons, tree spirits, and little people well spiced with some graphic violence and a bit of sexy stuff you will probably like this series.",1
"James Patterson is well-known for his popular Alex Cross series, and Along Came A Spider is the first installment introducing Alex Cross, et. al.  The story opens with a prologue regarding the infamous kidnapping and murder of the Lindbergh baby in 1932, as explained through the thoughts of the 12-year old kidnapper.  It then jumps to 1992, and introduces Alex Cross, who is a brilliant Homicide detective and psychologist, his partner, John Sampson, and his delightful grandmother, Nana Mama.  As the story unfolds, Alex and his partner are called to a triple homicide scene where a mother, daughter, and 3-year old boy have been brutally murdered; a similar murder has just previously occurred, and Cross suspects this is just the beginning of a rash of serial murders in the poorest part of town targeting blacks.  Cross is determined to solve the murders, even though those in management at the police department regard these murders as unimportant because they involve the poor.  While at the murder scene, Cross is called to a private school where a famous actress' daughter and the son of the Secretary of the Treasury have been kidnapped by a man posing as a teacher at the school, Gary Soneji.  Cross is told that the kidnappings are high-priority, and he resents the fact that two rich kids take precedence over six murders of innocent, albeit poor, black victims.  Patterson does an excellent job of merging the two scenarios as Cross investigates and works to solve both of the crimes.For those unfamiliar with the Alex Cross series, this book is the one to read first; it explains the background of the characters while weaving them through a very suspenseful tale with many unexpected twists and turns.  Patterson makes the characters seem believable and real; readers will be kept on the edge of their seats, and will admit that the only drawback of the novel is that it ends.  Most suspense/thriller aficionados will waste no time picking up the next book in the series.This book was purchased with personal funds and no promotion of the book was solicited by the author or publisher.",1

"First off, I am not a literature expert and do not claim to know all the finer details present in this book.  What I do know is that as an engineer, I enjoy reading, especially classics, and this book has given me confidence in Hemingway as one of the best authors in American literature.My first and only experience with Hemingway before was &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; in high school. Part of the problem may have been in high school, but I was honestly not impressed.  However, since that time I watched the movie &quot;In Love and War&quot;, I have found Hemingway more interesting, but still didn't have time to read him until I found &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;.  I think this book is just fantastic. The detail that goes into this narrative makes the book hard to put down and very full of meaning.The conflict that the hero, Robert Jordan, goes through internally, externally, and mentally form the basis of what has to be one of the best character studies I've seen in a novel.  I also find the historical perspective quite fascinating as a person who enjoys history and culture.  The Spanish Civil War is something that is overlooked in our education, and I find that even the fictional account here gives insight into the larger issues faced, even if the story is focused on the inner conflict of the main character.This book really shows the inferiority of modern novels and will definitely drive me to continue to read Hemingway.  The only question is what next.  I can't imagine anything being better than &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;.  My only complaint is in the style of the ending.  While it serves an interesting purpose, I don't feel it quite lives up to the quality of the rest of the book, but the concept is fantastic.",1
"A new president, a commercial airliner crashing into a landmark Washington DC building, a fight against bio-terrorism on US soil, and a madman in the Middle East hiding behind Islam as justification for his actions.  Sound familiar?  Published over five years ago, Tom Clancy's &quot;Executive Orders&quot; has eerily become in many ways an unfortunate reality.  Simply put, one may never be able to consider a Clancy novel a pure form of escapism again.But despite the unsettling nature of the novel in light of recent events, &quot;Executive Orders&quot; is an engaging and informative read.  Readers may feel like they are getting an inside glimpse of the White House as Clancy super-protagonist, Jack Ryan, reluctantly ascends to the Presidency of the United States.  Clancy's knowledge on a wide variety of topics and his ability to keep dozens of narratives afloat in this 1,300+ page novel is truly amazing.  The sheer thickness and complexity of &quot;Executive Orders&quot; definitely calls for some perseverance - but for the most part it is worth effort.",1

"I love this whole series. Yes, there are a lot of characters to keep track of, but the story is about a war of seven kingdoms, so I think that the amount of characters keeps it realistic. Martin does a good job of reminding us who these characters are (if we tend to forget) thorough conversations with other characters. I was also very happy to see that my favorite characters were back- tyrion, jon, arya! Can't wait to see what happens on book six!",1

"Page 162/163 shows a man holding up a little puppy as others look on including one smiling, he is staring right into the puppy's eyes, while the decapitated carcass of another dog is right next to him. It says in the description that it is part of Cantonese ""culture"" to feed puppies with white rice for nine months and then butcher them. I want to make a point that any person who can stare a little puppy in the face and then butcher them during non-famine times is not a human being. This is barbarism, pure and simple. I really like Asian people but they can't hide behind ""culture"" and expect everyone else to keep quite, the same goes for everyone else. This is the 21st century, not the Middle Ages. Every group of people on the planet need to change for the better, not make excuses for backwardness.",1
"A great collection of the recipes that gave French cuisine its international fame is awaiting you in this book. Don't allow yourself to be intimidated by the excellent pictures, and try some of these traditional  dishes. The vast majority of the ingredients can be found in the United  States. Just make sure you take your time to enjoy this wonderful food, as  the French take theirs to make meal taking an amazing experience.",1
"George R. R. Martin's A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE saga continues with the much-anticipated fifth in the series, A DANCE WITH DRAGONS. For those not familiar with the series, these are the books on which HBO's Emmy award winning television series, GAME OF THRONES, is based. (The first book in the series is titled, A GAME OF THRONES.) Martin's series is peopled with what I consider to be some of the best characters in modern literature. These are multidimensional personalities with genuine emotions. The villains are not evil through and through, and no hero is without blemish. This, along with the fact that Martin is utterly vicious to his characters, leaving the reader with the feeling that no one is safe within these pages, makes these volumes a must read for anyone even remotely interested in the fantasy genre. That said, A DANCE WITH DRAGONS is not flawless. Even for the initiated the first two hundred pages can be quite confusing. Martin doesn't give us any reminders as to where any of these characters left off in previous volumes. Many of the most loved characters were not in book four, A FEAST FOR CROWS, and so their plot threads date all the way back to A STORM OF SWORDS, released in 2000. My memory just isn't that good. I would have enjoyed the story much more if there had either been a recap prior to the beginning of the story, or at least some explanatory dialogue to help refresh the reader's mind. Even after completing the book, I'm still not sure what Tyrion's goal was at the onset of the story. All this to say that once I got into the flow of the story I couldn't pull myself away from it. Martin is masterful when it comes to interweaving plot lines, deceptions, betrayals, lost loves, and fantastic action and suspense. Much of the focus for nearly all of the characters falls on Daenerys Targaryen, the would-be queen of the seven kingdoms who is now the ""Mother of Dragons."" Everyone either wants to manipulate, use, or defeat the young woman with a will of fire. And though she is the focal point for so many, she is unaware of the scheming and infighting across the sea to the lands which she may one day rule. Readers beware, there are some significant shocks in the second half of this tome, and they are very well worth the wait. If you've read the previous four volumes, your wait will be well rewarded. If you've never read this series, I encourage you to get started with A GAME OF THRONES. You won't regret it.",1
What a GREAT book.  Never saw the movie until after and I am glad of that.  The book was amazing!!!,1
"I have read all five of the Game of Thrones series. I actually read read them in a row after i had watched the first season on TV. If you like a good mix of fantasy, wonderful characters,old historical times and pure adventure- you will LOVE this series. Martin is a master story teller. I can't wait for the final two books!!!",1
"In this book Gregory tells the tale of the Boleyn family and there ambition to become prominet in the court of Henry VIII of England in the 1500's.  The tale begins with the youngest of the Boleyn girl's Mary.  When her family discovers that the king, who is frustrated with his current wife Katherine because she is unable to give him a son, is taken with Mary they push her to pursue the relationship eventhough she is barely 14 years old and already married.  The Boleyn's hope to gain power and money through this relationship and hope that Mary can succeed where the queen failed by giving Henry a son.  Mary has two children with the king, a girl Catherine and a boy Henry.After Henry is born Mary's family encourages her to try to get the king to divorce his wife who has gone through menapouse and can no longer have children and marry her.  This way her family will be the family of the next king of England.  However, all Mary wants to do is be with her children who have been sent to her family home and while she is away Anne takes her place and catches the eye of the king.  She claims she does this because she does not want to see the king turn his eye to anyone else in the court but when Mary returns from her family home the king has cast her aside for Anne.The rest of the book centers around Anne's rise and fall from power as seen through Mary's eyes.  Anne will stop at nothing in her quest to become queen be it murder or manipulating the king to get the church to grant him a divorce.  Once she is queen she continues her power games stoping at nothing to try to have a son with the king.  When she is unable to do this the King casts her aside much in the same manner he did the queen for someone younger.  During this time Mary's reunites with her first husband who ultimatley dies and she marries another man for love against the wishes of her family.Overall this story is well told.  I could not wait to find out what happened next and thus found it a quick read.  Gregory does a good job with her charcters making them interesting and lively.  She succeeds in giving a new perspective to a famous period in history and creats an engaging read in doing it.  Highly recomended.",1
"The story generated lots of good discussion.  The juxtiposition of the main character in youth and old age benefited both story lines, neither of which would have been as compelling without the other.",1
"I now own four books from the ""Beautiful Cookbook"" series.  This is by far my favorite.  The food stylists and photographers for this particular book have raised the bar to a dizzying height.  This melange of simple and upscale recipes is presented as down-to-earth...Texas-style.  You can almost smell and taste the beautiful food.  The stylish photos are works of art.The recipes range from the traditional basics to ""new Texas cuisine.""  Try to imagine a chilled ""Cream of Tomatillo Soup"" served in a bowl of ice...with edible flowers and herbs encased in the ice.  (The ice bowl is easy to make!)Does ""Hot Crackered Texas Crab with Pecans"" sound good?  Or ""Chili-and-Cheese Corn Husk Muffins with Pumpkin-Seed Topping""?  What about ""Chorizo-Stuffed Poblanos with Mango Salsa"" or ""Texas Hot-Pepper Shrimp with Avocado Salsa""?  And for dessert, how about ""Churros with Cinnamon-Pecan Ice Cream"" or ""Blueberry Creme Brulee with Rose Geranium""?I could go on and on about the food and the presentation.  These tempting and colorful dishes can all be made by the novice cook who enjoys the preparation.",1
Very good could not stop once I started.  Looking forward to the next book in the series.  Many topics rolled into good story,1
"War and Remembrance and Winds of War are the best examples of historical fiction I know of; both of these books should be required reading in high school when students learn about WWII. The only thing missing is a companion reader that would include maps of the campaigns, battles and engagements along with some other short narratives of the events.",1
This book is hard to put down.  Another great Alex Cross adventure.  His whole family is so interesting.  Plot keeps you guessing.,1
"Oh how I loved this book! The story is told by its main character, Jacob who is now confined to a nursing home, reminiscing about his time spent in the circus. It tells of Jacob's life travelling in a circus during the Depression and of the harsh conditions for the workers in during this time. There are so many great characters in this novel that have great depth to them, including Rosie the Elephant. This is much more than a novel about the circus, it has a great story that everyone should do themselves a favour and read! I'm looking forward to seeing whether the movie can capture just what a truly captivating story this novel tells. Highly recommended.",1
"I know there are hundreds of reviews for this book, but I liked it so much, I just had to add mine. I usually read a book before seeing the movie. I fing that the book is generally better than the movie. This book was amazing. I felt like I was living in a real circus. I am also a nurse, so can identify with the main character in a nursing home. Nursing home people are so very lonely. anyway, this is a real story, like the ones you were told when you were young. It took me back and made me feel like I was truely there. You have to read it. Maybe I'll see the movie now.barbara",1
this book series is amazing i enjoy books like these i love how this book series started i can not wait till books 6 and 7 get released GRRM and GRRM is one amazing author i give him alot of credit for making this amazing book series!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
"I was captivated by this book. The bits of historical data mixed with fiction made the story seem more authentic.The tale is told by a 93-year-old man in a nursing home. His recollections lend to the authenticity of this story. At first, it seemed like this had been a real relative of the author. When I realized that it was not, I was amazed with the author's creativity.",1
"I had no anticipation of what to expect when I began reading Water for Elephants.  The most enlightening aspect of the story was the education I received about the hierarchy of employees within the circus.  From an outsider who has always been taught (but never believed it) that people in the circus where of lower class than others, I had no idea there were different ranks of people within the circus.  Life behind the scenes at the circus was crude and inhumane.  From the beginning the book was colorful with characters.  The transitioning between the past and the present with the main character was an interesting transition.I try to approach a book with an open mind and throw other opinions out the window.  I am pleased I have done this because the people that I know who have read this book have ranged from horrible to excellent.  I found this book entertaining and engrossing. It was never a book that I just could not put down, but I enjoyed read it.  Because the era in which the reference of the circus occurred the comparison of food lines and the great depression was evident.  Although the inhumane treatment of the people and animals undoubtedly occurred during this time period, it wasn't easy to read it.  Although the hierarchy of the class of people was evident within the circus, it was not unlike how society actually was during this time period.  The author clearly did research to solidly base the sad realities of the treatment of people and animals during the depression era.The author weaved a story with vivid characters and animal characters in a sympathetic and favorable light.  Sara Gruen's engaging ""Water for Elephants"" is an eminently American work, set in the depths of the Depression and featuring a broken-hearted young man whose unplanned existential leap of faith catapults him into a chaotic and unknown way of life. Jacob Jankowski discovers his untapped reservoir of courage, conviction and compassion, and in so doing, he, in every manner of the American definition of the word, emerges as a hero. ""Water for Elephants"" is a triumph -- of a writer fully in control of her craft, of a character resolute in his determination to discover life and of a depiction of ideas that truly embody our national character.After all of this being said, I am on the fence as to whether this book lives up to all the buzzes and even deserving of being made a movie.  There is nothing more satisfying than when you finish a book and you feel like you also were part of the adventure.  I do not regret reading this book, I only wish it was more engrossing.",1
"For those with a self hurting desire to know the whole horrible truth about the bloody act of social engineering known to history as The Holocaust, this book is one of the best eye opening and stomach churning works on the subject.Having such a desire, this was one of the first books on the subject I purchased and read from beginning to end.It was very painful to read. Every horrible event well described without being graphic or  overdone. Better than  diet pills for killing one's appetite. All the horrible things that happened.How did something as this happen?Read this book and learn.",1
"The first half of the moving moved along smartly, but then the story bogged down and after slogging slowly through about 30-50 more pages I threw in the towel.",1
"I read Master and Commander recently - prompted by the Movie - and  loved it.  This, second, book in the series continues the adventures of Jack Aubrey - a bluff, impetuous Naval commander, and the reserved, cerebral Dr. Maturin.This book opens with Aubrey anxiously waiting for promotion to post-Captain and courting young ladies, when he is made bankrupt overnight. Various adventures ensue, which the usual derring-do. This book marks the first time that Maturin is explicitly identified as a spy.  His work aids Aubrey in securing commands, promotion and therefore an understanding with the young lady of his dreams.  Maturin's world view and prospects are more sombre and morose.The book itself contains a huge amount of naval jargon, mainsails, topsails, etc. etc., curiously however it doesn't lose the narrative for me, despite the facts that I have no idea what the terminology means, the pace of the narrative doesn't lessen, and I am quite happy to ` go with the flow'.Overall a good read.",1
"WARNING: Review might contain a moderate spoiler.Overall, I enjoyed ""Post Captain"" as much as the other books in the Aubrey/Maturin series: absolutely not to be missed is the ""Crowning Moment of Awesome""/""Crowning Moment of Funny"" in which Jack presses the sheriff's deputies who've come to arrest him for debt! This book is also immensely valuable in deepening the characters of Jack and Stephen, and in introducing the two women who will have such a profound effect on their lives - Sophie Williams and Diana Villiers.It's Diana, though, who is the subject of - or rather, the relationship among her, Jack and Stephen which the subject of - probably the most irritating gap in the series, at least to this reviewer. As many others have noted, Jack engages in an ardent pursuit of Diana (whom Stephen is very much interested in) while at the same time being deeply interested in Sophie. This tangled romantic web leads at one point to a serious breach between Jack and Stephen - I'm talking ""pistols at dawn"" seriousness here. However, later on in the book, the rupture is magically healed, with no sign whatever of what might have occasioned the reconcilation, and the Captain and Doctor go along together on their merry way.  All quite gratifying, to be sure, but also deeply frustrating to the reader who was waiting with bated breath to find out what had happened.There. I got that off my chest. Just bearing that flaw in mind, I can heartly recommend ""Post-Captain"" to anyone interested in this classic series.",1
"One of the most entertaining piece fiction I've read in the past 12 months. During post-depression era, the protagonist, Jacob, is left penniless after his parents' sudden death. Completely aimless, he jumps the first train he sees and literally lands in a circus train, plunging him head-first into a fascinating world filled with performers of all shapes and talents, a miserly ring-master, a beautiful horse trainer and a liquor-drinking/Polish-tongued elephant named Rosie.Sara Gruen does an incredible job of incorporating history and urban legends: paralysis that afflicted thousands from drinking ""Jake"", an alcohol substitute concocted during The Prohibition; the humongous dead hippo that was preserved in formaldehyde to fool thousands of viewers (pickled elephant).I highly recommend this book; just sit back and let yourself get lost in this strange and fascinating story.",1
"Muirel Gray's Furnace grabbed my attention quickly and held it captive  through the first quarter of the book. Unfortunately,  I found my attention waning during the second and third quarters, as the story moved too slowly for my taste and introduced some sub-plots that were somewhat disjointed and/or uninteresting. Gray did  manage to recapture some of my attention and interest in the final quarter of the book but by this point I was as much interested in finishing it so I could move on to my next book as in finding out how the story ends.  Furnace could easily have been an  &quot;8&quot; or possibly a &quot;9&quot; with some necessary editing.",1
This book was a very easy read I will say that. It was very accurate with the  time frame an  all the  language used. Other than that the story wasn't very captivating. There was no twists or anything really interesting. I wonder if the movie is actually better than the book.,1
"I don't like the way it left off!  It leaves you wanting a book 6 to tie up all the loose ends!  What becomes of Daenerys and her dragons?  What happens to Sansa, Arya, Bran and Rickon?  Does Tyrion make it back to Kings Landing?  Does Cercei survive?  I mean really, there is so much left..right?!",1
"This is a rather unusual book, with all manner of everyday and bizarre sayings nicely translated into Latin for your amusement/education/use at a dinner party.  Just as with his very funny &quot;French for Cats&quot;, the real humour lies in the really odd things he has taken the time to translate - things like &quot;I believe that Elvis is still alive&quot;.It is a good fun coffee table book, and a must for any serious collector of great humour books.",1
"I've just started to read this and find it as good a read, so far as the previous 4 books.More great characters, locations and adventures.Looking forward to more about Arya, Brienne and Tyrion.",1
"If you are interested in what shaped Sir John Franklin before his abortive exploration in the Arctic, McGoogan presents a tour-de-force portrait of his second wife, Jane, an indefatigable traveler and adventurer. I read this book for insights into 19th Century Tasmania and was not disappointed. Excerpts from letters and newspapers give a clear sense of public and private reflections on this colonial period, well complimented by maps, notes, appendices, and illustrations.",1
George R. R. Martin is a master story teller and a writer of tremendous talent.  He develops a huge number of characters into many plots and story lines and manages to keep it all moving forward and inter-related.,1
"I'm somewhat dubious about the steady stream of gushing about this book from a few years ago. Suspicions of shilling aside, I think this is vintage Sheldon--enjoyable, middle-brow escapist trashy fun. Made-for-TV, of course. While it's certainly not deserving of ""best book ever!"" or whatnot, I think anyone looking for a realistic plot is also missing the point. It's sheer fantasy, with just enough humanization of the characters to make one suspend disbelief. Sheldon's protagonist seldom varies from book to book--beautiful hot woman who outsmarts/triumphs over/excels in the man's world around her -- but Tracey is one of the more likeable versions. Smart, with heart. Shrewd but not ruthless, only robs the guilty, etc. Actually had a mother she loved - a refreshing change from Sheldon's usual Electra-complex-ridden-where's-my-daddy heroine.Okay, in one instance the illogic of the plot did get to me. When the fake FBI agents leave her on the train and disappear, it's a bit preposterous that she could just head for the airport and find them. Even 20 years ago, I doubt that you could just randomly find two people at a busy airport. How could she have known what terminal or what flight gate they were at?For the most part, it's got clever fantasy capers and provides a mini-tour book description of various hotels and restaurants in  Europe.",1
This is a great book and is so much more enjoyable than the movie. The writing style is in depth and concise a great read!,1
"Fraser takes a break from the hilarious, over-the-top adventures of the Flashman series with this more sedate and gentle window into Edwardian England (although it should be noted that a very aged Flashman does make several cameo appearances from time to time to deliver straight talk and pinch the serving wenches). The title character is Mark Franklin, a former cowboy and outlaw (he rode with Butch Cassidy &amp; The Sundance Kid as part of The Hole-in-the-Wall Gang), who struck it rich mining silver and is trying to become respectable. He's moved to England in 1909, searching for his ancestral village in an attempt to find himself a place to call home. While he has various adventures, both amorous and perilous, the book is mostly an excuse for Fraser to take the reader on an extended tour of the Edwardian years which bridged the end of Victorian era sensibilities with the rise of the horrors of modern life exemplified by WWI. With his vast riches Franklin quickly makes an entree to the upper classes, and unsurprisingly, what he finds &quot;society&quot; to be mostly selfish, shallow, blind to reality, and indifferent to morality, This is in sharp contrast to other characters from middle and lower classes, who embody more solid values and character, and are competent, productive members of society. Woven into the plot are such items as the &quot;Irish problem,&quot; the suffragette movement, and the buildup to WWI. As usual, Fraser keeps things interesting with vivid characters and rapid pacing. Thankfully (and pointedly), the book ends as Britain mobilizes with appalling naivete for the war that would destroy a generation.",1
"If you've not read Sidney Sheldon, this is a great place to start ~ This is my favorite of all his work!I love the heroine, she starts off one way, living a lovely, wonderful life ~ about to marry the man of her dreams when her whole world is quite literally shattered.Every horrific thing that happens to her, changes her, tempers her but never breaks her.Sidney Sheldon was the first writer I ever read where the heroine didn't wait for the hero to come and rescue her and this is my type of girl.  I don't want one who lays on the railroad track screaming for help, give me the girl who's rolling her way to the sharp rocks, saws her ropes free and outsmarts the villain.I can't recommend this book high enough!!!Just an FYI ~ This book was written in 1985 and is dated ~ there is no way, with today's technologies, that the situations would be plausible.  So, keep that in mind when you decide to purchase and/or read ~ It's still a fabulous, fun read.",1
"Water For Elephants follows Jacob Jankowski who is either 90 or 93, he can't remember, as he reminisces about his days during the most trying time in his life.  He was about to graduate from Cornell with his degree in veterinary medicine when he gets word that both of his parents have died.  Not only that, but he finds out that because of the economy (during the great depression) his father's veterinary business was so far under that their house is taken and the business is gone.  He has nothing left but to take his final exam and somehow start a new life completely on his own.  In the middle of his exam he breaks down, runs away and hops a train out of town...  but it's not just any train, it ends up being a circus train for the Benzini Bros circus and they don't like stowaways.  This begins a roller coaster ride that will last 3 1/2 months with a crash course in taking care of large animals, understanding business, befriending a grouchy midget and learning what love truly is.Passion, hatred, murder and even a wild animal stampede add to the delight I found in this book. We see glimpses of the 93 yr old Jacob living in a nursing home feeling helpless followed by wonderful tales of his life on the circus train with Rosie, Walter and the lovely Marlena.  I found it to be extremely well written and it flowed nicely always making you want to read on and see what will happen.  Sara Gruen did a great job of switching back and forth between young and old Jacob and keeping the story just as interesting while in either time.  I was just as attached to and invested in 93 yr old Jacob as I was in the young handsome veterinarian with morals and principles from Benzini Bros Circus of 1931.I definitely recommend this book and will probably read it again once I make it through my summer TBR list.",1
"From the first book, I fell in love with the story and the characters.  I read all 4 books and avidly awaited the 5th.  Unfortunately I was disappointed in Dance with Dragons. NOTHING is resolved, NOTHING is laid to rest. And now, I'm left knowing I'll need to buy another book, if not more, just to see how this story resolves itself and what happens to the characters we've come to know and love.Seriously....if J.R.R. Tolkien can write an incredible and amazing story about the Lord of the Rings in three books (4 if you count The Hobbit)...one would think George R.R. Martin could wrap it all up in the 5th book.Come on George....finish up the story of the Game of Thrones and start another series I can sink my teeth into and love.  I know you've got more than one story in that creative and talented mind of yours.",1
"This book, so rousing and delightful, bogs down depressingly in the middle half. The Border Lands section is a terrible slog. Otherwise, spending time with Orm and his sweaty friends is the most fun I've with a book in ages.",1
I bought this book in September 2007. That means I had it in my drawer for almost five years and I just kept postponing reading it (I bought it along with many other books and it took me a while to read them all; then other books got on the way and so on).  When the movie came I refused to watch it knowing I should read the book first. And so I finally made up my mind and did it. It's a great book. I'm not a circus fan but the love story is precious. It was interesting to read about the Great Depression and how hard it was to make a living. I liked the pictures inside the book. I think they were a nice touch from the author. And of course I rented the movie and watched it after reading the book. Guess what? The book is better!,1
"What can you about Tom Clancy's `Jack Ryan' books: They are massive, ponderous volumes filled with seemingly countless sub-characters and side-plots. The every disaster imaginable has been inflicted on the United States. In previous books the US has fought a conventional World War III (Red Storm Rising), had a nuclear device set-off (The Sum of All Fears) and had the Capital destroyed (Debt Of Honor). Now it is a biological attack and like a bad Star Trek episode Clancy spends 95 percent of the book building the plot and sub-plots before wrapping them all up in last 25 pages.Is this book for you? If you are a Clancy fan you've already ordered it. If you really like `The West Wing' start with `The Hunt For Red October', it's shorter, more focused.",1
Absolutely love this series! Can't wait for the author to finish the rest and have a resolution to this awesome story. Will be sad once it finally does end tho,1
"Great book in the series. It was everything I expected and more. Love this author. His fantasy world is his own and the characters in it are flawed, just like people in the real life, which of course makes it a great read. Now, the wait is on for number six.",1
"A story based on facts about a depression era circus.  Story follows a vet and others he befriends in one of 100's of traveling circus's of the time.  A love relations develops, but the main theme is the cruelty and hard life the crew and performers must endure who are essentially endentured servants.",1
"This was a book that I truly did not think I'd like. Not a big fan of circuses, I just didn't think it would interest me. Boy, was I ever wrong! This book thrust me into its story from the very first page, and left me wanting more. The ending is wonderful - perfect and satisfying. While I am very leary of any book that contains abuse to animals, I found that I could endure the occasional abuses described somehow. I was so completely enthralled by the characters of this book, and could see the whole story in my mind's eye as I read. The author does say in an interview that the elephant, Rosie, was based on a real elephant (two, actually) she discovered when doing the research for this book. I often felt like I needed a shower while reading the book because it is so atmospheric and real that I felt like I'd been riding on the train without a good wash! At the same time, I felt I was a resident of the nursing home depicted in the book and wanted to have a good meal myself.  Excellent book, one of the best reads of my adult life. It will definitely stay with me a long time.",1
Great series - leaves you wanting more!,1
"In this present-day world, it seems impossible that there could someone who has not heard of Stephen Hawking, even if it is only from his appearances on Star Trek: The Next Generation or the Simpsons. And yet within this frail, tiny man lies one of the most potent minds mankind has ever borne forth, yet I am given to wonder if he would have achieved his current level of notoriety if he was not crippled by ALS. Or if his powerful mind would be less so were it not trapped within the body of an invalid. I cannot answer these questions, but instead I read mainstream publications and like so many others, stand in awe at the feet of a man who carries Einstein's legacy further toward a final answer. A unified field theory.It started ten of fifteen billion years ago during the Big Bang -that explosion that had blown out all of the matter in the universe. The Big Bang didn't simply occur in the void of space, it created space as well. But what Hawking is looking for, partially, is knowledge as to whether the fundamental forces of physics existed or not within the first few billionths of a second after the explosion or whether or not time existed either. Hawking, and others in his field, like Roger Penrose, are trying to find a correlation between cosmology and quantum mechanics, which is the study of the internal workings of atoms and the movement of subatomic particles. Indeed, it is a journey through space-time and one that if found will teach us a little more about the universe.From the dust of stars we came and to the stars we return. Much like ""A Brief History of Time"", we are given truly intimate glimpses into the intricacies of both the universe and Hawking himself. He is a man with a great sense of humor coupled with an almost child-like enthusiasm for new things. His bet over the origins of Cygnus X-1 with physicist Kip Thorne certainly bears this out: ""If it turns out that the binary system does not contain a black hole -breaking many a physicist's hear- Hawking will win a four-year subscription to the British humor magazine Private Eye. If it is a Black Hole, Thorne will win a one-year subscription to Penthouse."" In effect Hawking bet against himself, since he believes that one of the objects is in fact a black hole.Indeed, no other object of stellar phenomena has so captured the public's imagination and superstition than the prospect of a black hole. These once-massive stars of 10 to 15 solar masses that have collapsed down to mere fractions of their previous size and emit fields of intense gravitation. And those that get so small-to the point of a singularity, may yet reveal more information on the origins of the universe, since Hawking theorizes that what was before the Big Bang may indeed be imitated by what is within a black hole. As with so many things, others have asked why is it so important? And like Sir Edmund Hillary replied when asked why he wished to climb Mount Everest, ""Because it is there.""What is also remarkable is that ALS usually kills individuals much sooner and by all rights Hawking should have died years ago. But somehow he keeps going, (he turned 59 in January), and perhaps it is that drive to explore with his mind if not his body, that keeps him going. But I for one am very grateful that Mr. Hawking is still with us, because the world needs great explorers.",1
"At the beginning it was difficult to follow because of all the new characters he was introducing. But eventually I got into it. The detail that Martin uses to describe someone's outfit paints an excellent picture.I also enjoy his description of a meal, whether a rather simple meal or a 7-course meal. Especially since most of what we are dealing with is not something you find in a local 5-star restaurant, get my mouth starts watering.When reading a couple books at the same time, I usually can't wait to get back to Martin because his writing is head-and-shoulder above whatever else I am reading.",1
"Well who would have thought it, I actually made it to Heaven. They let me in on a technicality, I believe. It seems I passed the test for honesty and truthfulness. All right, only to myself, but that's a lot better than the pious hypocrites back on Earth who praise the Lord on Sundays and blast the Heathen every which way till Fridays.Not that all is well, mind. The chap who said you go to Hell for the company knew what he was talking about. This place is as full of bores as the Lords before Reform.Not only bores, but some of my old sparring partners have turned up, or rather, were waiting at the gates for me with heavenly knuckle dusters. Sergeant Hudsen, for one. You'll remember him. He was the brave idiot who killed the four Ghastlies, as I call 'em, back in Afghanistan. And Scud East, though he, of course, has forgiven me.Oh well, I guess I must make do as usual. At least there are no blasted Bishops.Flashman at the Charge (Flashman)",1
I couldn't put it down.  I'm not usually a fan of this particular genre ---- but I literally could not put it down.  When my Kindle ran low on power I plugged it up and kept on reading!,1
"As with other Clancy novels, Executive Orders is full of intrigue and excitement. Before reading it I was unsure I'd find it interesting thinking that it was more a political story than a military-type action story found in other Clancy novels, but I went ahead and read it and I think it's one of the best ones I've read by Clancy. It contains multiple plots concerning reestablishing the government, an attack on Jack Ryan and his daughter, a biological attack on America and a question of whether or not Ryan is really the president. All of these different happenings help to make this book very exciting and compeling. It's a book you don't want to put down. Although this book is rather long and many people have often complained of the length of this book and others by Clancy, I appreciate Clancy's attention to detail even if perhaps sometimes unnecessary. That attention to detail helps the stories to be better written and gives the reader the feeling that Clancy really knows what he's talking about. Also, I've read Debt of Honor which came before Executive Orders and I think Executive Orders is considerably better. For any true Clancy/Jack Ryan fan this is worth the read.",1
"I've been a fan of G. M. Fraser since the 1970s and I was not at all disappointed by this superb memoir of his experiences as a soldier in the British Army in Burma at the tail end of WWII. Fraser, a historian as well as a novelist, brings color and emotion to this story, making you feel as if you are right beside him in battle. His unit saw relatively little action, and much of the book is devoted to descriptions: equipment and clothing, military history, and humorous anecdotes, but all of it is told in Fraser's charming, eloquent and very funny style, that of a grandfather regaling the tots in front of a fire, brandy and cheroot in hand. Among other talents, Fraser is a master of dialect, portraying the Cumberland English of his comrades, as well as a few other accents. The book is not all humor, though: Fraser describes killing enemies and watching friends die in battle, and he pontificates at length on war, soldiering, and how views have changed during the passing decades. While you may not agree with some of his opinions (I don't), it is enjoyable to read and thought-provoking without being annoying. I came away from it feeling as though I had been there and had made a friend. Sad to say, Fraser died in 2009, and the final pages of the book have the finality of a man closing out the last chapter of his life. Altogether a fascinating book.",1
I love knowing as I read these novels that I plan to go back and read them again from the start. The author enchants me with her style of writing and I find myself interested in history for the first time in my life. I have much to learn.,1
"I agree with one of the other reviewers - why Jonathan Aycliffe's works aren't better known is beyond me.  I first bought a paperback copy of The Matrix years ago - well before the 'other' Matrix came out at the movies - and this is the one book that unnerves me again and again.  What I like about this book is that even though I know what happens to the characters, each time I re-read the book I go through the same emotions I had on the first reading (horror, fear, quiet unnerving) except these emotions are amplified.  If you like the more subtle, 'play with your mind' type horror you can't go past The Matrix.  An absolutely brilliant book.",1
"Some of the best military fiction I have ever read absolutely amazing and stunning.  Great author too, no one else except Fraser could make a bunch of hardened military history buffs care about a self confessed amoral coward.Flashy is also funny, witty and really has a way with the ladies which makes up for a lot.  A rare thing for military fiction is also the incredible attention to historical accuracy in these books.It is also with great sadness that I read of the recent death of George MacDonald Fraser but as long as his books exist a part of him will always remain.",1
"Some of Agatha Christie's fans may complain that this autobiography does not tell them the things they really want to know, such as why Christie briefly disappeared after her first husband confessed his infidelity, or how one can write successful mystery stories.But near the conclusion of this book, Christie herself says, ""I have remembered, I suppose, what I wanted to remember; many ridiculous things for no reason that makes sense."" (548)  It is better, then, to take this work not as autobiography per se but as a long memoir, touching in turn on those aspects of Christie's life that most interested her. Christie's life had its disappointments, even tragedies, but from the first sentence in which she boasts of a ""happy childhood,"" Christie revels in emphasizing those aspects of the past she enjoyed in the interest of engaging and amusing her readers as well.  Some of her anecdotes are laugh-aloud funny.There are no profound ideas here and only the most superficial touch on philosophy and religion.  (Her hobby was collecting houses.) True, Christie doesn't tell all and doesn't tell deeply, but what she does tell is expressed with that wonderful eye for detail that made her a master storyteller, the best-selling fiction writer of all time.",1
"This novel is written in the first person by the queen, who bluntly acknowledges her failings and records her regrets about what she might have done differently.One of the most well written episodes in the novel is that in which Marie Antoinette attempts to escape France incognito in a lavishly equipped, outsized vehicle known as a berlin. We share the queen's frustration and regret that she chose such a conspicuous, high-status vehicle, especially when she tells us that her brother-in-law picked a shabby carriage for his own (ultimately successful) escape. Our frustration mounts as the party of escapees makes blunder after blunder, such as missing connections and stopping to let the royal children stretch their legs. At the same time, though, even as we readers know the attempt is doomed, we find ourselves hoping, against all logic, that it succeeds after all.My only real dissatisfaction with this novel came from the limitations the first-person narration imposed. I would have liked to have read more about what was going on outside Marie Antoinette's chambers, to learn more of what was taking place in the minds of the people around her. All in all, though, this is a historical novel well worth reading.",1
"This book is a great read. Very enjoyable to learn about circus life. The author did a lot of research about the circus so it makes the story very real. I couldn't help but cringe sometimes with the story of the animals, but there is always a dark side to everything. Highly recommend it. An overall great book.",1
"I read this trilogy when it first came out.  The Fionavar world immediately became part of my personal universe, a place I revisit every couple of years just to remind myself of its incredible richness.  Don't miss it.",1
"This is my first time reading a Clive Cussler novel and I loved it!!  Yeah there is romance in there but not so much to make you gag and the action is just superb! Dirk and Al are quite the team: strong, intelligent, and humorous.There is the too much detail thing.  My English teacher always says there is no such thing as too much detail.  And well I think Mr. Cussler just proved her wrong with that.  But anyways it became such a drag with so much detail but I still love the book and the movie for that matter.  But they just dont seem to parallel; they just collide.  But that's okay because I still like them anyways.",1
"Alex Cross is a forensic psychologist as well as a Washington, D.C. police detective. He's also a black man whose wife was murdered several years ago, leaving him with two small children to rear - thankfully not alone. His grandmother, a formidable retired educator whom Alex calls Nana Mama because after his mother's early death he knew no other parent, lives with the family and takes care of the children. When two nasty murder cases involving black families come his way, Alex wants to catch the killer even more passionately than usual. But before he really gets the investigation underway, two white children are kidnapped from an exclusive private school when they were supposed to be under Secret Service protection. Thanks to the unwanted fame brought to him by a recent news article, the mayor orders Cross pulled off the murder cases and assigned to the kidnapping. Cross is his best, the public surely believes, and the mayor must be seen giving this case his best. For its victims are the young daughter of a film star, and the young son of the Secretary of the Treasury.Cross doesn't want to investigate a kidnapping for ransom whose victims need him a lot less, in his opinion, than the black families who will likely become the deranged killer's next targets. His resistance gets him nowhere with the mayor. But as he works on the kidnapping, however unwillingly, he comes to know the Secret Service supervisory agent on whose watch it happened; and before he knows it, widower Alex Cross is falling in love with a most unsuitable partner. A beautiful white woman in the same dangerous business.The cases he wants to investigate can't possibly be connected with the kidnapping that he thinks someone else can and should handle. Or can they? The more he learns, the less he feels that he really knows. Has the brilliant Alex Cross finally met his match, in a criminal even more intelligent and driven than he is?This is a scary book indeed, and not due to excessive gore. It's got some of that, yes; but the worst of its terrors are psychological, as Cross pursues a psychopath. I'm told this is the first book in a series, and after it kept me awake until the wee hours of this morning I find myself eager to get my hands on the next installment. I want more of this protagonist! And more of this author, too!--Reviewed by Nina M. Osier, author of 2005 science fiction EPPIE winner ""Regs""",1
"This book turned out to be not at all what I was expecting. Shelved in with the mystery/thrillers, and boasting a creepy title, it sounded like it would be an exciting, suspenseful story with a strong focus on plot. Instead, the book really focused on character redemption. The narrator was quite likable, and some of his interior monologue actually made me laugh out loud. And while Pyper created an eerie atmosphere, his over-use of nightmares to create that spooky tone became quite frustrating after a while. The role of ""villain"" was very loosely applied here, and none of the characters really fulfilled that part. I enjoyed Pyper's writing style, and though it did not meet my expectations, it was certainly a unique sort of novel. It started out very strongly, and unfortunately, that strength did not carry through the entire novel. It had some definite high points though, so I would not be averse to reading another one of his books, but I won't be rushing out to purchase more either.",1
"This is a timeless classic.  Over the years I've given it as a gift more times than I can count, and will continue to do so.  Addresses real life issues in a beautiful way and makes us reexamine our own attitude about how we see what happens in our lives.  So easy to read over and over.",1
"Not only does this dictionary have a more complete variety of words than many, but it also contains a number of helpful proper nouns which come in handy when reading a text which is heavy in allusions.  The little grammar and verse section also is a good resource to have around if something slips your mind. Using this, I've never even thoughts about buying a bigger dictionary since this has so much of what I need.",1
"This book is drier than the wonderful BBC series starring Ian Richardson. But because Michael Dobbs spent years as a journalist covering British politics, plot points that are simplified or glossed over in the series are explained in more detail. So I feel like I understand what went on in the TV series more, but it's not as much fun. The book went through some significant changes on the way to the teleplay adaptation.",1
Very interesting perspective. This book sheds light on how the Tudors made claim to the throne. I have always wondered.,1
"I was surprised at all the rave reviews of this book. I'm a huge fan of Donaldson, not only from his Tomas Covenant books, but from his much lighter &quot;Mordant's Need&quot; books.His first go at science fiction was a sight to behold, an ugly and disgusting world where everything makes you wretch and everyone is your enemy. All of the characters have huge flaws and proceed along paths that I can't imagine any sane person taking. I hated everyone in the book, and felt sorry for them at the same time. I couldn't read any more. If that's what Donaldson was attempting, I applaud him, but I won't read any more of these books.",1
"As always Agatha Christie is entertaining and this book is a must for her fans.  It's been said thousands of times, Agatha Christie was a master at her craft.  Read and ENJOY.",1
"This book kept me up late at night. The story unfolds at a great pace, intermingling present and past. I was so involved in Lady Matilda's and Jo's characters and their intertwined destinies , that I could literally feel their emotions, pain and fear, the book is so well written it plunges you right in the middle of it all. A great story. I would highly recommend it. This book will make you want to discuss with others who have read it - it stays with you long after you have finished it.",1
Getting real tired of your shit Dany. Stop whining and regrow the pair you had in the earlier books. R+L=J!!!,1
"An excellent mystery, Agatha Christie in great form, keeps us guessing almost all the way to the end - however, the ending is rather too improbably dramatic for my taste.",1
This book is a good read. Long chapters but puts you right in the circus with Jacob and Marlena and Rosie.,1
"Wow, what a great story. Wonderful book, audiobook was fantastic! Would recommend listening to the audiobook over reading the book.",1
"George MacDonald Fraser is one of my favorite authors. It used to be (before Amazon) that I would have to find his books in Canada or England,  if I happened to be there. Now, of course, he's quite popular in this  country. I love his Flashman series, and they have accompanied me on many a  vacation.Mr. American contains his usual historical accuracy, though  it's not intended to be as funny as the Flashman series. Harry Flashman  shows up though, but in this book he is used to decry the folly of war, in  most of its forms, certainly that of WWI.The title character is an  American who becomes an observer of the decadence of post Victorian  England, as well as one welcomed into it, as long as he is useful to those  snobs whose society he is invited to enter. Whether he is to be amusing to  King Edward, or to use his money to restore his wife's family fortunes, he  is brought into the swim, only to find that it is a shallow pool  indeed.But along the way he comes into contact with delightful and  trustworthy characters, none of whom are of the upper class, and it is  these characters who make the snobs, by comparison, seem so feckless. Pip  is as wonderful as Samson is loyal and unperturbable. It is these  characters, and Prior and Thornhill, whom we are able to compare and  contrast with Percy, the Claytons and those who surround the King. Pip,  like most people who are positive and seemingly without a care, is in fact  very ethical, supportive of her family, and without guile. The others, in  their own ways, represent bedrock values and character, quite a contrast to  the carefree, unethical, and undignified society people.I highly  recommend this book, for its sheer pleasure of reading it.",1
"This book was great! Unable to put it down, very detailed. It made me feel like I was there!!! Can't wait to see the movie.",1
"With every chapter of this book things get more entangled. I was hooked from beginning to end although there were times when it was a struggle to get through . I can't for the next one to come out even though it's going to take 20,000,000 years for it to come out.",1
A most entertaining story about the adventures of Orm the Viking! My interest was held throughout the whole book. I recommend it!,1
