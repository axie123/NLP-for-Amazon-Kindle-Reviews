"This is the fifth book in a series.  I first saw the video of Game of Thrones and was hooked so I bought the book which really cemented my interest in the Starks and the Lanisters.  I couldn't wait to read the next book which had many surprising twists that led me to the third book which I enjoyed but not as much as the preceding volumes.  I struggled with the fourth book but did finally finish it and I purchased the fifth book which was so slow and dull that I quit reading after 600 pages -- I might ultimately finish it but I'll wait and see.  I became entranced with Ned and Catelyn Stark and their Children Sansa, Robb, Bran, Arya, and Rickon.  Tyrion Lanister was easily the most interesting character I have encountered in a long time.  Cersei and Jaime Lanister were equally fascinating as was Brienne.  But Martin killed off Ned and Catelyn Stark and that was just the beginning.  By the time you get to Dances with Dragons Robb Stark is murdered, Arya has disappeared into some sort of religious order but her status is unresloved. Jon Snow has gone off fighting Zombies of all things and his story just gets duller and duller.  Bran seems to be headed into some sort of weird status as a ""changling"" or a tree -- undetermined.  Rickon Stark just vanishes from the story.  Tyrion's story just drags on and on with no resolution and his ultimate fate is not resolved.  Jaime seems on the cusp of redemption with Brienne but his story is left hanging and whether or not Brienne was killed is left open.  In short all of the characters who made the story interesting are either killed off or left hanging for what surely must be book 6.  To make matters worse books 4 and 5 could easily have been reduced to 300 pages each by simply dropping all of the tedious descriptions of clothes and food.  Plus more and more characters are introduced who lack any of the interest of the original characters.  I found myself skimming through whole pages of descriptions that did nothing for the story.  I started skipping all of Jon Snow's battle with the zombies as being simply too dumb to accept.  At that point I realized I was done and no longer cared about any of the characters.  A great start to a wonderful series but it deteriorates into a very poorly written soap opera about people I don't like and have  no interest  in.  It is a dull and tedious end to what could have been a great story.",0
"Not a page turns without a member of the British commando unit making a quip. The humor is so dense that even one of the characters remarks on it! And the military behavior of the British commando unit, specifically the behavior of the unit's leader, Major Smith, is so laughable that it boggles the mind. In one passage Major Smith (played by Richard Burton in the movie) remembers that he tied up a German radio operator in a room just above the room he has set on fire to cause a diversion. Well, even with Alpenkorps soldiers just yards away searching for the British, and the whole fate of the mission in great jeopardy, Major Smith, even to the consternation of Lieutenant Schaffer (played by Clint Eastwood in the movie), runs back up to the room where the tied up German radio operator is and unties him! It would seem that the World War II Alistair MacLean wants to impart to us was a kinder, gentler World War II where chivalry still ruled military conduct; IT DID NOT, ON EITHER SIDE OF THE CONFLICT!Another thing that annoyed me was the disrespectful way in which Lieutenant Schaffer refers to Major Smith, his superior, throughout the novel: 'boss'. However, the character of Lieutenant Schaffer can be excused for such insubordination since MacLean, unintentionally, gives us a character devoid of any intellectual rigor, to put it kindly. Particularly squeamish is Lieutenant Schaffer's imbecilic spur of the moment decision to marry and spend the rest of his life with a British agent he's just met in Germany!The screenplay for the movie, also written by Alistair MacLean, is by contrast a far superior product. MacLean excises from the movie all of the ludicrous quips and the equally ludicrous military blunders committed by the British commandos that are found in the novel.Avoid the novel at all costs! Watch the movie instead!",0
"I bought this book based on two 5 star customer reviews, and because at the time, it was 94th in books at amazon.ca. I've purchased many books on nutrition from amazon. This is the only one I sent back.Coming from a Canadian author, I was hoping to like this book, but after reading the small section entitled ""Milk and Calcium"", I lost a lot of respect for this man as a ""nutrition authority"".I think the author could have produced a better book, if he'd written in greater depth, on fewer subjects, the ones he was most knowledgeable on. Dairy foods are not one of these subjects, and his bias in their favor is painfully obvious.He portrays the anti-dairy segment of our society as being primarily animal rights and vegetarian organizations, and claims that independent researchers fall on the side of the dairy industry for milk's health benefits.Don't Drink Your Milk!: New Frightening Medical Facts About the World's Most Overrated Nutrient( While this book is dated, the number of medical doctors recommending against consuming dairy products has continued to grow.)He acknowledges that, ""Milk stands accused of contributing to heart disease, stroke, breast cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, diabetes, allergies, stomach cramps, diarrhea, autism, mucus production, and, get this, bone fractures!"" He fails to acknowledge the theory that's becoming more widely accepted within the nutritional science community for why cow's milk may not be a positive contributing factor for bone health. That the milk proteins can contribute to an acidosis of the blood, pulling calcium from the bones to maintain a stable pH level, and negatively impacting calcium balance in the body. He continues, ""But milk is also linked  with reducing heart disease, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and of course, bone fracture"".""The anti-milk arguments often begin with the observation that no other species except humans drink milk after weaning.""( Again, he neglects to mention the rest of the story. That in Nature, no other species would ever consume the ""breast milk"" of another species, regardless of stage of life.) ""That's hardly a compelling argument. No other species designs airplanes, develops antibiotics, or bakes bread either.""He tries to refute the Nurse's Health Study by suggesting that the nurses who were drinking the most milk, were doing so not because they liked it, but because they knew they had a genetic predisposition and/or other risk factors for osteoporosis, and believed consuming more cow's milk would help them. So, to his way of thinking, drinking more milk was largely a reflection of an overall greater risk for developing osteoporosis in general, and therefore milk should not be singled out and blamed for the increased incidence of hip-fracture seen in the Nurse's Health Study, as the extra milk was possibly beneficial, but just not beneficial enough to overcome the other risks in this ""self-selected subgroup"". While the lead author of this study may lend some support for that hypothesis, her coauthor, Dr. Walter Willett, does not.In this short chapter the author refers to the heavy environmental contamination of dairy as a ""trace of dioxin"". He acknowledges that dairy fat is a problem, but suggests we eat low-fat dairy, and also limit saturated fat in our diets elsewhere.He doesn't get into the tumor-promoting properties of casein, the primary type of milk proteins. Likewise, he stays right away from the whole raw milk issue, or movement, and the destruction of nutrients through pasteurization. There's no discussion on grass-fed, as opposed to grain-fed cows, or any issues relating to factory farming. Although he does give brief mention to insulin-like growth factor.Most people who know anything about nutrition, know that 2% cow's milk actually contains over 30% of calories from fat. The dairy industry likes to mislead, or deceive the public, by measuring ""water"" weight, rather than counting calories.This author pulls a similar stunt with calcium. He boasts, ""A glass of milk contains about 300 milligrams of calcium, a cup of yogurt 400. By comparison, the best vegetable source is broccoli, with about 100 milligrams per cup.""Of course he's not only wrong about broccoli being the best vegetable source of calcium, ( bok choy and kale are both significantly higher ) but he doesn't bother to mention that a cup of broccoli contains only about a third the calories of a cup of milk, and, like other cruciferous vegetables, broccoli has a far superior nutrient-profile. He does recommend broccoli in a different part of the book.There is some comic relief with the author's explanation for why large segments of the world population are lactose intolerant. Apparently, the human species evolved hand in hoof with the dairy cow. But centuries ago, the tsetse fly spread sleeping sickness throughout much of Africa and Asia, decimating cattle populations. So, not having access to cow's milk, human populations, over time, lost much of their ""natural"" ability to make lactase, the enzyme responsible for lactose digestion.While some primitive populations did thrive on diets containing some cow's milk, it's important to make the distinction that what they consumed is a far cry from what is available to us at the grocery store. Derived largely from grain-fed cows, pumped up on growth hormone to increase milk production, and antibiotics to ward off sickness inherent to the animal's living conditions, much of the already compromised nutrition in the milk is destroyed through pasteurization. And dairy fat today, contains more dioxin, and more environmental contaminates in general, than any other food North Americans are likely to consume.The author claims that while ""milk may not be a miracle food, it can contribute significantly to a healthy diet. It assuredly is not poison, as suggested by the likes of PETA"".Webster's Dictionary defines poison as, ""a substance that through it's chemical action can injure or kill"".It's debatable whether cow's milk, as it's generally produced today, is actually poison, but it most assuredly is, as the Weston A. Price Foundation acknowledges, crap!While ""milk and calcium"" is admittedly a very very small portion of this book, in my eyes, the author has seriously undermined his credibility. Do I now trust or care what he says about fluoride added to tap water? No!Who do I trust?If you want to know what the medical literature says about diet and health, read Joel Fuhrman'sEat to Live: The Revolutionary Formula for Fast and Sustained Weight Loss",0
"In case you stumble upon this review amidst all of the other droning articles, I'll try to keep mine short.This was my first Hemingway, I finished it just recently, and man is he overrated.  There are moments of greatness within the pages, and as for the simple act of creating a story, placing characters and orchestrating a chain of events, the guy wasn't bad.Unfortunately his pretentious writing style bleeds through on nearly every single page, so absurdly that it disrupts from the actual story.  I loved the characters, I was intrigued by the plot, but halfway through I realized that I was FORCING myself to continue reading because the poor old bastard kept getting so far gone on his cheesy tangents of love, and of the minor backstories of characters found only within the backstories of supporting characters (Pilar's matador's tale that consumed four or five pages) that the story suffered greatly.Hemingway fancied himself a wordsmith I suppose, and therefore managed to crowbar the word ""now"" about fifty times into a single paragraph, often repeating the word up to four times in a row, and the truly funny part is that people regard him as a genius for it.So after experiencing Hemingway I can honestly say that I won't be going back, and I can only envy his success.",0
"Jean Plaidy was a very good author although she did tend to make up her ""facts"" as she went along - which makes it very hard to read if you are at all familiar with the what's, who's, and such.  This book is exceptionally tedious.  I found it very disappointing.",0
I did not get the part where it becomes boring right after a very interesting start. The characters were kinda lame and very feeble. This is very far from what I expected in his books.,0
let me just say this book was almost a complete waste of time and if the 6th book doesn't tidy up the story line I will not be reading anymore of his books,0
"I couldn't read Tom Clancy's Red October, or any of his other books. They were just too detailed on the different ships the Navy has, bombs, etc. However, Without Remorse is more character driven and less technical. It is a fast paced, good story. I really enjoyed this book.",0
"As I write this the Space Shuttle just launched after being delayed for a month with technical glitches - this in 2009. It's still a ""hold your breath"" event whenever that marvel of space technology takes to the sky. After two tragic crashes, no one can take for granted that the shuttle will go and return safely.Why then does the author think that in the year of 2026, a mere 17 years from now, we'll be capable of putting 100 people on space craft and deliver them safely to Mars! This is the first thing that struck me about this story - totally implausible. And that's before we get into the whole idea of making machines from sand, who then in turn can make other machines, who make other machines who then make every conceivable material thing a crew of 100 and then 1000's could possibly want in outer space. Never mind the dense planetary descriptions and technical psycho-babble the author uses to cover-up these wild leaps of faith. Oh, and did I mention they figured out how to stop aging, even turn the hands of time backward! That's right; these people are still screwing each other at 100 years old. Something I don't really want to think about frankly.Finally factor in the most boring characters and virtually no information of what motivates them - well, someone else said it well. This journey is a three book trilogy but I'm getting off here. The only saving grace for me is that I downloaded this to my new Kindle2 for a cost of $0.00 so all I lost was my time.",0
"Boring is far too nice a word for this misadventure by author Hill.  The plot is so convoluted, the development so slow, the logic so absent, that the publishers should issue a recall on this, collect all remaining volumes, and burn them.  Someof the Dalziel stories are quite catching, but this one, as another reviewer has said, can put you to sleep no matter how inflicted with insomnia you are.  Skip it.",0
"Leaving out half the story lines makes no sense, and seems like a bad marketing idea.  But nice enough if you want to keep up on half of the main players.",0
"This book was a philosophical touchstone for insecure Boomers of the mid-1970s. Everybody I knew in those days had to be able to discuss it intelligently or risk being thought to have a gap in our characters as people. A folk/ talking blues singer of that era (I forget who) referred to this book in a lyric:""...a copy of Kahlil Gibran's 'The Prophet' with all the significant passages highlighted--the whole damn BOOK was highlited...""In truth, the whole phenomenon was symptomatic of the societal immaturity of my generation as young adults. It taught us all sorts of theoretical concepts of human nature that were not necessarily reflective of the real world--consideration, the dignity of each person, peace, love, repudiation of prejudice--all of this in a world that anything but reflected such beliefs in Gibran's day. And except for the hippy-dippy pseudo-enlightenment we tried to cram down the world's throat in our day, our peculiar era was no better. We just used Gibran and other such philosophers to peer-pressure one another into self-defeating meekness. If someone you knew was erudite enough to understand philosophy but didn't have the moxie to stand up to people when he should, Gibran was the ideal way to make him a bona fide doormat and make him think he liked it. I won't even try to speculate how ""relevant"" Gibran is nowadays. From the perspective of a sadder but wiser man--or at least not quite as stupid--I give you this Sting lyric from the song ""Consider Me Gone"" for consideration:""To search for perfectionIs all very wellBut to wait for HeavenIs to live here in Hell""",0
"Pages and pages of meaningless details and dozens of characters who go nowhere, like book 4. What a shame, after the promise of books 1-3.",0
"I loved Martin's first three books, but I doubt I will read another in this series. He is no Tolkien.  I don't mind a 1,000 page book if it is interesting, has a good plot, and the characters are well-developed.  However, I feel that Martin thought he was being paid by the word!  This particular book is supposed to run parallel to book four.  He admits that book four was running too long and that he split it.  Well, he should have taken one of the swords from the book to it.  It gives you the feeling that he cut all the description or stuff he didn't like in book four and threw it into book 5 as an after thought.  He keeps killing off old characters and creating new ones, as well.  This makes the book seem disjointed.I wound up skimming a great deal and forcing myself to read through to the ending.  Only a few story lines were resolved in the book.  I am really disappointed.",0
I was really disappointed by this book. The only parts that were not too bad were the chapters where Jacob was an old man. But the circus stuff was very pedestrian. No spark to the writing. Don't waste your time.,0
"This book is a horrid combination of writing that is good enough to keep you reading and bad enough that you wish you weren't.  The book is 700+ pages.  The heroine is repeatedly raped (forceably and not) or otherwise abused by men who supposedly love her.  She repeatedly makes stupid choices, leaving the reader to wonder how ""smart"" she really is.  There are too many irrelevant characters.  The ending is completely unsatisfying, given how long I spent to slog through the book.  The author is not bad in terms of description, but the only real element of ""suspense"" will be figured out by a thinking reader by page 100 or so of the book and is not nearly enough to carry a reader happily through to page 700.  Avoid this book.",0
"Right out of the gate let me say that I hated, hated, hated book 4 (AFFC), but respected the author's work enough to give it three stars, plus, the fact that I hated it because of its left turn away from characters I cared about is telling - I still care, I guess. So while I guess I hate this one less because we've turned back again, it gets 2 stars, because honestly, while I still respect GRRM's way with words I am utterly disillusioned with his ability to control them in creating context any longer.Let's just cut to the chase, GRRM didn't ""have to"" create two books out of one, what he ""had to"" do was let his editing staff cut out the trenchers of filler and get back to the meat of a very, very good story.  Alas, words aren't just wind, they're also cold, hard cash.But GRRM expecting us to buy that these two books just ""had"" to be published separately is somewhat of an insult to the intelligence of his readership.",0
"Don't get me wrong.  I loved books one, two and three.  LOVED them. After reading book four, I had a strong feeling that Martin was going off the deep end. Chapter after chapter of crap I didn't care about, hundreds of pages of back story download, useless information, useless characters, gobs of side stores and adventures only to finally culminate in disaster for EVERYONE I DID care about.Still I had hope. I thought ... this HAS to get better.So on to book five. The first quarter of the book is a trial. Again, hundreds of pages of back story blather, much of it about characters that were minor in the first books, but suddenly are the central figures in the series ... for no apparent reason.  Theon Greyjoy?  Really?  Why? Suddenly, some old knight that got retired in book one gets page after page of point of view, a new princeling gets his own storyline. Meanwhile, the characters you really want to know about are forgotten, pushed to the wayside, no longer worthy of a page or two when their stories are what made you struggle through all that back story to get to in the first place.STILL, I had hope. So I plowed through the rest of book six, only to be totally and completely furious with what he does in every single storyline. It's almost as if Martin wanted to lose the fantastic readership he had in the beginning. What was he thinking?When you start off a series with a handful of characters the readers love, then KILL EVERY SINGLE ONE, you've got to at some point say, enough is enough.  Did any of his editors try to reign him in??  Did anyone say .... you know, do we HAVE to kill off this guy? We all really like him.  Or, can't we get a little more of THIS person's story?  Her character is interesting and the story is great ... does she HAVE to go through this bloody hell you've designed for her?It would be one thing if he replaced the characters we LOVED with MORE characters we love ... but no. Most are simpering, directionless, two dimensional nuisances, that take the place of fully fleshed out personalities like Eddard Stark, Rob Stark, Brianne the Maid of Tarth... not to mention Jon Snow...Oh, we get a lot of Jon Snow in book five.  But take one guess what happens to him!I want them back.  I want them all back, because the dregs we are left with offer nothing of appeal for me.It seems in Martin's world, all the good guys die. Everything bad you can expect to happen, will. Evil rules the land. We're left with a place no decent person would want to be. If I have the ability to leave a world that seems fraught with nothing but senseless killing, rape, murder, disease, I think I will choose to leave it.Which is why I won't be scrambling to read book six if there is one.  It's time to get out of this world...before I get myself killed, like everyone else does.",0
"it's really hard to take anything about it seriously.  I've read several other Barbara Erskine books starting with Lady of Hay, and have finally come to the conclusion that either that book was a complete fluke or I wasn't sufficiently observant when I read it years ago, because I thought it was a very original and satisfying book that expertly wove the past and present together into a compelling whole and I have not been able to say the same about any of her other books I've read, though until this one, I haven't felt as if my intelligence actually was being insulted.This book is extremely formulaic and full of stereotypes, not characters.  The ghostly incidents in the book are absolutely ludicrous and anyone who takes any serious interest in ghosts and possession will wonder how Barbara Erskine could possibly have done any research in either matter.  I realize there is such a thing as suspension of disbelief, but when there are SO many books and TV shows out there on haunted locations and how ephemeral the viewing of ghosts truly is, it's a bit much to expect readers to buy, even in a book of fiction, that there is a town where the ghosts basically appear on demand.But the worst thing about this book to me was how insulting it was to the concept of Wicca.  I am not even Wiccan, but the heavy-handed inaccurate depiction of Wicca compared to ""Good guys are Christian"" mentality stunned me.But I guess Barbara Erskine knows what sells - this book is as over-the-top and overblown as it gets.",0
How could Martin's editors have let this go into print?  Was he to be paid no matter what drivel he put out.  Warning to anyone who hasn't read this yet - Go back and read the end of Feast and consider that the 'cliff hanger' end of Martin's career.  Martin put absolutely no thought into this story line (if you can even call it that).  There simply is no story.  I expected more from a person with such a loyal fan base.  It just goes to show you that some people simply don't care about their customers - so our only recourse is to give up on his future writings.  We have all been had...,0
"I rarely able to choose the worst books of an author. But if I have to choose the worst of Christie, this one will be it. The spy story did not interest me at all. I tried to finish it, since I'm a big fan of her, but it was hard not to fall asleep.",0
"Stop!  If you are a fan of the Fire and Ice series, do not read this book.  Nothing of import is going to happen and by skipping this book you still may still have the chance of keeping those warm fuzzy feelings you've kept in regards to this series.",0
"So mad at this book.  It was pretty good for the first 3/4.  Then it completely goes off the rails.  First is some annoying, distracting moralizing about interracial dating.  It's totally out of place in a psychological thriller.  Did the author need to fill pages for his book contract?  Then the farce of a trial.  Somehow the allegedly split-personality killer gets hypnotized during the trial.  Yes, hypnotized.  During the trial.  You could not make this schlock up.  Well, I guess you could.  If you were an overrated hack.  There's 8 hours of my life I will never get back.",0
"Boy, this thing is a mess.  Philip K. Dick never had much discipline in his writing; he churned out text at warp speed so he could keep himself in food and lodging, so some of his books are kind of junky, but really, now.It's not going to be easy to summarize this plot, just because it's so all over the place, but let's see how we do.  In Frolix 8, the world has fallen into a sort of two-party tyranny, alternately under the control of the New Men - mutant geniuses - and the Unusuals - telepaths, precogs and the like.  No one lacking one talent or the other has any access to power whatsoever.All this suppression has, of course, given rise to a rebellion calling itself the Under Men.  One of the rebel leaders, Thors Provoni, has been traveling in space for some years looking for extraterrestrial help.Into this circumstance comes Nick Appleton, one of PKD's plebian main characters.  He begins his adventure as a law-abiding if unsatisfied citizen.  He shortly finds himself involved with the Under Men, caught with forbidden rebel literature and on the run with a teenage girl named Charley.Pretty soon you, the reader, have to keep in mind Nick Appleton's battle with the planet's telepathic ruler for Charley's attention; the disintegration of his marriage and his flight from Charley's alcoholic boyfriend; Provoni's philosophical dialogues with the mammoth alien enveloping his ship as he heads back to Earth; and a partridge in a pear tree, presumably.  PKD could barely juggle that much material when his Ace Books editors only permitted him 180 pages.  Stretched over at least a third again that much space, it can't help but disintegrate.  And his conclusion makes it all too plain that the man simply didn't know what to do next - it's the worst kind of last-minute twitch.  He really should have set this one aside for a few months and let it settle, but he probably couldn't afford it.Indeed, the whole book seems tired.  It's got a lot of PKD's great themes, plot points and characters, but in a worn out state.Nick Appleton, for instance, is a solid PKD working class hero, like the television salesmen and electricians and grocers and such who people his earlier books.  Appleton, however, is a tire regroover.  He likes to think of this task as a form of art, but in truth it's a cheat and possibly deadly, as he himself comes to realize.PKD had also dealt before with world dictators, some cruel, some ill, some alien.  Willis Gram is maybe the worst of the bunch, a man who uses his enormous power for his own petty ends. This might even add some spice to the story, but Gram emerges as a flabby arrested adolescent who conducts pretty nearly all the planet's affairs from his bed.In his middle period, PKD loved to set several plot strands going at once and bounce around amongst them.  Most of the strands in Frolix 8 simply fizzle out - we never learn what happens to Appleton's wife and son, the gigantic alien leaves off philosophy the minute it lands on Earth and starts behaving like a mindless weapon, and all the threats disappear without another thought.PKD's gift for sympathetic characters seemed to almost desert him in this piece.  There's a lot of talk among these characters about saving the world from the purest of motives, but the actual desires on view seem uniformly petty - sexual gratification, alcohol dependence, the will to power. These people are unattractive even in a physical way, let alone in any other.He missed a couple of his most fertile themes this time round, too, especially the unsteady nature of reality and the effect of drugs on one's perception of that reality.  What little there is in Frolix 8 on those topics feels like an afterthought.  Could have been removed without any impact, and maybe should have been.And finally, he evidently couldn't even bring himself to remember his details from page to page.  Provoni has been traveling anywhere from ten to fifteen years, for instance - the number changes periodically.  There's anywhere from 10,000 to several million New Men and Unusuals on Earth - that changes, too.  And other examples abound.Now, this is PKD, and even his failures provide more food for thought than many another author's successes, but taken as a whole Our Friends from Frolix 8 is for PKD completists only.  If it wasn't for one thing I'd be tempted to dismiss it as an utter waste of time, but wait until you see what ultimately happens to the New Men and Unusuals.  Not only does it redeem the exhausted, washed-out feel of the rest of the book, it looks ahead to what PKD was about to become.PKD wrote Our Friends from Frolix 8 in 1970, at the tail end of a time when he could complete up to five or six novels per year.  No wonder he was burned out.  Clearly, he realized that something needed to change, and it sure did.  Tired and messy  as this book is, the compassion at its close leads directly to the conclusion of his next novel Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said, maybe the most touching evocation of human despair since the novel was invented.  Out of this transformation of his creative process, he produced A Scanner Darkly and the VALIS trilogy.  Now, that's the way to conclude a career.In 1970, PKD had only a few years to live, but he used them well.  If he needed to plow through Our Friends from Frolix 8 in order to do that, I say it was worth it.  Suppose we look on this novel as his way of clearing the decks and let it go at that.Benshlomo says, Every so often you have to throw the past overboard.",0
an okay read.  Plot was not very exciting nor suspenseful.  Characters were not well developed nor likeable. The TV series was 1000 times better...and I usually prefer a book.,0
"Let me say I think GRRM has a great sense of character and can do a plot twist like nobody's business.That said, does he know how to wrap up ANY storyline without a death to the main character in that storyline?  We've invested hours and pages in characters and plotlines, only to have brand new characters introduced...AGAIN... and a character we are invested in killed off because GRRM doesn't know what else to do with them.I was hoping to find Dance With Dragons have more focus and development on Jon, Arya, Bran and their wolves, Tyrion, Cersie, Jamie, and Dany and Sam.  Was I disappointed?  In the end - yes, big time.  (possible spoiler ahead)I got a lot of back & forth with Dany and Meeren and almost no development of her relationship with the dragons or who else may ride them.I got bits of Arya's growth, but not much and only toward the end of the book.Bran - a few chapters of odd situations that seemed like filler and a way to put him aside.Jon got chapters about his dealings with Wildings and Stannis, but not the Others or Ghost.Cersie - chapters toward the end of the book ending in her being marginalized and set aside.Jamie - one chapter only!Sam - nothingTyrion - Hurray!  Some interesting bits of intrigue but not what I was hoping for.New people - lots and lots and I didn't care about any of them at all.I loved books 1 & 2 and they got me hooked on this series.  Book 3 was annoying at times, but I stuck with it.  Book 4 was a dissappointment because of the new characters, but I gave it a chance & held out hope for this book.  That said, I will not recomment this book or series to anyone and I doubt I'll read anything else in the series in the future.  GRRM is a good writer, too bad he cannot end a story.  Maybe a new editor would help, but I doubt it.",0
Jon Snow's decision to feed the wildlings rather than simply burn the bodies of the ones who starve ruins what could have been a promising turnaround in the story.,0

"I enjoyed reading the first half of this book, but I found myself skimming through parts in the middle.  Not sure if I understand all the fuss.",0
"I had high hopes for ""Flashman,"" hearing the series described as having the wit of Wodehouse, lots of rousing adventure and historical accuracy. But with an early scene of Flashman slapping around his girlfriend and then playing a cruel trick on a fellow officer, my enthusiasm waned. Things just got worse with more beatings of women, lots of racist ranting and some unconvincing swashbuckling. Fraser seems to find humor in thuggery and charm in crude brutality. Harry's just not an appealing character, and the ""historical detail"" is not worth having to put up with him. And as this was written in 1969, the lavish use of the n-word seems a particularly interesting choice. (As I am also a big fan of Chuck Palahniuk, Outkast and Adam Sandler, you can't dismiss me as some kind of PC prude.) The rousing adventure is usually of the ""farmer's daughter"" type and the settings doesn't come to life. Why would I read another book about a nasty frat boy when it just really isn't any fun? Try T.E. Lawrence (""Seven Pillars of Wisdom"") or Robert Byron (""Road to Oxiana"") if you want genuinely amusing Brit characters in exotic locales.",0
"Does anyone have a clue as to where this series is going?  Martin seems to be mired in a morass of his own making.  He's going nowhere and taking an eternity to get wherever nowhere is.  The cliff-hangers are getting stale, the characters are becoming less and less engaging, and I'm at the point where I don't even care how the series ends any more.  Martin needs to do everyone a favor and wrap the whole thing up once and for all.  But from the way this series is creeping on and on and on, I have a sinking feeling the ending is going to be less of a bang than a whimper.Judy Lind",0
"i'm halfway through, and it already deserves a five star review. the 6 year wait was worth it, i just hope he doesn't take another 18 years to finish the series!!EDIT:yeah.. ^^^^^^^^^ that was wrong.  i just finished the book today.  i'm not going to paraphrase the entire book or plot lines that i enjoyed/hated.  this book is, to put it simply, poorly written.the first 3 books left me dying to read more.  the fourth book was generally uninteresting, but i plowed through it twice and upon 2nd reading realized that the 2nd half of the book was actually worth re-reading.  this book, though i've only read it once, makes me wish i never picked up the series in the first place.the writing style has gone downhill, as if GRRMs voice has become a caricature of itself, and all editing has gone out the window.  i was terribly excited to see all the characters i missed in AFFC at first, and anticipated big meet-ups and possibly an explanation of ANY mystical elements thus far.  i was disappointed yet again.  to the people who are saying, ""well it's just the 2nd half of AFFC, it's a good 'transition piece.'"" does that mean that the 2nd half of a mediocre book should be just as (if not more) mediocre?  i guess in a strange way that does stand to reason, but GRRM [was] so good at bashing expectations!  now it seems like he's a one trick pony, using tiny cliffhangers at the end of chapters to keep us interested.  characters repeating themselves incessantly. even multiple characters having the same memories of things, verbatim..it would be one thing if the next book will come out next year, but as we've heard, GRRM isn't even starting the next book for another year. so it will be at LEAST 2-3 years before the next book comes out, and quite possibly a decade or more before the series is concluded.  i needed a little more out of this book to keep me interested.  sorry GRRM, but i don't know if i can",0
"I found this book to be fairly uninteresting. It was a very quick read, but I figured out who was whom early on and then just found it to be rather dull to get through the book.",0
"MILD SPOILERS--I'm a little confused as to why this novel is classified as literary fiction, as it's lacking the strong character development and emotional complexity that most literary fiction strives for.  I'm aware I'm in the minority, but I can't honestly say I enjoyed this book.  It was very predictable, and the characters were wooden.  Marlena has zero depth--and Joseph isn't much better.  They fall in love, but it seems more like the affair happens because the author wrote it into the plot, not because these were two developed, real people whose minds and hearts shared something magical.  A few of the secondary characters have more detail, but they never go beyond superficial personality traits.The elephant is the absolute best part, and once I read that Gruen was inspired by old stories and photographs of real circus elephants and performers, I wished she'd gone ahead and written a non-fiction book so she could really delve into the struggle of the era and the horrible treatment of these animals.  She makes aspects of the circus interesting--in fact, that's why I kept reading even after I'd given up on the story having any real complexity or resonance, but the whole book is littered with anachronistic language that disturbs the realism she's aiming for.She's trying to get at some very deep issues (mental illness, extra-marital affairs, spousal abuse, the traumas of the Great Depression) but it's all very superficial.  She never quite digs deep enough to give these real complexity or power, so all of the characters have very obvious, stereotypical, predictably shallow reactions to these deep issues, and I was left feeling a bit like I was reading a kid's slightly juvenile interpretation of events.  Overall, disappointing and even a little simplistic.  The frame of Joseph in the old folks' home is the richest and most emotionally complicated part of the text--until the ending, which is utterly unrealistic and saccharine.",0
"So disappointed.  As what most readers will say, the first three books were phenomenal.  I could not put the books down.  Now though with the last 2, and especially this one, I forced myself to finish.  It really feels like GRRM has lost interest in this series and that he is only writing now for a paycheck.  This book was mostly filler, just like the previous one.  GRRM would spend pages on how someone felt, look or just the scenery.  I am also getting a sense that he has no idea what to do with his characters anymore.  They just keep dieing.When the next nook comes out (whenever that may be), I will definitely wait to see what the reviews are prior to spending the money to buy it.  The series is so not worth the money as it currently stands.",0
"Passenger to Frankfurt was published in 1970 when author Dame Agatha Christie was 80 years old. The novel is atypical for the Queen of Crime in that it deals with a rebellion by youth. There are no drawing room murders or much character development. Think of a mismash of ""Brave New World""; ""1984"" and dystopian views of society's future.Sir Stafford Nye is seated in the passenger lounge at the Frankfurt airport awaiting a flight to London. He is accosted by a young woman who begs to dress in his clothes so she will escape from persons seeking to murder her.She dresses in Nye's cloak and uses his passport. Nye drinks a drugged beer but is later revived. Back in London he meets the mysterious woman. She is Countess Renata Zerkowsi. Renata is part of a top secret team which is combasting the rise of a Neo-Nazi youth movement being led by a charismatic young leader named Young Siegfried.The Aryan looking young man is the son of Adolf Hitler who fled to Argentina where he married a blonde Englishwoman who gave birth to Franz Josef leader of the New World State. The boy has a Swastiza tattoo on his foot.The most interesting characters are not the pallid Nye but his Aunt Matilda. She voices many of the concerns about society held by author Christie. Also of interest is a fat old woman named Charlotte who is a doyen of the Neo-Nazi resurgence. As the novel ends Nye and Renata are planning their wedding.The novel contains long sections wherin Christie laments the state of modern society. The novel is often dull.This is one of the last Agatha Christie books I would recommend to a new reader of her countless works of fiction.",0
"For the most part this book follows the traditional Clancy model of an exciting beginning, a really long boring middle, and an exciting finish.  The difference with this one is that the beginning isn't that exciting and the middle is even longer than normal.  And again, this book would be so much better if it was shorter.There is a really interesting story buried inside, but there is so much extraneous material that it's hard to enjoy.  There are sub-plots that amount to nothing, extraneous details that aren't that interesting, and a pace that is excruciatingly slow.  Cutting out the unnecessary material would probably cut out about 250 pages, and that would have made this book enjoyable and better paced.  As it is, the book is a chore to finish and unsatisfying in the end.I was making an attempt to read through the Tom Clancy books I own, but this one was simply too much work.  At this point I'm no longer enjoying Clancy's writing, and I'm not sure I'll ever bother to read the rest of his books.",0
Are you kidding me? This book was a best seller? It could have been written by a middle school student. I read this book in two days flat. The characters were very shallow. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because parts of it were cute but overall it was a waste of my time.,0
"Like many readers, I was smitten with the world Martin created inA Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1), was caught up in the vivid showing of the battles and the intrigue inA Clash of Kings (HBO Tie-in Edition): A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Two, and was impressed by his ruthlessness towards his characters inA Storm of Swords (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 3).  As with many readers and fans, I cut Martin some slack inA Feast for Crows (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 4)- the storyline was just too big, apparently for a single book. A rationale I thought reasonable, and although the storyline moved at a glacial pace, I had high hopes for some resolution of loose ends from Book 4, and some forward movement in _A Dance with Dragons_.  Were that it was so.  _A Dance with Dragons_ was in many ways, an utter disappointment.That is not to say I found Book 5 a total bust.  To avoid spoilers, I'll write in broad terms.  I did like the wider sense of geo-politics Martin develops here, as the conflict in Westeros has ramifications in the Free Cities and Valyria.  It was a relief to see the storylines that had diverged in _A Feast for Crows_  again rejoin each other, and readers are given a longer perspective of the political web that ""the game of thrones"" is: princes thought long dead instead found in hiding, old alliances and old rivalries between noble houses uncovered, details of storylines from the first four books (particularly around Daenyrs) brought to light.  In a perverse way, I also liked the lack of resolution of some of the story lines: tantalizing clues left about what will happen with Daenerys, Arya, the dragons; characters in difficult situations that I am anxious to see solved: Jon on the Wall, Bran Beyond the Wall, and Jamie and Brienne in the Riverlands.  As much as I enjoyed this, it was not enough to earn more than a mediocre review.There are many more points that I take issue with than there are redeeming features.  First is the geologic pace at which the story moves.  At just under 1000 pages, I had expected more forward movement of the plot.  This did not happen.  Stannis remains in the North.  Daenerys remains in Slaver's Bay.  Tyrion, for much of the story, is at sea - and so on ad nauseum with all the characters.  Books One and Two moved much more quickly, and which I liked much more..  Perhaps juggling 23 story lines has simply become untenable for Martin to maintain.  Another issue I had concerned the changes in authenticity of several of the characters.  While I recognize characters do (and should) change across the story line, Martin has several of his characters take almost 180 degree turns from who they were in the first four books - especially Jon (""The Night's Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms"") and Tyrion.  I also expected at least some sort of ""chekcing in "" with other characters from _A Feast for Crows_ would happen once the storylines from Book 4 was reunited in Book 5 - specifically the happenings and goings on of Sansa and Samwell Tarley.  It looks like readers will have to wait for the next installment to see what these characters have been up to.  In a similar vein,  Jamie was hardly mentioned at all.The divergence of story lines between Books 4 and 5 was a challenge as well.  As a relative new comer to the series, I had the advantage of being able to read the books more or less concurrently (I pity those who had to wait over four years between books), but even then I frequently found myself going back to _A Feast for Crows_ to reacquaint myself with characters and their stories that  I had fogotten all about, it having been 500 or 600 (or, in the case of Daenyrs) almost 900 pages since last they were a part of the story.  Some sort of prologue (other than the pointless prologue involving Wargs and apprentice maesters) recaping the story thus far would have been helpful, I think.As much as I am tempted to give _A Dance with Dragons_ a one-star rating, I can't.  This is a work in progress - I remain hopeful that, once the ""Song of Fire and Ice"" is completed, my objections and complaints will be inconsequential.  While I remain frustrated that the story has moved so little over the last two books, I also remain optimistic that there will be a payoff in the book(s) to come.  Those expectations aside, for a 1000 page investment in reading, there is precious little payoff for audiences here.",0
"The book is worthy of the praise it has received and its position on the Best Seller lists.  The film is a total travesty from screenplay to cast.Why trash the Kindle edition with a terrible cover? Even if no one sees the cover on their Kindle, viewing it online is a reminder of how badly Hollywood butchered the book.",0
"It's inexcusable for this book to be as bad as it is, when the author is clearly a very able writer, and capable of coming up with some lovely twists. It showed promise; but some of the things MacLean asks the reader to accept just stretch credulity too far.  The plot has holes, the good guys are crammed full of contrived and tedious bravado, and, most infuriating of all to me, the hero continually endangers his soldiers and his mission through an utterly inexplicable refusal to kill nazis.  I really hope the movie is better (I've yet to see it).It's not without its charms.  You may be able to enjoy the way the hero cleverly improvises his way out of one predicament after another, if you can make yourself forget that many of the predicaments are directly caused by his own astonishingly stupid decisions.  You may find it possible to get your money's worth out of this book by just numbing yourself to the silliness, picturing Clint Eastwood, and accepting it as a quick-read thriller that will make - I promise - absolutely no demands on your intelligence.  But I couldn't do it.  Not recommended.",0
"This book is completely uninspired. Huge swaths of pages are almost unreadable. This is fiction at its worst, pressing every button to garner the highest thrill quota. Patterson does do a little better with his following novels `Kiss the Girls,' and 'Jack and Jill,' and this is his first novel I presume from over ten years ago, but it pales in comparison to some other better works. Try Jim Thomson, Edward Bunker, or `Silence of the Lambs' (Which Patterson sadly rips off left and right here).This book leaves a disgusting film over the reader's cerebral cortex. Its only saving grace is an interesting twisting plot line that really packs a well thought out wallop.Read the two in the series that I recommended and stay away from the rest of Patterson's toxic waste land.",0
"At the end of ""A Feast for Crows"" (AFFC) we could read :""Tyrion , Jon , Danny ..... will be along next year (I devoutly hope) in A Dance with Dragons (ADWD), which will focus on the events along the Wall and across the sea, just as the present  book focused on King's Landing.G.Martin June 2005""Further, to justify that just 680 pages of AFFC took 5 years to be written, G.Martin tells us that ADWD was ALREADY finished. He merely had to publish the available material in two books instead of one.Well as we all know, ADWD didn't come the next year nor the year after. The book ""already written"" in 2005 took full 6 years to be published. It was necessary to remind these facts because, obviously this incredibly long time span raised significantly our expectations.If we had already to wait so long, it better be a masterpiece of A Storm of Swords caliber.Let us be honest, ADWD is to the Song of Ice and Fire what the Crossroads of Twilight were to the Wheel of Time. In other words a subpar lazy piece of writing which deserves 1 star because it is not possible to give less.As an aggravating circumstance comes that this piece of .... work was laboriously extruded during a full decade (AFFC+ADWD = 11 years).The Crossroads of Twilight has been very weak but at least R.Jordan didn't need 11 years to throw it at us.Readers and the series fans have speculated that George Martin has lost inspiration or interest.I submit that he lost both.First he obviously lost interest.ADWD has 959 pages prologue and epilogue included and contains 73 chapters.Let us be generous and consider that Martin mislead us and that actually only the half of this has been written in june 2005, so 480 pages and 37 chapters.That leaves us with 36 chapters and 480 pages to write.Obviously a writer committed  to his work and as devoted as G.Martin says he is, will put some hard work in the writing.Nobody expects 8 hours a day but ... what do you think about his interest when the result is 480 pages in 6 years, 312 weeks?If one considers that Martin wrote more than 1 chapter a week for the first 3 volumes (and how GOOD those volumes were !), he'd have indeed needed about 1 year to finish ADWD as he said.The unavoidable conclusion by comparing the 37 weeks of work with the 312 weeks delay is that Martin spent about 10% of his available productive time on writing ADWD.Those glaring disparities tell a clear story : while Martin had been both inspired and interested during the first 3 volumes, he bungled AFFC and completely lost interest in ADWD.As this would be irrelevant we'll not speculate about the reasons but everybody who occasionaly read Martin's blog knows why he lost interest.A severe case of hypercephalitis (new Tolkien indeed !) has certainly played a role .Second he lost inspiration.Here we will go in some length and spoilers are unavoidable. Actually there is nothing surprising or unexpected that happens in ADWD to warrant a spoiler alert but it is a tradition that I respect.As I said, ADWD is composed of 73 chapters. They are structured as folllows:The Wall+ Stannis: 22 chapters and 30 % of ADWD===============================================Jon : 14Davos : 4Asha : 3Melissandre : 1As you see this part which makes a whopping third of ADWD is all about Jon. What is so thrilling about him that Martin needs 14 chapters?Well Jon counts sausages. Cheese too. When he doesn't count sausages he receives wildlings south of the Wall. As they are many and more (mostly weak, wounded, crippled and otherwise impaired), he wonders what they will eat. And goes to count sausages. All this interspersed with""You know nothing"" , ""Corn,corn,corn""and ""The night is dark and full of terror"". It finishes with a REALLY ridiculous wannabe cliffhanger which will make you burst out laughing.The 4 Davos chapters are among the best and especially Lord Wyman Manderly, one of the few survivors of the excellent beginnings, is truly a character that still has 3 dimensions.Asha is useless drivel and Melissandre without interest.For those interested about Stannis like I am, his arc doesn't advance a single inch but you will be fed (another) ridiculous cliffhanger so that you may wait the next 5 or 10 years.Meeren + Daenerys : 33 chapters and 45% of ADWD===============================================Tyrion : 13Daenerys : 10Barristan : 4Quentyn : 4Victarion : 2I admit that I waited for this part with much interest. Most of us remember Martin's whining how he was struggling year after year with the ""Meerenese knot"". For the struggling part as I showed above he didn't struggle much. So what about the knot part?Tyrion ""Wherever whores go"" Lannister is actually on travels. You may leave him a message, he will call back in 5 years. Or 10. Is that all? Yes it is. Nothing knotted there.Daenerys transformed in a whining sex obsessed teenager with about as much intelligence as an oyster. We all know that her only purpose in the book is to tame her dragons, get to Westeros and kick Lanisters' a...s. Not that there are many Lannisters left because Martin has already exterminated everything that counted in the family anyway.Well in those 10 chapters Daenerys didn't make any progress towards this goal.She's stranded in Meeren surrounded by all kinds of Ahrrakz pffz Zgriks who do not like her and want the fighter pits opened. She doesn't. Then she opens them anyway. Everything is linear, boring and predictable. The slave and slavers can exterminate each other for all we care but they don't even do that. Not a trace of a knot here either.As Daenerys is temporarily absent, to get our dose  of Ahrrakz pffz Zgriks we need Ser Barristan to give it. He kills some guy in a definitely non knotted way.Quentyn. This is a disaster waiting to happen. Nobody remembers this guy  and nobody cares. But that's all right because Martin kills him after the 4 chapters anyway. Pure waste of time and space. Useless to add that there is no knot even with the wildest imagination.Victarion is a real badass, one of the few that are left. I admit that I enjoyed his 2 chapters even if Martin succeeded in the very hard task consisting in avoiding any action or character development at any price . In any case Victarion is a very straightforward guy with nothing knotted about him.So definitely this part which makes about half of the book is happening in places we don't care about, indulges in endless travelling (Tyrion) and descriptions, contains no plot at all and is generally irrelevant to anything that was important for the series. It is especially this part which demonstrates how uninspired and boring Martin became - the Quentyn chapters are an embarrassment and an insult to the intelligence of all readers.If there was any ""knot"" than it was only in Martin's imagination because with the best will you won't find anything that would be more complex or more knotted than a highway through Nevada .Westeros : 10 Chapters and 15 % of ADWD========================================Theon : 7Cersei : 2Jaime : 1Theon belongs with Davos to the best. We are in the thick of the contest for the North. The Boltons and the Freys are still their old selfs. We get a glimpse on what's seething in this cauldron and there are even moments which show that Westeros could still be interesting if Martin was not lazy and uncaring.Cersei was downgraded from a strong, beautiful  and vicious woman in Storm to a wilful totally paranoid bundle of nerves in AFFC. Martin finishes her off in ADWD. She is broken and exits the scene. Oh, I almost forgot, the last Lannister who still had some strength and personality gets killed too.Jaime's chapter is just a manner of Martin to taunt us ""I served you a cliffhanger in AFFC and you thought to get the result in ADWD? Well I won't give it just to show you how little I care.  Perhaps in 6 years. RAFO ! Hehehe ! ""Trash (for lack of better word) : 8 chapters and 10% of ADWD=============================================================Bran : 3Arya : 2Griff : 2Areo : 1Bran's chapters consist of Bran watching roots grow. Literally. Unfortunately he's necessary to the plot because he will deal with The Others when the time comes. Probably in many and more years if Martin and we live so long. So we had to suffer through those bleak chapters just to avoid forgetting who he was.I can understand that some readers were so desperate that even watching roots grow was an improvement to many other chapters so that they semi-liked the Bran's part.Arya's chapters are totally and utterly irrelevant to everything and anything. She has been training for assassin for the last 11 years and still does so.Griff introduces us to another resurrection. Not that we didn't expect this one.Areo. Who ?So what can be salvaged from this literary train wreck called ADWD preceded by another train wreck in the making, AFFC ?Theon (7 chapters) , Davos (4 chapters) , Victarion (2 chapters) , Griff (1 chapter) , Daenerys (1 or 2 chapters) and Jon (1 or 2 chapters) . Maximum 17 chapters out of 73.1 star .I am very pessimistic for the continuation . Martin has clearly lost it and the story will now just follow the gravity forces with much and more copy and paste. The strong and powerful characters,  we cared for are dead and those who stay are either broken (Cersei,Daenerys,Jon) or irrelevant (Bran, Arya, Stannis). Oh perhaps Wyman Manderly will be the only shining moment left.The plot grew stale , drawn out and predictable .We'll see in 10 years if Martin can recover but I won't hold my breath and do not recommend you to do so either.",0
"The history and the frame of this novel was composed and written with clever genius.  The explanation of the British presence in Afghanistan was informative too, so I wanted to like this book.  I know it's satire, understand the protagonist is an opportunist , know it was written before feminism was as advanced as it is today (etc.) and the book draws you in and is a riveting adventure story with lots of turns and surprises--  but Flashman's superiority complex with women, though totally appropriate to advance the author's drawing of his personality--  isn't at all amusing to a woman.",0
"I try not to write reviews of books I don&#8217;t like. I have before, but not often. However, I found George R.R. Martin&#8217;s &#8220;A Dance With Dragons&#8221; so disappointing and so irritating that I had to write something down. I can understand that perhaps part of my disappointment came from the fact that the &#8220;good guys&#8221; in his novels can&#8217;t buy a break: death, misery, bad luck, and stupidity simply plague them. But I get the feeling that the author is using the &#8220;shock factor&#8221; of this to sell novels, at the expense of writing a good story. At every turn the good guys (or maybe you could call them the best of the bad guys) either screw it up for themselves; the bad guys screw it up for them; or fate just appears to have it in for them.But what really gets me about this book is the story itself. Such potential after the first three novels, but so many words are wasted here and in A Feast of Crows. Paragraph after paragraph and page after page, they don&#8217;t add to the story or to the characters. They&#8217;re just words and more words, seemingly for the sake of drawing out an eventual climax. There&#8217;s dialogue that doesn&#8217;t matter and events that don&#8217;t add anything to the story or move it along. And to be clear: In the last two novels there are very few events at all, and certainly nothing approaching a climax.I&#8217;m extremely disappointed in the apparent way the battle with Stannis and the Boltens &#8220;appears&#8221; to have played out. (I say &#8220;appears&#8221; because with this author you just don&#8217;t know) But the event that I&#8217;d guess everyone reading this novel waited for with baited breath? We read nothing of it. What happened with Stannis and Winterfell is covered by about 50 words &#8211; IN A LETTER TO JON SNOW FROM RAMSEY BOLTEN?!?!?! Are you kidding me? This is horrendous storytelling! Such a slap in the face to readers.I&#8217;m guessing this is all an attempt to drag out an ending. Maybe for the purpose of selling books, maybe for the television folks at HBO. But regardless of how the final two novels of this series play out, A Feast of Crows and A Dance With Dragons could&#8217;ve been combined into one fairly short novel. Nothing happens for heaven&#8217;s sake.I&#8217;m sorry. I like the world of Westeros. I can even deal with the good guys losing sometimes. That&#8217;s life. But Mr. Martin tries too hard. Ned loses his head. Rob and Catelyn get sliced. Sansa abused. Bran crippled and wondering homeless in the north. No one seems to know where Rickon even is. And Arya? Misery from the first and besides, I don&#8217;t get her storyline at all. Now Jon. He doesn&#8217;t even have the Stark name, but gets the shaft (literally) just the same.Okay. I&#8217;ve said enough. The story here, in my humble opinion, sucks to high heaven. I&#8217;m offended by the author&#8217;s callous unconcern for me, his reader. Or I&#8217;m mad at myself for even reading. If I hadn&#8217;t enjoyed the first three novels in the series, I would&#8217;ve quit A Feast of Crows half way through and never would&#8217;ve moved on to A Dance With Dragons. Dragons, which by the way, spend the entire novel out of mind and out of sight. Oh, and did I mention there&#8217;s another Targaryin in the picture (not Daenerys, who we&#8217;ve followed for five books, but at least one &#8211; if not two &#8211; more, whom we were lead to believe were dead!).It&#8217;s unlikely I read the final two books in this series. And I will be terminating my Sunday evening viewing of HBO&#8217;s Game of Thrones. I know where it&#8217;s going and I don&#8217;t like it. However, the lack of actual action and events in the books should make it easier for the TV series to cover everything. After all, nothing is really happening that we need to see to know where things are going!(SPOILER) Here&#8217;s how bad it is: Even the good Uncle Kevan Lannister appears to bite the dust, a victim to Mr. Martin&#8217;s need to put killing ahead of storytelling. One good thing about all of the good guys dying and probably the only reason I would even consider coming back for the last two books: soon the author will have to start killing bad guys! There&#8217;s hardly anyone else left!A Feast of Crows and A Dance With Dragons: Two of the worst books I&#8217;ve ever read, and many wasted hours of my life I&#8217;ll never get back.Goodbye Westeros. So long Song of Fire and Ice!",0

"I tried to start this book three times and each time I could not finish it.  Finally I sat down and forced myself to read it.  GRRM has famously said this book was a b****h to write.  Well it was a b****h to read too.  There was some plot movement in the book but not nearly enough for a book this size.  Most of the characters I cared about are not the same as they were in the first 3 books and the changes are inexplicable to me.  The story is weighed down by endless subplots and a parade of new characters that are growing impossible for me to keep straight.  GRRM has shown himself to rely on strange gimmicks whether it was the endless and annoying use of ""nuncle"" in Feast to opening up his bag of tricks as a 80's TV hack and relying on multiple cliff hangers in Dance that would make the producers of Dallas or Dynasty blush with embarrassment.  From where I am sitting GRRM has lost all discipline and interest in this project, so whether he publishes again is a question in my mind.  I find myself no longer caring, which is a shame.  ASOIAF was something special once.",0
"I read G.R.R.Martin's Song of Ice and Fire Series several years ago and loved them. I re-read them recently to prepare not only for the publication of A Dance With Dragons but also before I watched the HBO series starting with A Game of Thrones.  I was excited at the prospect of a new chapter in Stark and Lannister lives but I was very disappointed.  It seemed as if he had written his first draft, chopped it down to 995 pages and given it to his publishers without editing or reviewing the content. Had I not read his first four novels in the series I wouldn't have read past Chapter Five.  Yes, he warned his fans some of the characters from the earlier books would not appear in this book but their stories would be taken up in Book 6. That wasn't the issue. It was the lackluster job he did presenting the characters that he did include and their sloppy story lines.Martin has an amazing ability to build credible, fascinating characters that you love or love to hate. Tyrion, for example, is flawed physically but possesses his father's intellect and political savvy without the inherent evil and lust for power (or a sibling!). Not so in this book. The insight, wisdom and basic goodness are just not apparent and I am not looking forward to seeing him joust on a pig's back when HBO gets to the fifth series.  Meanwhile, Brandon Stark wanders north guided by guardians we still know almost nothing about and seems content to become a tree. Jon Snow, newly elected  to command the Watchers on the Wall, is taken out by those who just elected him. Stannis Baratheon is determined to take Winterfell back to rescue the Arya substitute from Roose Bolton's son but nothing happens other than a seige of sorts defeated by the weather.  Ramsay Bolton gets far more ink than he merits and there is way too much detail of his sadistic treatment of "" Reek "".  We would have picked up that he was a "" bad person"" without chapters of gory details that do nothing to move the plot along.. I would much rather know why Theon turned on the family he grew up with and betrayed them.Explicit sex and violence were part of the first four books. They helped paint a picture of an earlier civilization where life was short and often brutal and you took your pleasures where you found them, while you could. A Dance with Dragons just wallows in brutality, sadism and any chance of having sex anywhere, anyhow with anyone. It wasn't offensive or shocking in the earlier book nor was it boring. Sadly not the same could be said about this book.The worst thing was that the story didn't get anywhere, nothing was resolved and new characters with their own, previously unheard story lines  were added to confuse the issue. So the dragons escaped, so the Sand Vipers were released, so Cersei got a little of what we had hoped was coming to her, while Jaime appears to be turning to ""good side of the force"" under Brienne's influence! After 900+ pages, it didn't really matter. The only part of the book that I really liked was Arya's story and her trials and growth in The House of the Dead.I think if Martin had taken another year to take the manuscript he had and plan more carefully how to divide it into books five and six, he could only have improved his fifth offering. I can't see why the haste when the first HBO series is so successful and so many of us aching for round two... we would have still rushed out to buy Book Five. I doubt I will buy Book Six. I will probably get it out of the library and buy my own copy if it is as good as the first four in the series.",0
"""Water for Elephants"" was the last Book Club selection I read, and It was not my choice. Reading it was a bit of a chore for me because upon reading a small synposis of it, I felt like I was back in high school. But like I did in school, I learned something.  I learned about what it is like to be in a circus, to know what drives someone to join a circus, especially in a different generation.  The main protagonist, Jacob Jankowksi, however, was a likable character and I liked his spunk.  Each chapter is narrated by the Old and young Jacob.  The old version would be looking back in time, thus, the next chapter would bring us to that exact moment in time when he joined, and when he met the woman he would fall in love with.  The writing at times, really didn't give me any feeling that I could not put this book down.  There is something about Ms. Gruen's writing that I just can't put into words other than: I didn't care for it, and I don't think she's a very good writer.I am a very open minded reader and am willing to try anything.  This is one book that I feel I wasted far too much time on.  I didn't even really finish it as I was still several chapters away from the end the night before our meeting.Take a look at my reviews to see some really wonderful books and see if you agree with me.Eileen F.",0
"I was really looking forward to this book. I was at a book store one day and for some reason Red Mars just popped out, perhaps I was already judging this book by its cover. When I brought it home I was pleasantly surprised to see it on the list I have of ""must read sci-fi"", so I couldn't wait to dig in.Red Mars is a book that details the colonization and terraformation of Mars and the politics that surround that. Some characters believe we should terraform Mars and others believe we should leave the red planet alone.Initially this book had me hooked, however I was curious as to why the author chose to include such a massive spoiler in the very first chapter and then go back decades in time. I recommend that if you decide to try this book out that you skip the very first chapter and read it later. The only purpose it serves is to spoil one of the biggest events in the book. I suppose the author included it for an initial hook, but it's not worth spoiling such an event just for a hook.The problem is that after the first couple hundred pages this book really becomes a chore to read. The landscape descriptions were interesting at first but over time you just want to read ""he drove by a crater"", not 3 pages detailing the event. The politics were interesting at first but over time I just didn't care anymore, perhaps it was because there were virtually no characters that I liked all that much.Here's an example of the tedium - there is one whole section of the book that is well over 120 pages and all it really boils down to is a character driving all around Mars, thousands of kilometers at a time only to arrive at these destinations with a couple questions ""Do you know the coyote?"" and ""Do you know the saboteurs?"". When the answer is ""No."" he drives another thousand kilometers to ask another character the same questions. Of course this section being at least 120+ pages means it is chalk full of bore.It becomes quite clear that the author is only interested in is displaying how much knowledge he has of Mars. The plot elements are just contrived and boring. The characters never really develop. If the author didn't mention their aging then you wouldn't even know these characters were in their 60s-70s towards the end (sorry but reading about people in their 60s-70s having sex is just - well, not a pretty scene).There are moments in the book that are exciting and I was hooked at the very beginning. After a few hundred pages I just started losing interest and by the end of the book I started struggling with each page - I was so ready to be done with it. This is the closest I've ever come to not finishing a book. A 5 star book makes me wish it never ends, a 1 star book is garbage through and through - for those reasons I give this book 2 stars because there were interesting moments but overall I had a hard time staying awake slogging through these pages.",0
A settlement has been reached in connection this Roman Catholic priest accused of sexual abuse. At least six adults claimed father John Powell abused them in the late 60's and 70's. No criminal charges were filed against Powell but the priest has admitted to the abuse.,0
"Ugh: long sections of landscape details with no point, lots of really really minor characters tediously described. Virtually nothing in the way of advancing the plot. Tiresome descriptions of pus, blood, and wounds ad nauseum. Only there for shock value. I loved the first 3 books. 4 and 5 are just plain boring. Won't be buying anymore of this series.",0
Did not like the book.  I especially didn't like the fact that no one could stop the elephant abuse and didn't like the sex in it.  Pretty crude.  Too bad they had to add the graffic sex.  It wasn't necessary to the story!,0
"Oh, Water for Elephants... America loves you. America loves you so much that Hollywood is making a movie about you starring Reese and Rob (swoon!). So why can't I love you too?Probably because you had so much potential and didn't live up to it. I will admit, my expectations were a little high, given how much hype has surrounded this book, but I guess it was foolish of me to assume that if a lot of people are loving a book then I would too. Overall, my reaction was just... meh.I picked up Water for Elephants because:Like I said, other people are really digging this bookI was in the mood for a really good love storyThe setting - a traveling circus - is greatWater for Elephants only really lived up to number three. As I mentioned above, the book didn't really live up to the hype for me. And the love story was just okay. It wasn't particularly passionate or compelling - I would call it ""love story lite"". I would actually describe the whole book as ""lite"". It ended exactly how I expected to end. There were no twists, nothing unexpected, and it just didn't have much depth. Which is really disappointing because the setting was great. A circus, traveling through the U.S. by train, during the Great Depression, with hundreds of employees and a whole menagerie of animals, including the titular elephant, provides so much potential for an interesting story. Unfortunately, the author didn't put this great source material to the best use.Don't get me wrong - I finished the book and finished it pretty quickly. It was a fast read and there were some good characters, but I just wanted more. More detail, more passion, more depth. Water for Elephants just didn't go far enough for me.In a nutshell: Just okay. Water for Elephants would make a decent beach read, but it wasn't as good as I wanted it to be. Two and a half stars.And because I love to comment on the casting of movies I haven't seen based on books I've already read - I ain't buying Robert Pattinson as a red-headed Polska. Nice try studio execs.",0
"Sorry, folks, didn't find any O""Henry ending at the close of this book.  In fact, not quite sure what the ending is.  I kept expecting something more.  What happened to the teacher?  What was the point of the final hiding the shirt near a school playground?  What was the narrator's turn of events?  Nice description of events in a small northern Canada town, but as for plot, very disappointing.",0
"I realize that books in the middle of a series must necessarily seem rather incomplete and that they must set up the concluding books, but this wasn't worth the wait.Martin is still 'hiding' too much stuff while apparently attempting to set up his conclusion.  At this point I am expecting the biggest deus ex machina since Philip Jose Farmer crapped up the ending of ""The Fabulous Riverboat"" series.  It appears that Martin has somehow boxed himself in from whatever storyline he originally envisioned.The only thing that could save this for me at this point is a massive alien invasion that rescues the monsters of the Frozen North Beyond the Wall who turn out to be the descendants of stranded aliens from a crashed spaceship thousands of years ago.  The Red God will then be revealed as an alien enemy of the stranded aliens who followed them and is trying to kill them all, take over the world, and raise humans as cattle.Seriously, while Martin is fine writer most of the time, this is too much.  Well-written if you don't give a hoot about plot, characters, or logic.  I'm done.  I'll not buy the next one.  I may skim it at the library to see if Martin has found some sort of half-resolution.  I'm betting not.",0
"Why has this book been highly rated by national critics?The answer is because George RR Martin continues to astound us with his world building. And that is what critics love. They want a book immersed in the minute details, they want to be able to imagine themselves in the book. They want to smell the smells, eat the food, and watch the sights. And this book delivers that in droves. Add a dash of oppressiveness and this book becomes an instant classic amongst the criticatti.This is also precisely the reason I hate this book. There is too much detail, and this is not what I (as a fan) do not want to read. Is this a food guide or fantasy fiction? I would rather watch the Food Network than read about the excrutiating details of each meal. Is this a travelogue or fantasy fiction? I would rather buy Fromer's guide to Westeros than read about the boring nature of traveling from one place to the next where nothing (important) happens in between.As a result, we get hundreds of pages of filler. It delights the critics but it bores the heck out of me. I don't care where whores go nor do I care to read about urinating into rivers.Admittedly, the action picks up 75% into the book, and the last quarter of this book is actually readable. However, this means that 250 pages is actually fairly good and the remaining 700 pages could have been cut out without impacting the book.The saddest part of this is that we will need to wait another five years for ""Gorge"" RR Martin to write the next installment of the foods that he dreams about.As a huge fan of this series (hey, I have not only the board-game, but the expansion for it!), I'm sad to say that if this were book one, I would not have read book two.",0
"Okay, you get a tiny bit of movement in this one, but most of that is accomplished by killing off characters gratuitously, particularly those who have behaved honorably. And that's it.  No wonder he writes so slowly! He's great at starting things off...and very bad at keeping them going. This book rehashes a lot of previous material, to the extent of copying whole paragraphs from Book 4. Frankly, I found myself frequently bored and finally frustrated. Having R.R. for middle initials is not enough to make one an author comparable to Tolkien.",0
"I liked how it started, with the beheading of a relative.  And details of court life were interesting, at the beginning, but became tedious with the repetitiveness.  This book really could have been half or one-third the size, it drug on and on and on.  Getting to the end was a relief, I doubt I'll read another book by this author.",0
"I have read many of Lisa's books, and have enjoyed them.  But, this one comes across as so contrived --- too many things just fall into place -- and everything is wrapped up much too quickly at the end.  It seems impossible to me that there would be enough organ donors in the city of Philadelphia to sway an election.  Marta is beaten up within an inch of her life, and still jumps in the car and drives to the Jersey Shore --------- very implausible.  And, the ending seems thrown together in an attempt to sweep up all the debris.",0
"After reading this latest book, I still have no idea what has happened to Sansa, Arya, Jamie or the various wolves.  I guess I will create my own ending.......In my conclusion, Jon Snow will recover and go on to save the Starks and reunite the remaining dire wolves.",0
The characters in this book just seem fake. They have no real personalities. I have a hard time reading a book when the characters are so one dimensional. The story seems to be contrived because of this.,0
"Okay, first off, I had to think about this review long & hard before posting it.  Here goes...I feel cheated.  This book was so hyped up & I'm sure it had to do with the movie, which I refuse to see...but that's another story...I like the story.  I love the start & the end & for those that actually read the book...you know what I'm talking about.  For those that haven't read the book, I won't give it away.So what didn't I like?  SPOILER ALERT...stop here if you haven't read the book & plan to do so....I didn't like that the love story never really evolved.  It was just like Jake likes Marlena & she likes it...boom...now her husband knows they are in love.  WHAT?  When did that develop?  I needed more detail about their relationship & it just wasn't there.I did enjoy the history of the circus life & the life during the Depression.  I thought the Polish elephant was a riot.  I thought the old pictures from circus life back in this time period was a great addition to the book.But I really can't get over the story developement for Jake & Marlena.  Come on?  I can't be the only one who was expecting more on them??  Can I?Overall, the hype around this book was set too high.  I would not recommend this book to anyone.Guess I'll donate the book to the local library....",0
"Bought this in paper...sorry I did. A five year wait for this? I was reminded of one of those half-azzed Star Trek movies they did just to keep the series going. Even soap operas kill off people and end storylines. This book could have been okay if he'd had the balls to complete some threads and not just worried about the next payday. We aren't all morons out here, George.",0
"A friend recommended this to me, saying, ""Really amazing suspsense/thriller about a man whose girlfriend is killed so he goes on a vengeance spree to avenge her death and kill the drug dealers involved.""By that description, this sounded really promising.  Who doesn't love a good vengeance tale?  And killing off the scum of the earth?  Even better.  I was really shocked when I hated this book...and I don't mean ""disliked"", I really HATED this book.  Sorry Tom Clancy, I'm sure you're someone I'd love to have a beer with in real life and you've written some great novels, but this just isn't one of them.Just about every negative review mentions the overlong sequence about Clancy's character building a silencer for his gun.  Yes, that was tedious to read even for someone who loves guns.  The other group of negative reviewers are the liberal types who find vengeance stories appalling anyway.  However, what was more tedious to me was reading about some self-important idiot picking up a hooker off the street, falling in love with her, and nursing her, and then attempting vengeance for her after a romance not even remotely believable.I've known men who have this fantasy...and that fantasy is to find a weak, beautiful woman who will do whatever the hell he wants her to do and will shut up.  They're also the type that insist on marrying foreign women (I have to laugh when their foreign wife makes American friends, watches American TV, etc. and becomes exactly what they always hated anyway).  If you've ever hung out with one of these un-gentlemen, then you know EXACTLY the type I'm talking about and you know Kelly is exactly this type.  Kelly's girlfriend is completely one-dimensional.  No personality whatsoever...but probably plenty of venereal diseases if you're into that kind of thing, I guess.  Kelly seems to be one of those guys who hate women and really, really hate women with any intelligence whatsoever.  I've never read a character quite so flat as Pam, Kelly's hooker-turned-girlfriend.  She's not a gal you could take out for coffee and the best conversation of your life.The whore just ends up getting them in more trouble, of course.  I don't think it is a spoiler to say she is killed, but here is where the story falls completely flat.  In order for the whole vengeance scenerio to work out - we, the reader, actually have to CARE that the character was killed.  Pardon me for being crass enough to say that I just don't care about dead, previously drug-addicted hookers with no personalities who are taken in by some guy who talks down to them as if they are five.  When Pam, Kelly's girlfriend, finally bites the big one, there is no sadness in it.  Kelly's wife had died 6 months prior...and instead of mourning her like a gentleman, we find out he is cavorting with hookers throughout that six months and then picked up this other piece of trash by the side of the road.Clancy wrongfully assumes we're going to believe a vengeance scenerio where a man goes on a killing spree over a whore he treated like a piece of furniture, anyway.  Maybe if it was his dead WIFE rather than the hooker, the story would have had some meaning behind it, held some water.  Instead, the premise is set up and I just found myself caring less and less the deeper I got into this book, the torture scenes, etc.  If you're going to make someone seek vengeance quite the way Kelly does, you'd better make it fully, 100% believable and justified.  In this case, there was nothing. Seriously?  Clancy?  Is that the best you could do?  Why not his wife?  His daughter?  His sister?  There has to be SOME personal connection to your cause to carry a plot like this out and there is NONE!  It has to be a cause that the reader can connect with, as well.  It's got to make your blood boil just READING about it...but alas, a whore - who CHOSE her lifestyle, CHOSE to use drugs, and CHOSE to be a waste of space.  That's who you choose as our flaming cross?  Then you can't even show why she's worth it?  I just didn't find it believable, at all, and I like reading about men of noble character and strength - the type of men you won't find cavorting with hookers shamelessly.  Read something by James Alexander Thom who writes more about the true character of a hero without traversing through cess pools of society caused by people who chose to live that lifestyle.",0
"Martin admits in the acknowledgments that this book ""was three bitches and a bastard"" to write. If you can withstand boredom on an epic scale, you can see why.  Too many characters, too little action, and far, far too much musing about the past or what may or may not happen in the future.  Very little of any consequence happens in over 900 pages.  I had hoped that after the ""Crows"" fiasco the author would get back on track.  Unfortunately, GRRM went even further off the rails.",0
The movie was okay but the book was very sexual and this was assigned for my daughter to read. Not happy,0
"i totally don't understand why so many people loved this book. i earnestly tried to read it the whole way through but couldn't. the main character is completely unbelievable, and the dialogue is terrible (i find it hard to believe people spoke that way in the year this novel took place). the prose in this book had zero imagination. when i read books like this, i feel like the author is more interested in finishing than developing the work.the litany of things i hated about this book would take all day to write. i suppose if you were ever interested in read this tripe, go for it, as it seems like tons of people loved it. i hated Water for Elephants, however.",0
"I want to say, up front, that I'm a HUGE Christie fan -- I've read everything that she wrote, over 80 mysteries, plays and her Mary Westmacott pseudonym stuff. However, I was very disappointed in this, her autobiography for multiple reasons which I will elaborate upon here in detail.First, she utterly fails to discuss her famous 11-day ""disappearance"" in 1926 (to the Harrogate Spa), which is probably the most intriguing thing that ever happened in her lifetime! Here, I'll cite a website ([...]""But Norman, a former doctor, believes the novelist was in a fugue state, or, more technically, a psychogenic trance, a rare, deluded condition brought on by trauma or depression, which may also have led the writer and actor Stephen Fry to travel to Bruges in 1995 without leaving word with his friends or family.""Okay, I'm Hoyle with that (there was a Hollywood movie that implied that she was having an affair, which I did not necessarily accept as truth) -- but why leave such an important event out of an autobiography that is certain to be of huge interest to fans?My second criticism is more pointed. Over the years, Christie issued MANY racist comments in her various works. I won't repeat them here as all fans will know what I'm talking about. Now, this was COMMON for writers to do throughout the 20th Century so, on it's face, taking into account that this was ""an acceptable practice"" for the era, I don't condemn Christie for this initial act of making such comments, even though many did not benefit or lend real support to the dialogue.However, Christie died in 1976 and this autobiography was published in '77. By this time, racist commentary was being very much looked down upon (as it should have been), and Christie could have made some sort of positive overture, however minor, to say that she wished that she had not used certain words that were hurtful to people. No such apology, however minor, is found in this autobiography, that I could find, and I feel certain that by 1976, Christie had received many letters which pointed out these anachronistic racial comments, probably seeking some sort of reaction. Based upon the absence of such thoughts in her autobiography, I seriously doubt that any response was issued. I find that a sad omission.Finally, as I read this book, I got the distinct impression that her heart was not at all in writing it, that it was a drudgery of sorts. I don't blame her for not wanting to write it but, if she didn't want to do it, she should have simply not done it, rather than issue something that reflects a sort of sideways contempt for her millions of fans.Here's what I DID like about the work: I learned a great deal about little things that ended up in her mysteries (such as ""Truelove""). I learned something of her family (not enough about her trials and tribulations in marriage, though), and I went away sort of feeling sorry for Christie's father. Beyond these things, she came off as pretty drab to me -- my expectations were so much higher as she had been a world-traveler and COULD have said so much more. I found that the whole thing lacked a sense of history.So, I'll no doubt take some hits for my review and, if I'm in error about my facts, I'll come back and make corrections -- but I just think it could have been a super work and, compared to other autobiographies that I've read, I found this one dull and lacking in honesty.I have a tendency to over-rate the media which I review but I can't go along with the crowd on this one. Perhaps I'm wrong in that they say you should review what's IN a book and not what is absent. I'm not certain about that but I welcome your sincere feedback and comments.",0
"I am done.  Sad to say, this book has finished the ASOIAF journey for me.  Nothing happens except around 500 pages of filler. The storyline has grown way too unweildy and uninteresting.  Even a Feast for Crows wasn't this bad.  A thousand pages of Tyrion getting captured again and again with little of his usual quick wit to keep amusement sustained.  Throw in Dany's struggle in Mereen which has tons of descriptive detail that is really not necessary and adds nothing to the story. No action whatsoever. Even the chapters with Jon Snow didn't have the spark they did in the first three books.  I'm actually two hundred pages from finishing the book and I don't think I'm going to make it.  I had to stop and read other books out of pure boredom.  I hate that this has happened to this series.  The first three books were the best fantasy that had come out in years.  I did give this book two stars for the Bran and Theon storyline which was at least semi-interesting.I also think this series which has been drawn out supposedly into 7 books now has stopped my propensity from buying series that haven't been finished.  It is happening too often for my taste in this genre and I refuse to keep spending money on the premise of a series that will either take my lifetime to finish or never come out.  I am also sick and tired of funding the watching of Jets games, movie deals, monthly vacations, etc for an author who really can't take criticism and doesn't seem to have any respect for the fans who don't agree with his every thought. Enough!",0
"I would give all the previous books in the series at least a 4 or higher, and each one left me anticipating the next book.  But this book has completely destroyed any interest I have in finding out what happens next in the series.  This book goes absolutely NOWHERE interesting.  It is like packing to go on a road trip, but spending the entire trip going around in circles in a parking lot.  Other reviewers have commented on the excessive details; I don't mind details if they add something to the story, but too often the details just seem like filler (was GRRM getting paid by the word?). Too much time was spent on what the chracters ate, or what they wore (I'm talking about you, Dany), and not enough time on what they thought or felt. I kept waiting for something to happen, and everytime the story looked as though it were going to pick up steam (see Reek), it fizzled out like wet firecrackers. The other 4 books kept me up at night reading until the wee hours of the morning, this one put me to sleep.",0
"I wasn't more than forty pages into this latest failure of GRMM,s, when I realised how repetitive and lacking of story advancement it was. It is so full of loose ends, a professional seamstress could tie them up. Martins problem is he no longer controls the story, the story is controlling him. He appears to be writing whatever garbage pops into his head, to fill pages and hopefully find a conclusion, one where he can pick it up for the continuance, ""Winds"".I'd like to know if the timeleine of ""The Winds of Winter"", will be before Dance with Dragons, because in the main part of the book, DWD, a raven arrives from Lord Ramsey, advising that Stannis and his army have been wiped out, but in the first pages of Winds, we have Stannis back planning his attack on Winterfell. If a boring book that you can skip every second line interests you, buy it, otherwise give it a BIG miss. Everything that needed to be said in the storyline, was said in the first three books.Will I buy ""Winds"", no way, I might venture to the libary and take it out, just to see if he can put an end to this horrific saga.I awarded it two stars on the basis, one for content and story, and one for length. 1099 pages plus the epilogue a total of 1117, a mammoth effort of writing in circles.",0
"I had great hopes, but was very disappointed with this book. None of the main are likable. Most behave like idiots that would never be chosen to lead an expedition to Mars. Further, the story is, sort of, told in the perspective of the character. But as the story moved through time, all of a sudden you are getting one character's story line to the exclusion of the others. Not attempt is made to integrate the whole story resulting in a very disjointed and impossibly convoluted book. Then there is a half baked attempt to turn this into a political theory discussion, with an incredibly violent revolution about 60% through the book that, effectively destroys everything that had been built in the first part of the book. WTF? The our surviving lead characters become a wandering lost tribe. It just makes no sense.To the author's credit, his description of the Martian landscapes are wonderful. But I can't recommend this book.",0
I didn't feel any of the connection between the characters in this story.  It seemed like an escape from their present situation more than true love.,0
"Guy Gavriel Kay is one of my favorite authors and as such, I had very high hopes for this novel. Unfortunately, his Tolkien influence not only shows here, but it overwhelms the book entirely.The plot is relatively straight-forward: five young people are led through a portal into another world by a mysterious mage and his sidekick. They're told they're only there for a celebration, a few days at the most, and then they can go home. But things go wrong from the very beginning. One of them doesn't make it through with the other four, and the plot just gets jumbled from there.It sounds like standard fantasy fodder - and it should be. Unfortunately, the language is almost archaic, and the dialogue stilted. Sometimes entire pages are devoted to scenery. It may have worked well when Tolkien wrote, but in today's society, I expect a fast-paced story, full of intrigue and adventure.At times, Kay offers glimpses of his talent by creating a character so wonderful (Sharra), and a culture so rich (the Dalrei), it takes my breath away. Unfortunately, those glimpses were few and far between. The main characters are bland and uninteresting, with the possible exception of Kim Ford, and they're all much too quick to accept this strange new world they've been thrown in (if a mage came up to you and plunged you through a portal, wouldn't you be a little more resistant to that kind of change?).If you're a Tolkien fan, chances are good you'll enjoy THE SUMMER TREE. For the rest of us, this book is best left on the shelves.",0

Plagued with guilt, Robert finds himself at first drawn to the new stranger in town, Abram Harsich, who claims he can help the town's dry spell by building a ""rainmill."" However, as the rest of the townspeople fall under Abram's spell, Robert and his Uncle Alden seem to be the only ones who think that Abram isn't who he says he is. More children start to disappear and eventually Robert starts to piece together the mystery. The premise of the book was interesting, but all the supernatural elements were kind of strange. And the ending was just unfulfilling.",0
"I actually got an autographed copy of A Dance With Dragons. GRRM came to the Tattered Cover in Denver for a book signing. I couldn't actually make it to the signing but was able to request an autographed copy. The next time I was in Denver, I picked it up and held it lovingly, afraid to mar the beautiful silver cover. As soon as I got back home, I started reading, expecting to devour the thing in one sitting (okay...may be 2!) much like I did the last Harry Potter book. I had my glass of water and plenty of snacks to sustain me during the hard-core reading expedition. I opened the book, expecting to be blown away by Martin's genius, gasping at the twists and turns, reveling in people getting their comeuppance, you know, all the things we have grown to love from Song of Ice and Fire.:(It actually took me MONTHS to get through Dance With Dragons, something that has never happened to me with any of the other books of the series even considering that I've read through the first four about seven times EACH! I never skip entire pages, nor leave the book sitting forgotten on the side of the couch collecting dust! NEVER!The only thing that kept me going was the hope that SOMETHING would happen, something important or exciting, or dramatic. Talk about being left wanting. As I read this, I got the feeling that Martin had lost complete control of his story and that he was simply filling pages with unnecessary descriptions and such to try to hide the fact that the essential parts of Dance With Dragons could be boiled down to probably something more along the lines of a novella.I'm sure I'll read the next book of the series but I won't be on the edge of my seat. I may even wait and check it out from the library, something I NEVER do with favorite books. I love buying them and having them on my shelf to read over and over again.",0
"I'll make this as short as possible...........like I wish the book would have been.  This read was easily twice as long as it needed to be.  I got halfway through, and quit.  It was so boring.  I wanted, (as always), a good story, not a tedious dialog that goes on and on about every little detail involved in colonizing a planet.  I can't believe this author is receiving accolades for this work.  He can, in no way, be compared to any of the greats in the sci-fi field.",0
"I've read worse stories than The Fionavar Tapestry. And, to be fair, its first book ""The Summer Tree"" isn't utterly bad. There actually are moments when the story holds your interest. The problem is, there aren't many of them, and for long stretches this book, like its sequel ""The Wandering Fire,"" suffer from long passages that alternate between floridly contrived and floridly maudlin.Guy Gavriel Kay even panders to the purient interest of juveniles with a character (Kevin) who has a strangely mystical reaction to sex. ""The Summer Tree"" has a lot of exaggerated emotionalism, college-age young adults who act melodramatically as if they were fourteen-year-olds. And it has more than its share of pseudo-intellectualizing -- ""deep"" thoughts spun out of thin air and presented as if they were profound, which they are not. Maybe Kay was targeting a 14-year-old audience with this book.Kay pilfers from the Jesus-on-the-Cross story, using another of his characters (Paul) as a sacrifice tied to a tree (for three days, of course).Be warned readers: this is no ""Ring of the Nibelung"" here. Despite what some have said about the book, it is nowhere near the same league with The Hobbit, and although you can tell that Kay is trying hard, his descriptive powers aren't on a level with Tolkien's. The Fionavar Tapestry is a story, but it is barely a story.  Calling it literature would be going too far, and let's not mention art.Despite its serious flaws (from an adult point of view), the story is readable, and, some of the time, even enjoyable.  That being said, there's just no way the story is good enough to deserve the glowing endorsements given it by such luminous writers as Andre Norton, Charles de Lint, and Marion Zimmer Bradley, all of whom, if they are still alive, should be ashamed of themselves for giving The Fionavar Tapestry excessively high praise.",0
"I've edited my review to 1 star. This is an improvement over Feast of Crows. I've also seen it compared to Jordan's Crossroads of Twilight. I don't believe it's anywhere near as bad as that. That being said it's not good.Good things:One. Pacing. Feast suffered from pacing issues. I think this was caused by the splitting of the novel. Since everything that happened focused for the most part around King's Landing it didn't have the feel that previous novels had. Martin is a genius at leaving you on the edge of your seat. You're reading about Tyrion and the end of the chapter gets there and cliffhanger, and you're in a Jon chapter and although you love Jon you want to know what happened to Tyrion. Then he pulls you into Jon. Then Jon cliffhangers and it's an Arya chapter. Feast was missing that but Dance has it back.Two. Everybody is back. There aren't many chapters but there are Jaime and Cersei chapters. There's no getting to the end of the book and not having at least checked in on your favorites.Three. Style. Martin is still a good writer, no question. He has been and remains a master of the written word. Period.Indifferent thing:It ends with cliffhangers and no plots are tied off. Well it's part of a series. Plot was moved forward in this book make no mistake. Nothing was wrapped up but I won't complain about that for another two books. It is what it is.Bad things:One. Introduction of a major new character. One that was not foreshadowed, set up, or honestly needed. New characters are fine. Not pivotal ones. We should have a full cast at this point. Because one of two things will happen. Martin will kill him so what was the point. Two he becomes a major part of end story resolution so why didn't we have him sooner. It's sloppy story telling.Two. Introduction of pointless minor characters. We get introduced to some new points of view. Some were characters we have seen before just never followed from a POV. One in particular was brand new. One was killed and I didn't care. It was a throw away character. Martin never made me truly care for him so there wasn't the shock I had with Eddard's execution or the Red Wedding. Since Martin doesn't have a problem killing characters I wasn't even shocked that he died. Just mildly surprised because it was sloppily done and not what I would expect from Martin.Three. Daenerys and Tyrion. Two of my favorite characters who were always guaranteed to entertain sucked. Tyrion wasn't Tyrion. Yeah he's dealing with some stuff but when hasn't he. It wasn't the same character from the first three books. Daenerys... The one character who had a clarity of purpose and action at all times didn't throughout the whole book. ""you must go back to go forward."" I read that and cringed. Eleven years man. The Daenerys storyline doesn't need moved back. Nothing needs moved back.Four. Too familiar plot tricks. Another Stark doesn't listen to his wolf. Tyrion's wisecracks get him hit again... and again... and again...Five. Stupid tricks. Not using the characters name in the chapter title but a description. For instance a Selmy chapter marked as Queen's Hand. He does it alot and it gets annoying. You'll see.So eleven years, countless broken promises, missed deadlines, and half a novel for this. It's not as bad as Crossroads of Twilight but Jordan didn't take eleven years to write it. Plus I've edited my review to one because the number of lackluster 5 star reviews that use similar wording and seem fishy.....",0
"I got this book on spec the basis of the reviews and had high hopes, but ultimately ended up feeling that I'd been robbed of my time.  The problem was that about a third of the way through the book it completely changes complexion.  This isn't necessarily a problem.  After all, the movie _From Dusk Till Dawn_ changes completely half way through and that's wonderful.  The problem is that this changes from an interesting and fairly witty-seeming novel into a sort of self-indulgent stream of consciousness book in which the author seems to be exorcising his own demons.  He's welcome to do that, of course, and I plodded my way to the end of the novel, but when I got there I simply felt like I'd wasted my time hoping for the book to get back on track.  It never did.",0
"You wouldn't think an action novel about Yugoslavia's brutal World War II occupation could sound like a drawing room comedy, but that's exactly what this is.Nazis and Italians occupy while the Communist Partisans, the Serb royalist Chetniks and the Croatian fascist Ustashe fight among each other, jockeying for postwar position as they try to wipe each other out. The Allies wonder which resistance horse to back. Everyone's loyalties are uncertain.Despite all this potential for action, three enigmatic Serbs escorting a mysterious crew into Yugoslavia on a nebulous mission do little but talk and talk and talk. They fence around their trust of one another as they make their interminable way into the frozen mountains.The Yugoslavs come off way too tweedy for folks who should be smashing glasses into a fireplace or reciting fatalistic Slav poetry. Maclean pays endless attention to their meals and sleeping arrangements and it's all so civilized. Doesn't he know there's a war on?He tries to build tension over the two ladies' regarding mission chief Peter Petersen as Not A Nice Man, with the readers presumably wondering same. It's all rather ludicrous. Petersen's subtle inferences about the others come off sounding too much like Agatha Christie for a  World War II commando leader.Maclean pays lip service to the war's actual brutality. In his genteel war, people are tied up and gagged. Clever threats break hardened operatives in minutes without torture. Action consists mostly of, uh, fisticuffs, and hardly anyone gets hurt. Would that World War II had actually been like this, but verisimilitude, it ain't.Maclean doesn't plot it badly, ultimately addressing the complexity of this multi-sided war. He doesn't, however, introduce it soon enough, not until the last few chapters and even as it's being resolved. Before that, the book seems like a literary journey to nowhere.",0
"This book series began strongly, and I was definitely hooked. I burned through the first three in probably less than 2 weeks. I love the genre, and the characters really grew on me. I wanted to know where they (and the realm) would end up.What I began noticing, however, was that George Martin's writing tends towards being a whole lot of words about nothing. No furtherance of major plot points. No grand character arcs, as those who you hold onto tightest end up being killed off for nothing. It gets to a point where you don't care about any of them anymore, because who knows a)what the overall PLOT of the book is, and b)who will even be around 5 chapters later.Gag me if I have to read 20 zillion more pages about extraneous scene descriptions. I ended up skipping pages at a time because they consisted entirely of descriptive fluff. What else made my eyes roll? All the ""turning his head and spat""s and ""bit his/her tongue so hard he/she tasted blood""s. Talk about repetitive literary tricks. It's the complete opposite of the word 'creative'. Martin's writing is cliche and tired.I feel as though I wasted my time and money with A Dance With Dragons. Absolutely nothing gets resolved; as it was in A Feast for Crows, only more questions are raised. I was a fan, but now I'm definitely a hater. Heed my review and save your money. That day/week/whatever of your life you spend reading this garbage, you will never be able to get back.",0
"This book opens with an intriguing situation, one in which the central character goes out on a limb and takes up a preposterous proposal from a total stranger. Instead of drawing in with a question and then gradually exposing a clever answer, the book just keeps piling up question after question after question. After awhile, the questions are not of the charitable sort. It is not just that the story is preposterous. It is that I finished with no idea what on earth THAT was all about. I'm not even sure what she was trying to say. There wasn't a character in it for whom I felt any affection, either, although a lot of them would be exceedingly hard to live with. I got very tired of the old aunt who was supposedly a bit shallow and intellectually slow and who was yet so extremely insightful at the same time. I wish that in the end it that someone had ""discovered"" that the old bat was pulling everyone's leg the whole time, but that never happened. Likewise, I had hoped that the author was going to spring it off on us at the last minute, letting us know what all those odd leads were about, that she was surely not as dotty as she seemed to be, but that never happened, either.It's a book that few of us have ever heard of. Let's just say: There is Reason for That.",0
"None of the things you want to read about are in this book.There will be travel, food description, senseless backstory and endless lineage details for characters you care nothing about and have no real narrative relevance. This book is stalling. A huge, huge collection of words all used for stalling.",0
"This Book on CD's is terribly disappointing. The CD's don't play well in my car CD player - the player either skips ahead to future tracks or skips back to previous tracks or even occassionally to another CD. In addition, the CD's are packaged so poorly that the plastic binders that hold the folders for the discs come apart readily when you try to turn to unplayed CD's or when you try to put back CD's and have now ripped out of the base on the container. The product seems like a counterfeit product produced in a back alley in Bejing or Hanoi with poor, cheap materials. Extremely disappointing!",0
"Summary:'Executive Orders' opens with Jack Ryan, the hero of numerous Clancy novels, having suddenly found himself President of the United States as the result of a terrorist attack that killed most of Congress and the President that appointed Ryan as his vice-president.He is immediately launched into several crises as a terrorist organization, sponsored by the Iranian government, brings the e-bola virus to the U.S., introducing an outbreak.  At the same time, the Iranian government, who is in cahoots with India, China, and Japan, is also taking over Iraq after having assassinated the leader.  The world is on the cusp of major problems and the leader of the most powerful nation, arriving there without having been elected, has to answer the call.  But, what's more, the former vice-president, who resigned because of a sex scandal, now claims that he should technically be the vice-president.Jack Ryan holds up under the pressure, but in order to bring the U.S. under control he has to enact martial law, closing down numerous major cities to prevent the spread of e-bola.  He also sends John Clark and some other members of Rainbow Six into Iran to assassinate the person running the show.  When everything comes to a close, e-bola is contained, the quasi-hostile takeover of Iraq is stopped, and everything returns to normal.My Comments:The book wasn't too bad, but I really didn't see why the takeover of Iraq by Iran was such a big deal.  Sure, international politics are sensitive and tricky, but considering the stability of the Iranian government, as opposed to the Iraqi government, I can't see how it's so bad that the government fell (maybe I'm naive, I don't claim expertise on international politics).There is also a lack of focus on Jack Ryan, as most of these later books have done.  Ryan disappears from the foreground into the mix of characters and doesn't really appear to be the primary focus of the novel.  The novel also jumps around from character to character, introducing one for just a scene or a chapter, then never really returning to them.Most of these problems may be addressed in the actual novel, which is quite lengthy.  But the abridged, CD version, which is the one I listened to, just doesn't give this story the depth that it really needs.  As is the case with most of these later novels (which I happened to listen to one right after another, but in the reverse order), the CD versions were just not as well-developed as a good novel should be.  You'll have to look for a different review on the actual novel, but I definitely wouldn't recommend the CD version - it just doesn't give a very good version of the story.",0
"I do not want paperback books cluttering my bookshelves.  If you know of somebody that does, by all means have at it.

"I am the biggest fan of ASOIAF that you will find. The reason I'm such a big fan however is because of the amazing quality of the first three novels.  I consider A Storm of Swords to be the greatest book I've ever read. A Feast Crows did not live up to the hype and ended up being a massive disappointment. With that said, I still had hope that GRRM could right the ship. Unfortunately, A Dance with Dragons is the worst book he has written yet. It is a book of pointless filler where almost nothing important happens.  Too many chapters are simply unnecessary chapters where the character starts at one point and the chapter ends with him/her still at the same point. There is little development whatsoever with ANY of the characters. There are a few good moments and surprises but not nearly enough to live up to Martin's books.I waited 6 years for this novel and got a 1000 page book in which everything important that took place could have been completely summarized in less than 5 pages. Yes I'm serious, that's how little took place in this book.  Gone are the huge surprises, the big battles and the sense of awe that you used to get while reading these books. When I read the first three books there were many moments where I just had a blank look on my face and thought ""Wow"". These looks and feelings of awe have been replaced by feelings of boredom and yawns.  ASOIAF looked like it was destined to become the greatest Fantasy series of all time but that has all gone out the window. Martin can still regain it however if he can deliver in the next book unlike with the past two.Martin is still the best fiction writer alive today but if it takes multiple years to release the next book, I'm going to give up on him. It's criminally expensive to buy a hardcover book these days.",0
"The wisdom offered to politicians and sociologists, and to us all, in this long-winded account of colonization is stultifyingly flat and commonplace. Every subject in this book is dealt with much more entertainingly and better written in a myriad of other books, including sci-fi.Maybe it is our recently painfully increased acquaintance with Arab culture that makes this aspect of Red Mars so contrite and simplistic in retrospect, but all the other themes are also over-explored in a dull and patronizing fashion that cannot appeal to but the hardiest of Mars lovers. For all its many characters, described in the blurb as 'varied and engaging' there is but one type of human in the whole book, a sort of idealized American character taken from its own history, combined with socialist, communist, anarchist stereotypes with have nothing in common at all with real people.Finally, the science in the book (it is science fiction after all) is often wrong, basic, badly described and boring. There is nothing to this aspect that has even remotely anything to do with actual colonization technologies. At best, it is unimaginative and dull.The book is a political soap opera of the most basic kind, in the bad disguise of a hard-core SF book.",0
"Wow- where to start?  Well , at least I did start to read this book.The problem was it kept putting me to sleep.I did enjoy Martin's first three books but its been a fast train wreck getting through book 4 and now 5.The author is suffering from attention span deficit. And rambles on and on about the stupidest crap. Considering his deterioration and age this series will never be finished/rectified. I won't be indulging in his works any longer.",0
"I almost never made it through this book. There were several times where I almost gave up on it. It moves very slow and while, there are some interesting things happening, not much of anything develops until the last two chapters. Even then, however, it doesn't deliver.It was pretty disappointing because I LOVED Robin Hobb's Assassin series. They are some of my favorite Fantasy books. So, it was quite a let down when I read this book. It's still written quite well and the characters are deep and unique, but the story just doesn't go anywhere.At this point I don't plan on reading the other books in this series and hoping that the Tawny Man series will resume what I liked about Robin's stories in the Assassin series.",0
"I just finished reading this book tonight, and all I can say is that I do not understand what all the hype was about over the book/movie. I could not get into this book at all, and could not wait to finish it. If I wasn't the type of person that had to finish all the books I started, I would not have even bothered with this.",0
"If OK magazine and Penthouse had been writing in the 1500's this is what they would have come up with.First, it is a badly written book.  It is essentially bad Tudor porn.  No characters are well written, and they are all insufferable.  Honestly they couldn't behead Anne fast enough for me.  Even Mary, who should have been the heroine/likeable one was a winy, annoying character.Second, if you're going to make it up just call it fiction and don't try to pass it off as history.  Do some basic research.  If I can refute the basic ""facts"" of your book in 5 minutes with Google, it's not history in any sense of the word.This book does not deserve to be a best seller, she does not deserve to be identified as an historical fiction writer.  I look at author recommendations on books, and if she recommends it I put it down and move on.",0

"It's difficult to know quite where to begin here, in the face of such overwhelming praise from so many satisfied readers. It's not that it's badly written, just that it fails to illuminate Master Georgie's life. That after all should be its purpose, particularly where, as here, that person existed and at least one of the events described took place. The author is content to conjure up others to act as prisms, which would be a useful literary device if they illuminated the central figure, but instead we see him through a glass darkly. I may be in a minority of one, but it failed to live up to my expectations.",0

"I'm giving this one star because after waiting years for the story to pick up again.  This book was more disappointing than the last.  It didn't go anywhere.  In the end we're basically where were with these dragons before the book.  It was more plots more characters, boring, slow, and hard to finish.Hard to finish is the least horrible thing I can say.  I bought this book on pre order years ago.  So I got it as soon as it came out.  I just finished it yesterday.  I've read at least a dozen books since starting this book.  I finally resolved to finish it, and with that decided that this series is done for me.",0

"This novel fails to impart &quot;that sense of wonder&quot; that I look for in a science fiction novel.  Additionally, the writing is poor.  The author always manages to tell in three pages what three sentences might do as well.  The book is tedious.  The characters are not lifelike.  They do not behave like real people.  To be honest, I found the book to be a bore.  To ensure that I was being fair, I read this novel twice just to make certain that I wasn't missing something.  No change.This novel, the first of an overlong &quot;Mars Trilogy&quot; deals with the initial colonization of Mars by an international group.  Unfortunately, the characters simply do not ring true.  There is little if any plot.In addition to being poorly-written with bloated prose, &quot;Red Mars&quot; also features a massive dose of Political Correctness.  All forceful, dominant characters are women.  Men do as they are told.  Must have been something in the Martion air?  I am all for equality, but people just don't act like the characters in this book.  You can have equality without the characters seeming unreal.I honestly don't know what the fuss was about as regards this novel.  I thought it was barely good enough to finish.As I have said elsewhere, someone still needs to write a **good** and realistic novel about man's colonization of Mars.  This book is a clean miss.",0
"I perhaps shouldn't rate this book, since I stopped reading about 100 pages in.  I was bored!  I may revisit it sometime, but I think the core four books were far superior.",0
"Maybe the fault is with the translator, or maybe it is because the author is really a mathematician, but i found this book leaden and uninspiring. The prose are workmanlike to say the least. The dialogue is stilted and would sound at home in mouths of Dostoyevsky's or Turgenev's creatures.Aside from the hero, the characters --and their voices-- are undifferentiated. The women are two dimensional like figures constructed from formulas of femininity rather than real women drawn from life.The same is true of Solzhenitsyn's play of ideas. One theory trotted out after another. The characters who orate them as simply mouthpieces for the author's erudition. As didactic as a textbook. All that's missing is footnotes. Of course it was not possible for the publisher to refine and polish the text in collaboration with the author as all the great novels of the 20th C were, so we really can't expect it to live on the page as do the great novels of the 20th C. Still, I can't help but think Solzhenitsyn's Nobel was for his politics than his prose. Is he really the equal of his contemporary honorees Kawabata, Beckett, Boll or Neruda?The great power of The First Circle is its insight into Stalin's terror. But there are many other books on this theme, many of them much better. Koestler'sDarkness at Noonsprings first to mind. Nadezhda Mandelstam'sHope Against Hope: A Memoiris the undisputed masterpiece of the genre--and the has the benefit of being all true. Every page of that wrenching memoir is as soul searing as... as... as a poem byAkhmatova, another victim and survivor of the terror. There are even academic books written with more style and feeling than The First Circle.Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsarfor instance. And the works of Bruce Lincoln (Sunlight at Midnight: St. Petersburg and the Rise of Modern Russia) who was a superb writer as well as historian.I know that Russian is near impossible to translate, yet there are so many works of grace and power available to us in English. With so many great and truly moving books about the horrors of the Soviet Revolution, Stalin's reign and life in the camps and asylums, I cannot recommend this lumpen tome.",0

"While not quite plumbing the depths of the awful 'Goodbye California' or the boring 'Santorini', it's fair to say that 'Partisans' is one of Maclean's weakest books, and yet another example of his late-career decline. Despite returning to WW2, where some of his classic works were set, Maclean just cannot capture the magic this time around. Unlike his taut, fast-paced early thrillers, this a very loose, lightweight book that goes nowhere. It's the sort of book that's instantly forgettable; it's easy enough to read, but leaves no impression whatsoever once you've finished it. Years on, I still vividly remember the heart-pounding climaxes to 'The Satan Bug', or 'Fear Is The Key', or 'Puppet On A Chain'. But almost nothing sticks in my mind from 'Partisans', apart from an interesting torture scene involving a lethal injection, and the fact that everybody changes sides at least twice.All the usual late-career Maclean flaws are here. The impossibly brave and capable hero Peter Petersen, the ""heroines"" who are actually utterly clueless damsels in distress, the clumsily handled ""no-one is really who they seem"" plot twists. Despite being set in wartime Yugoslavia, the book is very talky and slow moving, with almost no action at all. In fact, very little of interest happens at all throughout the book, it's mostly the characters trading one-liners and complaining about being left in the dark by Petersen. There's certainly no sense of the bigger picture of the fate of Yugoslavia and the progress of the war itself.'Partisans' is not a ""bad"" book in the way 'Goodbye California' was, and it's readable enough. But it's nowhere near what Maclean was capable of, and will be a huge disappointment to fans of his early work. Newcomers should stick to his 50's and 60's stuff, and leave this one alone.",0
"I waited a long time for this book, but it's the biggest disappointment I've had since the last installment of this aimless, plodding, series.  From the opening pages spent in the POV of a character we've never seen before and don't see again, through long dull chapter after chapter of only the briefest vignettes that do nothing to advance the story, to the bitter flat ending, I simply could not believe that it could possibly be this bad.  I kept waiting for the old George R R Martin to rear his head and tell an actual story.  But no.  Apparently, the old Goerge R R Martin is no more.I'll bet the only people more upset than the readers who've invested in this monumental waste are the execs at HBO who've agreed to another season of the show only to discover that Martin has failed to deliver anything that would sustain the project.Hopefully, the people at Random House have Brandon Sanderson waiting in the wings and will bring him in to rescue this mess without George having to die for the honor.",0
"I don't get what all the fuss was about Hemmingway being such a great author.  This story sucked, especially the ending.  It just ends!  And what's with ""rope-soled shoes""?  He must use this phrase twenty times in the first couple chapters when describing someone.  Then there's this schmuck, the main character, Robert Jordan, who has a screw loose.  He keeps having a two way conversation with himself.  I know I sometimes say something to myself like: ""Boy Jeff that was a pretty stupid thing to do!"", but I don't answer myself back!  About the only positive thing I can say about this book is that some of the stuff in it about suicide sheds some light on why Hemmingway blew his brains out later in life. Boy, to think that this is touted as probably Hemmingway's best work!  If that's the case then one Hemmingway book is enough for me.  Now you take Dostoyevsky, there was a writer!",0

"I really enjoyed the beginning of the series, but feel now he's got so many characters that he isn't moving the story forward and a lot of it just dragged for me.  I have to say with as long as he takes to write the series, I don't know if when the 6th book in the series comes out whether I'll pick it up again or not.  It just seems like he gets you interested in a character only to get rid of them in some horrible way and then pick up the story with characters you didn't even like or was interesting enough at the start to continue the story.",0
"As a devoted historical fiction reader, I thought this book would interest me. It did not. Water for Elephants reads like a children's novel, save for excessive and serious profanity, graphic and frequent sex scenes, and violence so vivid I was moved to nausea. If you are able to ignore those sorts of things, you will not find yourself feeling any kind of sympathy for the one-dimensional characters. The characters do not develop over the course of the story, and seem only concerned with dabbling in vice. As a result, I was unable to identify with them.A portion of the story is written from the point of view of the main character in his old age. This writing is exceptional, and managed to keep me interested during the course of the book. Still, these marvelous little glimpses of author Sara Gruen's potential do not permit me to recommend this book to anybody. Avoid it.",0
"Sara Gruen seems like a nice person. But this novel is total dreck. The structure reeks of baloney, the ""different"" characters are written with the same bland voice, and the whole melodramatic mess never rises above laughable soap operatics. I'd never want to take enjoyment of this kind of thing away from anyone, but if you've not read it, I'm sure there are better books about the circus out there for you.",0
"Yes, that's not a typo.  Clancy has written a book with over 1,300 pages.  And so it should come as no surprise that I found the story slow. I mean, how many fast paced 1,300-paged books do you know of? And I do mean SLOW.  For those new to the Ryan story to date:  ex-CIA action hero turned cabinet  member turned VP is now president after the prior president is killed in a  suicide bombing run at the end of  Debt of Honor.  Not just the president,  but also just about every other high ranking politico in DC. (Is Clancy  hinting something here?).  Ryan becomes president and must show the  doubters (and those evil media types) that he is a big man and can do the  job.  Of course, Clancy tries not to stray from his reputation as a  techo-guru and so he includes discussions on the investigation into the  terrorist attack as well as a superficially indepth look at militia life (a  group of militia folk decide to go after the President).Since his early  stories, Ryan has become increasingly unlikeable as a character.  He will  occassionally spout off on rhetoric and make long-winded proclamations on  everything from the Russians, so-called &quot;liberals,&quot; femanists, to  the role of women and the media.  This books seems to read like Clancy's  own manifesto, a book where the author injects his own beliefs into the  main character without bothering to be objective.  People who disagree with  these views or Ryan are depicted as the bad guys.  Ryan, it seems, never  makes a mistake: he just has tough choices to make the results of which can  cause the loss of lives.Clancy creates too many subplots and does  surprisingly short shrift with each of them.  This is strange after he has  spent hundreds of pages developing each subplot.  A story about a rival  politician is taken care of in quick order near the end of the book in a  nice, neat package.  Other subplots (a militia group and terrorist group  try to take advantage of the new president) also reach anticlimatic, and  unbelievable, conclusions. (i don't want to give a spoiler, but Ryan  actually orders a military operation to occur at the same time he is live  with a U.S. nation: kinda like a &quot;look, don't mess with us, we are  serious, see what we are doing right this very  second?&quot;Unfortunately, the long journey to the end of the book is  not worth it.  What Clancy needs is an editor, someone who will tell the  guy to cut down his writing.  To get on with it.  And to remember that what  made his earlier books popular was his plot and storylines.  And, of  course, someone should ask Clancy to get off his soapbox.",0
"Only Clancy would make a serial killer the hero of a book.  The truly sad part is how many other characters in professional positions look the other way.  In the past, I have enjoyed Clancy's works.  This one went over the limits good taste.  I added the second star because like many Clancy works it is well written.  I did finish it.  Readers should be cautioned that it is a disturbing concept. In the real world, this hero would be seen as an evil villian of Manson or Gacy dimensions.I will admit a personal bias.  I am a strong supporter and advocate of local police departments.",0
This book was very different from Christie's other writings and I was very excited about reading it.  Unfortunately it was much too dark for me.  SPOILER ALERT--I felt that the story being told by the murderer was horrible and the whole book was a huge disappointment.,0
"I mean really, do we need an explicit sex scene or reference every other chapter?  George's writing has deteriorated to a bizarre medieval sex fantasy.  There is more carnal knowledge in the work than in his entire forst several books combined!  The story line takes place concurrently with the previous work.  We trace Tyrion at first through the expanded eastern lands on a journey to connect with the Dragon Queen.  After several bizarre hand offs, we are left to find him playing a stooge in front of the conquered city of Meereen.  The chapters are tightly written and the internal dialogue of characters is solid.  Theon Greyjoy, Jon Snow and Tyrion are particulalry well fleshed out.  The problem is that Martin seems to turn to extreme profanity, sexual predation and abusive circumstances in his scenes.  This becomes almost ridiculous throughout the book.  A perfect example is the scene in which Ramsay Bolton confronts his new bride in the presnce of the captured and beaten Greyjoy.  Suffice to say that the descriptive natur eof that scene is wholly unnecessary to the plot, establishing Greyjoy's subservience, Jeyne's victimization or the sheer insanity of Bolton.  I am certain this is Mrtin's way of getting the next miniseries installment onto the Playboy channel instead of HBO.",0
"I wanted to try out another adventure writer other than the ones I've been reading. I thought I'd give Clive Cussler a try since I read Raise The Titanic.The setups in the beginning were long-winded and gave absolutely no relation to the story whatsoever till somewhere towards the end of the book. It served to confuse the readers greatly until strangely and coincidentally enough the Dirk Pitt chances upon them.The book is full of male bravado and machoism. It was shameless in the way Clive included himself into the novel as one of the characters searching for the lost ship. At the same time, the people who seem not to die or get injured miraculously is Dirk Pitt. Everyone else he knows dies.The plot itself was very round about, back and forth and linear. I hope the movie would prove a better watch. Otherwise, some interesting facts about survival in the Sahara that's about it.",0
Any early Hill effort which develops so slowly it is better as a sleep aid than a thriller.,0
"This book is only "" informative"" about the subject of "" satanic ritual abuse"" if you are totally unaware of better books about the subject such as ""Satanic Panic"" by Jeffrey Victor. As it is, even considering it's focusing mainly in the UK and that the publishing date is just before this whole hysteria was exposed fully, Boyd makes a few good points but obscures it with piling on claims of people who assert this stuff exists on an underground global scale. I found it painful intellectually to read as Boyd refers to highly biased sources, some since been discredited and when he does mention sources such as FBI profiler Ken Lanning, he neglects to mention anything by these sources that would discount the claims made by SRA proponents.One of the many claims is that people of high influence such as police, doctors, lawyers and so forth are behind the ""satanic abuse"" and that even with the claims of breeders and human sacrifice these "" satanists"" are so clever that they hide all the evidence every time. I find that highly unlikely. Supposed there is "" generational satanism"" yet none of this was made public until after "" Michele Remembers"" and "" Satan's Underground"". Amd of course the legal ""proof"" he uses includes the Richard Ramirez and the other alleged satanic murders, usually carried out by indivduals. If this exists in the scale they claim, where are the child porn, where are the altars and the books, where are the pelvic exams of the alleged ""brood mares"" to prove they gave birth? None are provided. It's all stories and claims, nothing to confirm the details. No physical evidence at all, in fact.Now that we know how this hysteria came about and was perpetuated, how urban legends were thought of as fact, how children have been coerced to believe something is true when in fact it wasn't, and how Lauren Stratford lied and in all these alleged accounts, NONE of them have shown physical evidence of "" Satanic"" cults, a book like this is more akin to fueling the hysteria and sell books rather than actually examining the subject openly.Boyd makes a few errors in his references, maybe not realizing that some of what he used were from sources of dubious credibility. "" File 18""  and "" Jeremiah Films"" are two examples of bad sources who are highly biased.If you want to find ONE book that deals with this subject extensively, ""Satanic Panic"" does a good job of it. For thsoe who have a copy of this book, may I suggest you note the various names cited as "" experts"" and cross check them online, or better yet, get a copy of the book "" Witch Hunts"" by Kerr Cuhulain.Yes pedophiles use "" cult ritual"" to scare their victims. And yes there are cases of people whio claim to be satanists ( usually from rock music or something) committing murder. We have proof of child porn, of pedophiles abd so forth. But we have no proof oif this underground organized satanic ritual abuse claim. And yet we are to believe the victims at their word. Not unlike the ""afflicted girls' at the Salem Witch trials witch their "" spectral"" evidence. This is the same criteria of "" proof"" that we see about the worldwide cabal of "" Zionists"" and the ""New World Order"" and so forth.I am open for objective empirical proof. If you claim your car was changed from a Buick to an elephant, I need to see you owned a Buick and how the elephant appeared in your possession. I also need to examine your account. I need proof other than your story and claims of people with THEIR stories.For the record I am not a Satanist. I am a Wiccan and I highly do NOT like pedophiles nor blood sacrifice. Also may I point out that there have been a number of crimes committed by supposedly devout Christians, even ministers, and credible people do NOT associate the crime with the religion. By the "" proof"" in this book, for example, with all the acocunts of Catholic priests being pedophiles, the assumption ( using the same arguments used in this book) is that the Catholic Church is behind child porn and whatever else claims one wishes to make.I would not consider this an autoritative source. There are too many things wrong with it and of Boyd's dancing around the obvious problems for me to recomend this to anyone other than a knowledgable expert, and that only to point out how bad research and relying upon the wrong sources can lead to more harm than good.",0
"""Most of the crowd at Mallorys Bar & Sleep over in Delta Sector had no idea what was really going on. As far as they were concerned, it was just another example of animal passion, men and women driven together by lust - the kind of thing everybody understood, or at least dreamed about. The only uncommon feature was that in this case the passion included some common sense. Only a few people knew there was more to it....That, of course, was not the real story."" (p. 1-6)The Real Story opens by giving us the general view of what happened between two space pirates over a woman. What we see is bland and predictable. It is not, of course, what really happened. Next we're shown the experts' point of view those same events, probing deeper beneath the surface. That is not the whole picture either, however. Finally, we're shown the real story, played out scene by agonizing and unilluminated scene, and we come to understand the intricacies of Donaldson's creation.Donaldson's central conceit is to begin with a classic Antagonist-Victim-Rescuer triangle and turn it on his head, with Donaldson saying as much in the afterword:""My original intentions were explicitly archetypical. What I had in mind was an aesthetically perfect variation on the basic three-sided story: the story in which a victim (Morn), a Villain (Angus), and a Rescuer (Nick) all change roles...Victimized by Angus, Morn is recued by Nick - but that, of course, is not the real story. The real story has to do with the way in which Nick becomes Angus's victimizer and Morn becomes Angus's rescuer."" (p. 224-225)In this, Donaldson moves with power and subtlety. From the opening, Angus Thermopyle seems a standard villain, vain, greedy, run down, powerful, and all but cackling. As the narrative progresses, however, we come to truly understand (though still revile) him. Morn Hyland's character, on the other hand, doesn't become deeper, but rather shallower, in devastating, heart wrenching, and drawn out torments. The final member of our subverted triangle, Nick, is viewed only on the periphery, for most of the story, but he is handled as well as the other two.There are two main problems with The Real Story, however. The first of them is the sheer grimness of Donaldson's vision. Now, I like dark fiction. I think that, imply what it may about my psyche, the most interesting stories are the ones that hurt the most, that make us reel back and try to shy away. In The Real Story, Donaldson has plenty of that. What he has absolutely none of, however, is contrast. There are no, and I mean that quite literally, uplifting moments in The Real Story. None.This isn't a black and white drama, but I'm not sure if it's necessarily more complex. We aren't talking about that new fad of gray versus black. This isn't even gray versus gray. The Real Story is full on black versus black, pitch battling midnight, with an is-that-black-or-just-a-really-really-dark-gray watching from the sidelines. If black and white morality can be criticized for taking the human element out and exculpating the characters from all meaningful moral choices, this is the same. By painting everyone in an equally despicable light, Donaldson shirks away from any real moral dilemmas to the same degree, no longer a battle between Rand and the Dark One, it's just the Dark One squaring off with Sauron, innocent slaughtering, sadistic, misogynistic pirate versus innocent slaughtering, sadistic, misogynistic pirate.The other major problem with The Real Story results from the interesting opening and increasingly deep conceptions of just what happened. Now, I think that the structure of the book was extremely well done, and I was curious as to just how certain events played out when everything began, but the real story turns out to be far too similar to the experts' conception of it. Yes, over the two hundred pages of narrative we get more motivations, some events that those experts didn't imagine, etc, but on the whole, our initial grasp of what happened is pretty much sufficient to extract all suspense from the story, turning nail biting fight scenes into yeah, I know how this ends. Can we speed things up a tad?The Real Story set out with a very specific concept in mind and succeeded perfectly in its aim. Unfortunately, its narrow focus led to a whole host of other problems, and I'm unsure if that one success really justifies the flaws of the story. I suppose that this volume's worthiness will really depend on the strengths of its sequels. On its own, however, I'd only advise checking out The Real Story if the concept is something you feel you need to read.",0
"I adore Victoria Holt novels. I like the author in all her pen names. But the books attributed to Victoria Holt have always been superior to the rest. They are usually well constructed, with an engrossing plot full of mystery, strong lead characters, and a powerful sense of place. ""Secret for a Nightingale"" lacks all of the above. It is the first Holt book I've been utterly unhappy with.The plot is as thin as mountain air; thinner. It surrounds a young woman who quickly discovers her new husband is not only an opium addict but a proud, self-professed devil worshipper. Tragedy destroys her marriage and she forms a bizarre fixation on the man she's decided to blame: a well-respected doctor and author of several provocative books about his exotic travels. Without any real, legitimate, factual reason, she forms a personal vendetta against him.She is soon joined by not one but three random young girls she passively takes under her wing. The scenarios surrounding these friends are far-fetched in the extreme.The story meanders and plods along. Despite being tangentially important to the action, Florence Nightingale is only talked about; she has zero presence in the story. In fact, nursing in general has little presence. It's merely a vehicle for the heroine to enjoy, in coincidence after coincidence, the way-too-easy ""hunt"" for her sworn enemy, dubbed ""The Demon Doctor.""The love story is usually secondary to the mystery for me in Holt's Gothic novels. But there is no mystery here. Sharp readers will be shocked and annoyed at the transparency. Nor is there the classic house/castle/island/village full of unknowns.The setting jumps all over, and one never really gets a good grasp on any one place.The most far-fetched and badly fleshed out feature of the mess is the love story. Even as you see it coming from chapters away, the narrative fails to deliver a plausible development.The more I think about it, the more ludicrous this novel becomes. From start to finish, it lurches and sways like a drug addict, ending abruptly, but not leaving the reader craving more.Instead of this junk I highly recommend ""Night of the Seventh Moon"", ""The Judas Kiss"", ""The Secret Woman"", and ""The Shivering Sands."" Holt can be masterful with the Gothic romance genre. Here she faltered.",0
"It's tough being a Tudor lover, especially when you're also a European history major. The trashy movies, TV shows, and novels just don't seem to end.But this piece blew me farther away than most with its incredible levels of sensationalist inaccuracy.Why? When history has provided us with such a vibrant tapestry of dynamic, intriguing characters, real people living real lives, why must we reduce them to soap opera depth and dignity?Ordinarily I wouldn't bother with adding to the voices debating this book; there are plenty of people doing that already. But when I saw this:""I recommend this book and all of the Tudor novels written by Philippa Gregory to anyone who loves true historical fiction.""... I had to speak up.To anyone reading: this is NOT TRUE HISTORY! This is trashy, inaccurate drivel! The history of humanity is too deeply thrilling and too important to be obscured by this level of sludge. There is no excuse for this kind of ignorance in the modern age; a quick Internet search can render treasure troves of information like our ancestors could only dream of. Get your historical knowledge from Google, if you like, but not from Gregory.I don't have anything against sensationalist romances. If that floats your boat, great. But I do have issue with the subject I care so passionately for being trampled without apology.So read the book, if you like; enjoy it even. But please, please don't take anything it says to be real history! We deserve to be better informed than this.",0
"This was one of Agatha Christie's &quot;not so good&quot; books. Thankfully there aren't many but they do exist. Perhaps she should not have mixed genres (spy thrillers and crime). Mind you, there isn't a James Bond chase scene in the book but the opening pages takes the reader to a fictional Arab nation on the verge of a coup d etat and sees its young prince exchanging ideas with his English pilot on how to smuggle out the royal jewels.I am not spoiling anyone's surprise when I say the deaths in this novel are connected directly or indrectly to the jewels (which have ended up in a girls school, by the way). The three murders all come rather late in the book and as such the revelation of the culprit by Poirot feels rushed.Yes, the book is touted as a &quot;Hercule Poirot mystery&quot;  although we only get to see him three quarters into the story. Since almost all of the investigation was handled by the local inspector, an undercover Special Branch officer and a very intelligent girl, it would have been better if they tied it all up with no need for Poirot to show up.All in all, I was not impressed with Cat Among the Pigeons. Those new to her work should start with other titles as this one may turn them off Agatha Christie, who was a good mystery writer actually. Her mystery novels usually ends with the reader (me, in this case) gasping and going, &quot;Damn! She's good.&quot;This one didn't. Nuff said.",0
"I picked up the first book and loved it.  The second book was okay...but didn't have a purpose beyond expanding the story...then we got into books three to five.  Great stories...but no reason for them...new characters coming out of the wood work and not advancing the plot.  This last book was hopelessly the worse one yet...nothing happened and the characters never got beyond doing stuff...To be honest George R.R. Martin is a great writer and should stick to short stories, or he needs to go back to writing 101 and learn to develop a novel...or just go back to book one...he did so much better there.",0
"Ok, I'm a true Gregory fan. I always have been since ""Wideacre"" but I mean...come on!Her other books were exciting and made me want to keep reading! This one...it fell very, very short. I just couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters. Yes, reading about how all the slaves were treated was heart-wrenching, but I get it. I would like to have some sort of plot to go along with that.When I did get a plot, it was a slow moving and dull one. I knew what was going to happen before it did and that just made it even more boring. Gregory used to have such flare! What happened here?",0
"I found this book fairly well crafted, but did not believe in the characters or the story, which seemed awfully thin and contrived. The author admits in a postscript that she borrowed extensively from old newspaper stories and made up composite characters based on real-life people and animals, which is close to plagiarism if you ask me. The main character, Jacob, who is 93, and tell the story in flashbacks, is much too lucid for his age to be credible, and Marlena, the woman he eventually steals, comes across as flat and uninteresting.Like other reviewers, I found the dialogue artificial and at times anachronistic. Haven't seen the movie but not much source material to work with.",0
"This book starts in a manner which is rare within any novel: it summarizes the entire story in a span of less than three pages. Then Donaldson informs the reader that is not ""the real story"". The second chapter goes into more detail of what observers of those engaged in the adventures assumed had occurred, but, again, Donaldson informs the reader once again that there is another ""real story"". The third chapter finally starts into ""the real story"".I was hooked by this simple segue into telling a story. And I actually enjoyed 'getting to know' the characters - and characters they are, characters I enjoy getting to know at a distance, but not really up close and personal.Overall, this book was okay. But, in reading the author's afterword (which I recommend for anyone picking this book up) he explains how this book serves more as an introduction to these characters whom the reader will get to know much more extensively in the books which follow. On that level, it seems to be an excellent book if you look at it from that angle. Even so, it still felt slightly anti-climactic to me.I do feel that Donaldson, at least in Angus' case, chose to use the character's sexuality to expose the character's depravity. There were several passages which made me really question if that was the best route to take in revealing how messed up Angus was.  It just made it really hard to enjoy the story.Do I recommend it? Not really. If you want to read the rest of the books in the series, it probably is the best place to start within the series, regrettably so.",0
"Game of Thrones was one of my all time favorite series when it first issued, full of hope and promise in a unique world of (not so) courtly knights trumped by incestuous twins, dragons and shapeshifters.  Like Robert Jordan (Wheel of Time)  Martin's plotting skills are not up to his world building, and Book 5 is the worst kind of Anticlimax -- full of enough foreshadowing to make the fate of the few survivors predictable.  Kind of a core dump of unused backstory and long winded mico detail, wrapped around limited plot advancement which consists mainly of &#34;wrapping up&#34; loose ends by ending their existence.  Considering all that culminated in Book 4, this would be a good one to skip and see if Book 6 emerges, and if so, does better.",0
"This book came recommended to me by a couple of friends, but I won't recommend it to anyone else as long as there are plenty of other decent books to read out there.It was relatively engaging in that I wasn't bored.  And it has a lot of potential.  But when I reflected on the story as a whole, I realized it didn't accomplish anything interesting, significant, intelligently complex.  I found it absolutely laughable that it had book club discussion questions at the end. For the life of me, I don't know what there is to dissect, analyze, or discuss about it!I never felt emotionally connected to any of the characters, except for the old man's musings at the beginning on growing old and being ignored by family in the midst of their own busy-ness.  Frankly, I was surprised that the love story ended up the way it did because I didn't realize the ""love story"" part of it was actually to be taken seriously.  The couple was so flat and void of chemistry.I didn't appreciate that the book started with a future event only to get to that actual part of the story and learn that it was quite different from what the prologue led me to believe.  That kind of fake-out should be reserved for 1-hour TV shows, not books.  It was sloppy and it set me as the reader on the wrong course for the rest of the book.About 2/3 of the way through the book, I was just pushing through to finish it and say I finished it.  Sometimes a book can redeem itself in the end, but this ending was too ridiculous for redemption.I've read some good modern fiction recently, but this doesn't make the list.  It's a real shame it's going to get a bump in revenue because of the movie -- and because it's a Robert Pattinson movie at that.  (sigh)",0
"Okay. I'm done.No more Song of Ice and Fire books for me. After trying to follow the characters that I was supposed to remember from volumes #1 through #4, and doing a fair job of it while studying blow-ups of the tiny maps at the front of the book, I decided the effort wasn't worth it. Yes, I still care whether or not Arya regains her sight, Jon succeeds in defending the broken kingdoms from the evils descending upon them from beyond the wall, Tyrion finds his true love, Caytlin is reunited with her children, the direwolfs find their masters, Bran reaches his goal, and Daenerys finally rides a dragon. But honestly, the bloated writing and over-the-top cruelty and violence do not compel me to continue reading anymore.Someone, please give me a summary of what happens at the end of Volume #6 or #7 or #8, or whichever one is the end, and I'll be happy.",0
"I am a Clancy Fan from the start. have read all of his books, have his computer game etc. I got bogged down on page 308 of 875 and never went back. A good editor could have knocked off 200+ pages easily. It did not have the snap of &quot;Sum of All Fears&quot; or his first two novels. Instead it had  way too many subplots, a fairly ( for Clancy, boring main plot, and too much stuffing in between. If you doubt me, read one of his first two novels, and then big up this behemoth and see if you can finish it! If you have not read his non-fiction books on &quot;Submarine&quot;, &quot;Marine&quot; , &quot;Armored Cav&quot;, and the non-fiction account of Desert Storm, and you are a military junkie, don't miss them!

"There is a story to me buying this book. I had never read clancy before November of 2002 (right now I am reading Bear and the Dragon and I have read them all to this point). When I first saw Executive Orders on a shelf in Albertson's, I figured: long book, a lot of points for a book report. So I bought it. I go home, open it up, and read the description. And it was there that I saw I needed to read Debt of Honor first. Later I realized that this book was part of a series. Okay, now for the review.The book was long. The beginning is okay, as it concludes Debt of Honor, but most of the rest of the book is boring and extremely long winded. The majority of it is spent with Ryan whining about how he hates being president. Another problem is the Ed Keality story line. In goes hot and heavy for awhile, then it disappears and ends in a simple manner that makes one wonder in Clancy just got bored. The same is true of the sub-plot about the Mountain men - it goes nowhere. You have at leat two-hundred pages devoted tot hem, then they disappear, only to have no effect on the main story (and I mean this in the most literal sense). It truly goes absolutely nowhere, yet he writes the leads for as if it will be the big conclusion, and maybe cause this novel to end like Debt of Honor.One thing I enjoyed was that Clark and Chavez got a decent amount of time in the book. They have become my favorite characters in the Ryan universe, and so I always looked forward to their coming.Now, this book has too many subplots to count, most of which are pointless. The disease helps set up Rainbow Six, as does the key climax help show who Clark is again. Aside from that, is is obvious that clancy wrote this to set a personal record for page length.To end, as this is one of my most poorly written reviews, a lot of this book is a set up for the Bear and the Dragon (where you learn further that despite saying other wise, Ryan does not have respect for others nor does he take into account -- this is noticed in this paper weight as well -- that some of his actions are truly unconstitutional). I'm sorry Clancy, but I was disappointed. Stick to things that are good. You prefer to make us know you have a greater intelligence than us when dealing with governemnt policies and military strategies. We knew this since Red October.I recomend finding cliffnotes on this novel, or skipping this novel entirely. It is better to go back to the Cardinal of the kremlin and The Sum of All Fears, or skip ahead to Rainbow Six.What else can I say except that I am looking forward to when Jack Ryan dies. Too much has been written about this man whose luck would get him thrown out of Las Vegas, and after becoming president, he'll never be able to go on any adventures (Red October, Cardinal, Clear and present) again.",0
I didn't read Sydney Sheldon in my teens in the nineties when all around me were devouring them. I just stuck my nose up at that popular culture. It was only last year 2013 that I decided to see what all the fuss had been about. Master of the Game was alright in the way you'd expect a popular paperback to be. But this one If Tomorrow Comes was utter nonsense and ridiculous-in fact down right irritating. I do not recommend this book to anyone with an IQ rating of above 1.5,0
"In a time of difficulties and in a place where exotic things are a rule, Sara Gruen sets her novel ""Water for elephants"". The story starts with moment of violence and from then on is tolerable narrative mess. The main character is a veterinarian student who drops school, joins a circus during the Depression-era, finds love, hate and whatever may crosses his way.The lessons he learns are so valuable that decades later, living in a home for old people, he can still perfectly recall them - and pass them along. He is Jacob, a strange figure, who is no longer an alien when he runs into people even stranger than him. Tod Browning's movie ""Freaks"" comes to mind, but Gruen never reaches the same level.The only redeeming point in the book are the old black and white circuses pictures with scenes from a bygone era. On the other hand, Gruen's heavy-handed prose lacks the sparkling that would enhance ""Water for elephants"". Her storytelling abilities are more focused in the tell - when it should be the showing - missing the chance of creating a whimsical story. We learn every step Jacob takes from a to c, even the unnecessary b. With card-board flat characters, the aninals end up stealing the show. These excesses tone down the narrative and keep the novel from reaching a higher artistic level.",0
"Too many characters, too many pages, too much of nothing!  The first three titles in the series were outstanding.  A combination of books four and five minus at least a half dozen characters and some serious editing would have made one good novel.

"Dazed... uncertain... SER GEORGE stumbled through the wilderness.His plans were as ruined as LORD TYWIN'S groin. All the sellswords he'd hired had capriciously abandoned him to pursue their own deviant agendas.THE OTHERS, for instance, were supposed to be the Primary Villains of the series. Unfortunately, they weren't very villainous; instead, they proved to be borderline retarded. In eight thousand years, not one of them had realized they could build boats, sail around the Wall, and thus transform it into a Westerosian Maginot Line. Instead, they hung out in the Haunted Forest and said ""Boo"" every so often.JON SNOW could no longer remember why he was in the book or what he was supposed to do. Each time a decision was required of him, as Lord Commander of the Watch, he did the least responsible, most goofy thing he, or anyone, could imagine. Somebody was apparently sneaking funky stuff into JON's ranger brownies.DANY TARGARYEN was even more forgetful. She could not remember where Westeros was or what she had ever wanted to do with it.  Instead, she became a slutty bureaucrat, possibly because that's the kind of character fantasy readers invariably love the most.  SER GEORGE was very annoyed with DANY and totally wanted his money back.TYRION LANNISTER was still funny but showing signs of Other-like retardation. Someone had told him ""You should hide in a wine keg and be transported to the Free Cities, but you don't need to know which one, nor do you need to have any money or friends when you get there."" And TYRION -- quite unlike himself -- had said ""Brilliant! This is the best possible plan! Sign me up.""BRAN STARK had the only subplot in which Things Were Happening! Therefore, SER GEORGE, who had no idea what to do with interesting subplots, abandoned it halfway through the book.THE OTHER STARK KIDS (including JON SNOW) were all of a sudden transformed into skinchangers, who could not only link mentally with their own direwolves in dreams, but also other animals, including, presumably, human beings. They had just never noticed that, or gotten around to it before... somehow.CERSEI LANNISTER was bald. This might have been interesting, but DANY had beaten her to the punch and gotten bald first. (At one point, SER GEORGE considered naming the book A BALDNESS OF QUEENS.)  DANY going bald also meant that she couldn't tug on her braid.QUAITHE flat-out sucked. Given twenty seconds to answer questions, she didn't even try to warn DANY of the most daunting threat imaginable... that readers were getting bored.EVERYONE INVOLVED WITH WINTERFELL was grumpy. Snow fell; they were cold and hungry. Whatever.THE DRAGONS were getting big and fat and dragon-y, but despite the book title, nobody was doing anything with them, so there really wasn't much point in their being in the story. This upset their tummies.Even THE PLOT, once Ser George's most trusted comrade, had vanished into the fog, seemingly never to return.What was SER GEORGE to do?",0
"On the back cover of the book a journalist states that Martin is the closest thing America has to Tolkien.  While Tolkien's work will be cherished by readers for years to come, this series has little chance of being a book of all time. It has nothing of the epic nature of the LOTR--except its length.  A better comparison of this work would be with the ""Wheel of Time"" series. Neither brings the story to any resolution at any point. This, to this reader, is the most frustrating element of this series in an often frustrating read.Martin stated he would finish the series at book 4; book 4 stretched on in to book 5. Book 5, however, is not a conclusion. The story just stops. It doesn't take a prophet to see that more books will be coming from Martin in this series. I will make a personal prophetic utterance at this point: Though I will read several hundreds of books before I leave this mortal coil, another book in the Song of Ice and Fire series will not be one of them.",0
"I would not recommend Phillipa Gregory's much-hyped The Other Boleyn Girl. I'm the sort of person who keeps reading a book that doesn't make a good first impression, hoping it'll improve. Some six-hundred pages later, I realized The Other Boleyn Girl never got good. Please don't waste your time! Gregory summed up executions of significant characters with lines such as ""He was executed the next day."" Nothing triggers any emotional response in the reader! It's extraordinary. It seems as though Gregory went out of her way to make this possible.Of course, it's a matter of opinion. I simply found it to be void of anything of substance. I wasn't made to care about the characters or how the events played out. And only sex carried the plot along!Also, I think a good amount of the book was from Gregory's imagination, not historical facts. I'm not trying to suggest Anne was never executed or she didn't have a sister or anything of the sort. And I know in this genre much is left to the author's imagination and interpretation; it has to be. It's not as though there's a record of everything that was said and done by everyone surrounding any given event in history. But Gregory herself, when asked how she researches for her books, said she first goes to secondary sources. She never mentioned using primary sources. Yes, they can be biased (if they're from someone's perspective they're going to be), but they're first-hand accounts. Who better knows how something played out than a person who was in the middle of it, witnessing it? In addition, her dialogue is inconsistent. It's ridiculously modern at some points, then flowery at others. I know it can't be written Shakespeare-style; it has to be readable and understandable. But I think we could be a little more sophisticated! No one said ""stuff"" back then, for example, as in, ""All this stuff is making me mad."" She couldn't work a little harder than that??If you want the stereotypical historical fiction whose foundation is built on fancy dresses, sex, and scandal, this soap-opera mimic is perfect. If you're like me and want to learn something in the process, however...As I've made obvious, I was sorely disappointed. Just thought I'd pass my warning along. I don't want anyone else wasting his time!",0
"This was such an exciting series, so much foreshadowing, hints of plots to come, intrigues to play out. The problem is that none of it ever happens. This author has no plan. He just writes very well but I don't think he even remember book one. Tolkien he's not. Too bad.",0
"I am a fan of the ""Song of Ice and Fire"" series, I even think ""Feast for Crows"" is a brilliant book; unfortunately I cannot say the same about ""A Dance with Dragons"". To be short: the fifth book in the series cannot be compared to the previous four. Sadly, I have to say, ""A Dance with Dragons"" kills almost all the forward momentum of the first four books :-((The following sections contain spoilers, beware.)What's wrong with this book? Almost everything. First of all, it was a very bad idea to go back to the time of the events of ""Feast for Crows"". The first half of the book covers the same period as the ""Feast for Crows"". This part is simply boring. The second half of the book is more interesting but the events we are told about simply do not fit into the big picture. The worst part about ""A Dance with Dragons"" is that almost all the characters lost their wits and their behavior is simply stupid. Let's discuss some details.- Daenerys - the change in her in the book is just nonsense, her decisions are simply stupid; the wise and compassionate future queen of Westeros became a gullible, hysterical, lazy and wanton girl. And Meereen is not interesting, it is simply annoying, all the characters we get to know in this city are selfish and disgusting, and anyway, who cares about the Slavers' Bay? Does it have any connections with the main story? It has none. At least, in the end Daenerys leaves this wretched city...- Quentyn Martell - his story, for me, was the biggest mistake in the whole series. We read a lot about Dorne and the scheming of Doran Martell in the previous book. At the end of the previous book it was revealed that the big secret is that the prince of Dorne is sent to Daenerys. Wow, it could have been interesting... Major spoiler here: all this fuss about Dorne, the sand snakes, Arys Oakheart and so on, what is the result of all this? Quentyn dies without any result whatsoever, he and all the Dornish scheming achieved absolutely nothing! This part is really frustrating because why invest a lot into a detailed, and good story? Just to give an abrupt and stupid ending? I am not against killing off the characters, I was blown away by the Red Wedding, because it made sense, Quentin's story is simply unnecessary.- Prince Aegon - did this new twist in the story add anything to the big picture? No, on the contrary. The more new characters we have, the more likely it becomes that a lot of side stories will not be wrapped up at the end. Are Aegon an his companions interesting characters? Unfortunately, the answer is no. Up until this fifth book Martin managed to avoid most of the fantasy clich&eacute;s, Aegon and his team is simply too bland, and mostly unnecessary and clich&eacute;d (the good but spoilt prince with his loyal and wise counselor is one of the biggest fantasy clich&eacute;). Was the story in such a dire need for another contender for the iron throne?I could continue with all the characters in the book, none of them moved forward. Even Tyrion, who is still the best character in the book, became shallow. And what about this girl dwarf? Really?Yes, I am angry with this book, because the first four books were masterpieces, this one is ordinary. I cannot give it more than two stars.",0
"I know I'm the odd person out here, because virtually all the reviews are favorable &amp; some consider this work a &quot;classic&quot;, but, frankly, I didn't like this book.  And, mind you, I like war novels &amp; have read many of them.  This book is unrelievedly gloomy &amp; depressing &amp; gets more so as the book goes on.  There is way too much description &amp; not enough conversation.  Contrary to what several reviewers said, I found the character development weak to nonexistent.  There were some interesting characters &amp; I would have liked to know more about them, but the characters took second place to endless descriptions of the weather &amp; damage reports.  I plowed through it because I thought it was my duty to do so, but really, I found this book disappointing.",0
"Long descriptions of characters and places never before heard of.  I assume that somewhere down the line these places and characters will be brought back into the story, but the characters we were following were no where to be seen for a good portion of the beginning of the book.  The ending, of course, ends with us wondering what happens to the characters we know and love.  Now I wonder just how many books there are coming and if it's worth continuing to follow the series.",0
"This novel is very slow moving, repetitve and it is totally lacking in charm or suspense.  There was not enough material for a novel in this story.  Poor Poirot!  Poor reader.  Skip this one.",0
"My opinion of this book keeps wandering back and forth without really getting anywhere, like a fair number of its characters. Nevertheless, here's a road map so far--During initial readthrough: ""Cannot... stay... awake. Too... many... turtles."" (~3 stars)Occasionally interspersed mid-read and lingering afterward: ""What the hell were those bogus plot twists? Most of this book could've been titled 'Dancing with Godot' wrt plots/characters stagnating and going retrograde, and the few apparent bits of supposed plot development came out of nowhere."" (~2 stars)Developing over the next few weeks of reading fan discussion forums: ""Hey, I didn't catch all those little details about dangerous dining (mushroom soup and wedding pie) and stuff like that-- that's pretty cool."" (~4 stars)Drifting downward again as I struggled to actually re-read the book itself but got bogged back down in the Meereeenese quagmire: ""Y'know, I don't enjoy spending time in Westeros/Essos anymore. In previous books, I thought this world was grim and backstabby, but it was grim and backstabby in an interesting way and I wanted to see how it changed the characters who managed to survive. But now I'm starting to lose interest in those characters, especially since the past two books (like Buffy season 6) have been about everyone 'learning to fail'-- which may be important and necessary life lessons, but they're not my idea of entertainment. And on reflection, I kinda resent that most of my actual enjoyment of this book had to be crowdsourced by proxy, via reading other people's pickups of the significance of otherwise throwaway lines.""So if you factor in the online crowdsourcing forums, I'd be willing to average the book up to 3 stars.But my rating for the book itself remains bottomed out at two.",0
"Spoiler alert....and descriptions of graphic bodily functions etc. I give it one star, as a grace...compared to his other books in this series. But as a stand alone book...it doesn't deserve one star at all. ZERO for me.We purchased this book because both my hubby and I enjoyed the series so far.  I personally did not like Book 4, however.It has taken me almost 4 months to finish this volume.  Why?  Because it is so God awfully MORBID!  GAD...one would need psychiatric counseling or antidepressants at least to enjoy this book. So I trudged along at about 20 pgs a night...put it aside...tried again and again. Hubby kept saying...stick with it... it gets ""better"". Well it doesn't.  Some chapters, actually seem like the older volumes. Then the slag begins again. Boring, endless new dead end characters, pus, gore, stink, monkeys throwing feces, vomiting, blood, burning, eyeballs exuding liquids (poor Prince Martell). Poor Dany... she is vomiting like the rest of them!I have reached my maximum ability to tolerate ""realism"" where Martin is concerned.  Does every page, every chapter have to have gruesome, endlessly detailed morbid descriptions of body functions, injuries, behaviors, murders?We purchased this book on Amazon...and sent it to our vacation destination. What a huge mistake. Don't read this book if you are looking to relax, or have a good time. It will drag you down, and poison your days and possibly your dreams.I can't see any of this book on movie or TV media.  How would it translate?  Good Grief!I do think RR Martin is a talented writer (from his earlier books). But this stuff?  NOPE....it is just sensationalism and depressing.",0
"The first three books in this series are fantastic.  I loved every word.  The fourth, I struggled with...and was very frustrated when NOTHING happened!This was the same.  So much was packed into the first three books, and these last two could have been shrunk to a single chapter each.I won't buy any more in this series....I'm moving on",0
"What started out as a seemingly great new epic fantasy more than 10 years ago now has become something akin to the Star Wars prequels. Just an unmitigated disaster. The series did have problems from the start but they were originally outweighed by the positives: GRR Martin's writing ability and his imagination. Sadly, slowly the problems have overcome anything that was once good about this story.The story has many different points of view that change, disappear, and reappear as the story churns ever on. There is plenty of smut and people can die in sudden twists (and then magically come back! yipee!). That is the same way a soap opera works. Grr Martin is a good writer though. By the middle of this book, Grr Martin's good writing is a dead horse and the soap opera has been beating it all night and all morning (imagine a morning that lasts several days - oh wow man). The horse is just basically a red smear on the ground. The Dany chapters literally vomit out a never ending list of bizarre names and forgettable characters. Does anyone truly feel like they know these characters beyond a sorta pikachu card like depth? While this list of characters scrolls through, instead of feeling as if this is part of some grand story we feel confined to a small and boring court. While on the other hand, every freaking meal is described in detail. The sex scenes are creepy smut from a man who is not experienced with women. Asha is so hollywood badgirrrl it makes me want to puke. What a boring and flat character. Not to mention completely useless. Some characters have shown some growth which is quite the feat for just a couple thousand pages! Sansa learned how to care about others and scheme. Oh but she disappeared a couple books ago I think... Oh well! Bring in the tough bad girrrls! Yeah, she's got a double bladed axe and knows how to use it! She acts like the women in Martin's favorite pornos! His dream come true. And talk about hollywood, how about the endless it's-a-small-world-after-all moments Tyrion has as he meets other characters by chance? And another 'did that character really die?' cliffhanger. Wow, really treading some new ground there. Maybe The Bold and The Beautiful is looking for new writers?Another battle of good vs evil within Grr Martin's story is between his colorful imagination and his stupid ideas. One of the original, oh-wow-man's was the seasons lasting several years. A year is really the time for one cycle through the seasons so this sorta inside out nonsensical idea where our year, which does not fit in this fantasy world, is applied to their passing of time is just kinda cross-eyed dumb and silly. But whatever, the way it affects the fantasy is interesting and the color of the imagined is more than the stupidity of the idea. But the ideas jumped the shark with the unsullied as has been pointed out by others. Super Darwin eunuch fighters that can't feel anything (sardaukar/spartan/janissaries smashed together sans manhoods plus numbness - just look at that and consider it). Wow, I dunno about you but I'm terrified. To be honest, I've always imagined these guys as comical so when the Sons of the Harpy get them... I. Don't. Care. But in this book, there aren't that many new ideas. Warging is when people can control animals and is explored more. I wonder where that is going? Hmmm. Tree humpers (aka greenseers) are very rare people that can hump trees and see the past. So kewl! What a climax to Bran's story! Like the Force coming from intracellular bacteria!Add to all this some thrown in lines from Monty Python's like ""fart in your general direction"" for good measure and you have a big time hit! Maybe Grr himself sees the whole series as a big stupid joke at this point? He doesn't really seem to care. Whatever, you'll buy it. Rated Arg for Pirate, f you.",0
What happened to Bran? Rickon? Sansa? Arya is a cutthroat child living across the narrow sea? Daenarys just flies off on a dragon?I don't see how you could say that this book was three bitches and a bastard after prattling on and on about nothing and leaving your readers hanging.I won't be fooled by you again!,0
Thought I would never get through this book but kept at it expecting some answers only to discover there are 2 more books. I think I'm done.,0
"I will start by saying that the book is entertaining.....if you care nothing about historical accuracy, you'll probably really enjoy it!  Gregory took what is an incredibly interesting topic and turned it into a sleazy, tabloid read.  Gregory just twisted or omitted facts to suit her novel and that really annoyed me.  It is widely recognized that Mary is older than Anne.  There is no proof that either of Mary's children are Henry VIII's. When Anne banished Mary from court, Mary never returned, but in the book, she is summoned back and witnesses Anne's downfall.  Completely inacurate.  I found it appalling that in the book, Mary even sends Anne a letter while she is in the Tower. I've read many Tudor experts say that Mary never contacted either George or Anne at all after they were taken to the Tower, and Mary's daughter Catherine most certainly was not there.  Also, it is commonly accepted that King Henry declared Anne the care of Henry Carey after his father died, there is no evidence to support that Anne demanded him and ""stole"" him from Mary.  The author just adds in these ridiculous tidbits to continually portray Anne as some crazy, horrible shrew. Gregory put several known lies about Anne in the book. There is also no historical evidence that Anne gave birth to a ""deformed monster"", nor that it was fathered by her brother George.  I felt this was a cheap way to ""dirty"" up the novel to make it more interesting.  Upon her own execution later, Jane Parker admitted she lied about George and Anne Boleyn's alleged incestuous affair.  So I don't think Gregory had any reason to insinuate that it actually happened other than to make her novel juicier.  I can't respect that at all.  I concede not much is known about Mary Boleyn, so it must have been challenging to create a whole book from her perspective, I just wish Gregory had respected the widely accepted facts from the era and not basically made her own cheapened version of history.  What saddens me is that a lot of people who don't know much about the Tudor era will accept much of this novel as fact when it is not.",0
"The Library Journal describes ONLY FORWARD as an ""...sf action thriller in a color-coded near future, where independent neighborhoods vie for dominance in a dangerous and deadly high-tech world."" Well, I actually read ONLY FORWARD and, while there are neighborhoods that are very distinctive, there wasn't much vying for dominance going on, nor is this what I would call a ""thriller"". It was mostly a live-and-let-live arrangement among the neighborhoods, and any excitement generated in the first part of the book was dissipated in the vapid second part.The neighborhoods are all featured primarily in the first part of ONLY FORWARD, wherein Stark (the main character) tries to locate and bring home missing technologist Fell Alkland. This part of the book is mildly amusing, but suffers from a degree of predictability. Moreover, the neighborhood concept suffers from a lack of internal consistency, which makes it hard to take seriously. One, for example, is controlled by gangs and completely chaotic, with killings and destruction the order of the day. The trouble with such a ""neighborhood"" is that it would be reduced to an uninhabitable pile of rubble within a very short time. Another ""neighborhood"" exists in total isolation; walled off from its neighbors and keeping its citizens in total  ignorance of the existence of an outside world. Hard to figure how this is managed when it becomes clear that the neighborhood is (surprise) not self-sufficient and must trade with other neighborhoods to maintain itself. Inconsistencies such as these are  common in the first half of the book.The latter part of ONLY FORWARD throws the unsuspecting reader into Jeamland. Jeamland is a fanciful dreamworld; a surreal vision conjured up out of thin air that, like a dream, has no internal consistency. Indeed, the Jeamland environment shifts with the slippery ease of an oil-slick on the surface of a running stream. There's a lot of action here, but it isn't particularly compelling because the prevailing reality changes  at the whim of certain characters and it's hard to accept that one character can be harmed by another character's dream.Some folks apparently really like this book. It's even won awards. Not in my Jeamland, however (in my Jeamland, I just won the Lotto and I'm off to Sacramento to claim my prize). I confess that I'm mystified as to what folks see in it. Someone wrote about ONLY FORWARD that ""...the story blazes with visionary intensity."" Well, there may be some intensity (if you can get past the absurdity), but there's nothing visionary about it. Very little of what it contains could possibly occur in any imaginable reality. In fact, this isn't science fiction at all. It's fantasy of the most extreme sort. Even Tolkien's fantasy world is internally consistent and functions by some recognizable rules. Little of that exists here; none in Jeamland.""Properly warned ye be, says I."" The first part of ONLY FORWARD was far-fetched and predictable, but worth three stars in my book. I found the Jeamland part more mind-numbing than mind-bending, though. If surrealism is your cup of tea, go for it. At least you've been warned about what you're getting into. But, if your reading tastes are anything like mine, this is a two star book. You're on your own.",0
This book just wasn't my cup of tea.  It was recommended by a friend that usually has the exact same taste in books I do.  There isn't anything specific I can say except I didn't like it.,0
"I didn't like it--too depressing--killings, , blood, war--who needs it, even if t was Hemmingway.  The main character in the book, Robert, may have been a self study of Hemmingway himself!!",0
"As with the other reviewers that gave this work a low rating, I am also a fan.Perhaps, as some have said, it is the departure from the much loved Poirot, Marple and even Tommy and Tuppence that makes this a less than enjoyable read.In any event, the book started out fine but soon found its' way into a plot that was so convoluted and unbelievable that I finally gave up.I did skip to the end and found that even there, the wrap-up was nothing that gave me reason to regret the time I saved by not reading the remainder of the book.",0
"I've come late to the Flashman series, having only found out that George MacDonald Fraser has written some dozen books with Flashy in the lead.  I'd never heard of him or his title character until reading a review of a new book in the series in Entertainment Weekly.  So where to begin with so many titles to choose from?  At the beginning usually helps.  Other reviewers have rated this, the first, as still the best, so I felt comfortable with my decision.  And the book is good.  It just didn't resonate with me and so I was looking forward to it ending.  Back when I bought the first one I had hoped that I would enjoy it so much that I would go right out and buy the next one in line.  But alas, no, not for me.  Flashman is a rogue and a scoundrel and a cheat and a  liar and even a rapist, and the story leaps from one wild adventure to the next, with plenty of action and skin-of-the-teeth escapes and daring-do exploits.  But for all that there was nothing to really keep my interest.  Maybe the flaw was mine, but now I remember why I haven't read a historical novel since James Michener.  What I did find interesting was that even today, much like in England's colonial times, countries are still fighting over the dirt parking lot with mountains that is Afghanistan, and losing their shirts.",0
"WOAH, I'm not sure why this book is so highly rated but I couldn't even continue reading it. Very draging and boring to me. Made it to chapter four and had to stop.",0
The protagonist is not convincingly portrayed. He impresses as a bit dull. Somehow he acted without characteristics that justify his actions.,0
"I thought this was an interesting read until the author decided to label the villian of the piece as a paranoid schizophrenic.  August was cruel, sadistic and had violent mood swings.  None of these are symptoms of schizophrenia.  He did not hear voices, have complicated delusions, or an inability to keep touch with reality.  Unlike most unmedicated schizophenics, August had no trouble  thinking rationally or logically, on the contrary, he was in charge of a large section of the circus and exhibited fine organizational skills!The writer could simply have portrayed her character, August, as a jealous, violent man but instead she chose to advance the false stigma that people with schizophrenia are horribly cruel and violent or that they have a ""split"" personality. If only Gruen had researched psychiatry as well as she had the circus.I work with people who suffer from this disease.  While, without medication the patients delusions might possibly, rarely, lead them to do something violent, it's usually in relationship to fear associated with a delusion -- thinking a person is really an alien from outerspace, for example.  Never the sort of cold-blooded violence August engaged in.  August always knew exactly who or what he was hurting.When medicated, people with schizophrenia are actually less likely to commit violent acts than the general population.It's truly a shame when a popular book spreads stigma in this manner, the negative ripple effects go on and on.",0
"As a kid, I always classified Dean Koontz as the 'suspense' guy, Stephen King the 'scary' guy, and Herbert the 'sex and gore' guy. I loved his stuff - screwing in the woods one minute, guts being eaten by rats the next. I've not read him in 20 years, however, and was drawn to '48 by a dust jacket that seemed to promise a pretty interesting scenario. Unfortunately, the scenario is all this terrible book has to recommend it.I don't know if Herbert was just having a very bad day or if his writing has always been this bad. The 'story', what little there is, consists of being chased, getting caught, being chased again then winning - no suspense, no twists and turns, no suprises, no excitement, no gore, no sex. I would never have belived that my beloved James Herbert could have written a boring book, but with '48 he's managed it. In addition to such sins, he writes from the first person perspective of an American GI while failing to find a remotely believable American voice for him.On a seperate note, Herbert really needs to get himself another editor. '48 contains more typos than any book I've ever read from a mainsteam publisher. For example: ""That suited me line"", ""the back of Iris head hit the floor"", ""the husband was sewing in the forces"", ""creeping Up on us"", ""a dent in Iris twisted logic"".A grave dissappointment from a childhood favorite.",0
"""Passenger to Frankfurt"" is quite possibly the worse book I ever finished. I've read worse books that I gave up on in frustration but this had Agatha Christie's name on it. She was a great writer. I love her stuff. Agatha wouldn't let me down. Wow was I wrong.Set in the 1960's this is a serious departure from her usual drawing room mysteries. Stafford Nye, a man working from Britain's Foreign office is approached by a woman in need of help at Frankfurt airport. After helping her out he is determined to meet her again and is rewarded by being indoctrinated into a secret government clique trying to find out about secret organization that seems to be behind the youth movement, taking flower power to anarchical violence. So far so good. Agatha is dipping into the world of James bond you think, but then it all goes wrong and I mean ALL.Stafford is quickly taken to the alpine schloss of Charlotte a grossly fat woman who is a major player in the movement but the schloss, followers etc falling into a Wagnerian/neo-Nazi theme seems more like a Bond movie villain, gross and over the top and you have no idea how she is a `hidden' leader since everyone knows about her. From there Stafford drops out of the picture as the reader is given the insight to various government cabinet meetings by way of plot exposition which says the world is going to hell in a hand basket as the youth movement is unifying countries, destroying airports etc etc. and yet old ladies easily travel about Europe oblivious to all this.Individual scenes hold up. Christie can write dialogue and set things out but the connection between the scenes, the development of the plot, they are not `bad' they are non-existent. Imagine watching a James Bond film and half way through, you stop following Bond and the entire film is then seen from Miss Moneypenny's desk and you will have a reasonable idea of what a frustrating mess this is.At first you think maybe it was Dame Agatha making a comment on the `hippies' of the 60's she didn't understand but this soon slips by the boards and by the last page you realize there isn't an end. You have no resolution or even an understanding if there was a resolution off stage. It's as if there were *many* other chapters but Christie forgot to send them to the printer.In the end this is a mess, a waste of time and money and talent that should never have seen the light of day. An early departure from her usual style as she steps into the world of Ian Fleming starts out well but half way through it completely falls apart. If you love mysteries, if you love spy stories, if you love Agatha Christie if you love the freaking spoken word-stay the hell away from this mess!",0
"The worst book I have read in ten years.Over priced, over hyped.Two thirds of this book should have been edited and left on the floor.This is the best that Mr. Martin can do after 6 years? If so, please let it be the last.This was one of the most eagerly awaited books in years and a major flop.The book like the last couple he has wrote was hard to read.The reader must be committed to the story, devote endless hours to the book for NO ending.Way, way, way, to many twists and turns,to many people, places, things,that have to be remembered.Mr Martin, it does not need 50 pages on how a spoon looks or another 30 on how the person raised it to his mouth to eat. Not to mention that is ok to leave some of the good guys alive.I don't mind killing off the main subject from time to time but you have pushed this to the limit. I have purchased his other 4 books and was ok with them, some better then others.This is my last book that I intend to buy from him.",0
"A long wait and so disappointing. The book was wordy and overly descriptive. How much detail do we really need when a person is eating... I don't really care about what the people are eating, I want a progressive plot. Unless the food is somehow moving the plot along, I just don't care. This goes as well for the lengthy deep thinking done by many of the characters, which actually come out as a lot of woe is me. The book could have been cut by 400 words. I found myself drifting off a lot, or skimming quickly through pages to get back to the plot. Some of the characters, such as Davos, were so boring that I almost skipped their chapters. The past books have been so good, this left me numb.",0
"There is a somewhat humorous analogy hidden somewhere in the sea of black letters about a constipated fat man trying to take a sh!t.  That pretty much sums up this book.  Actually, Martin's sea of letters is much like the Dothraki sea....it is a huge expanse of repetitive scenery in which nothing much of significance happens.As a caveat, I loved the 1st 3 books.  I also love the world Martin has created and do not mind his verbosity in describing characters and settings in detail.  I also do not mind the violence, sex, or fickleness of the world he has created.  However, Martin's fundamental problem with AFFC and ADOD is that he does not move the plot forward.  He introduces so many new characters that I have an easier time keeping track of the elves names in the Similarion.  I understand he is expanding the universe and building up the ""eastern/southern"" culture.  But so many of his characters are pointless.  And by pointless, I mean that they are introduced only to die or disappear after having contributed nothing to the plot or storyline.  Also, Martin feels the need to create an intricate backstory for every character--which would be fine if they did something important.  Why do I, as a reader, need to slog through 5 pages of filler backstory for a charter who makes only minor appearances?Additionally, why oh why does he insist upon giving us a morass of characters with similar sounding unpronounceable names?  There is another scene in the book where one of the characters complains that all of the names sound alike and he cannot distinguish one from the next.....that would be pretty funny except for the fact that it is the very same experience I had reading the book.  Martin has an infatuation with arkks zzzts dizarss razakss that all blend together.  If you are going to give a character a wierd name, at least make the character interesting.  I had to constantly look up people's names because the names were so unpronounceable and characters so forgettable!  And then in the middle of the arkks zzzts dizarss razakss, there is a shavepate.  When i read that I said WTF is a shavepate? and again needed to turn to the internet.Another example of Martin's inability to move along the plot is the storyline of Tyrion in this book.  I completely understand what Martin is doing with Tyrion's character, but he just takes so long to do it.  I mean, the whole river story plot-line was utterly pointless.  Martin could have just had Tyrion get kidnapped on his way to Pentos and wind up in Merreen with half the pages.  Don't get me wrong, I LIKED the river storyline.....but it didn't get us anywhere. To make another LOTR comparison, it would be like following Sam and Frodo all the way to Mount Doom only to have Frodo decide that the whole ring-quest thing is rather silly, and he'd rather throw in with the elves leaving Middle-Earth.Also, Martin's knack for bringing dead characters back to life hurts the story and diminishes the world he has created.  I liked the fact that no main character was safe.  But if they are all going to come back to life anyways....what's the point in them dying to begin with?  Then, to make matters worse, he doesn't even use the potential of these undead characters.  Catlin Stark as an angry p!ssed off ghost hell-bent on killing all the Freys would have made for interesting reading.  Unfortunately, there is none of that in this book.  There is another character whom we presumed was dead that makes an appearance, but all he does is float down a river.Then, there is Martin's equal knack for sucking the life out of characters that we loved.  Tyrion becomes little more than a drunken  court jester who constantly asks where whores go.  No cunning; no real witticisms; no plotting.  Tyrion just does as he's told and makes an a$$ out of himself.  Dany goes from a powerful intriguing character to a whinny teenager obsessed with screwing bad boys.  The Dragons go from being the ultimate chess piece, to little more than pets locked in a cage...that escape.  Bran turns into a tree....literally.  Jon turns down the opportunity to reclaim his rightful place as a Stark and instead decides to count sausages and wildings and does everything possible to pi$$ people off around him.  So much wasted potential.  Barristan the Bold is now Barristan the Old.  Within 2 books, Martin has managed to suck all the life out of all my favorite characters.  I did enjoy the Arya story/assassin training, but it was done in such a way that it had nothing to do with the plot of the main story.  Stannis does nothing but stand in snow and grit his teeth.  The Red Woman stares into fires and prays a lot.  Cercie gets her comeuppance, but in a fashion that is entirely bereft of poetic justice.  And then SURPRISE!  Someone else we thought was dead is back again!  Someone gie me an Arrrrgggkra!At this point, I don't know if I even care how this thing comes out.  And now, I read it that he intends to write EIGHT--not seven books to finish this story.The most frustrating part of it all is that he has done such a good job of setting up the finale, it should not take so long to get there.  In order to finish this off, he needs the following to occur: 1) The Others need to attack; 2) Dany needs to invade Westeros; 3) Ayra needs to finish her assassin training and return to Westeros on a mission that tears her soul up (i.e., she needs to be sent to kill Sansa or someone she cares about); 4) Samwell needs to get back to the wall and finish his transformation from coward to unlikely hero; 5) Cercie needs to die a painful horrible death; 6) The dragons/Bran/Samwell kill all the Others; 7) Tyrion marries his dwarf girl; and 8) I don't even care who gets the iron throne at this point.Despite all this, yes, I will pony up the dough to read the next offering in this adrift series with the small hope it gets back on course.",0
"Spoiler alert.Pros:Cersei's walk.  Stone people on river.  Warging in the beginning of the book with promise of Others.  Take down of some of the Freys.  Lord Manderly, now that's what I read these books, for.  What an interesting guy in such a horrible good way.Cons:No one gets anywhere, everybody is in mid journey to get somewhere. Not enough of the dragons, poor dragons.  Dany becomes wimpy, boring, and is in love with a boor.Bran turns into a tree, but for what reason?  No Jaimie, or explanation of why Brienne shows up.Tyrion has a lot to do with traveling with another little person, but nothing comes of it.  Jon fights with everybody and does nothing but get stabbed in between organizing foodstuffs, and talking to lots of people.And lots more.  Too many people get killed off, only to come back.  Arya continues to get used to killing people.  Same stuff.  Sansa and Littlefinger - not much happening, either.Seemed to be full of fillers of Dorne descriptions and the new Ageon.  Meerenese country and people so boring.  Lots of descriptions of food and traveling and eliminating wastes from the body. Some violent and disgusting sex, which seem like degrading s&m.;  In great detail.  For no good reason to further the plot or show character development.Someone should edit this man. Dance and Feast could have been one short volume, and something might happen in Winds.  If it ever does get written.Don't buy this.  Just get it from the library and skim.",0
My first and continuing impression is that Anthony Powell wants to be Charles Dickens with barely a modicum of either his talent or his insight. Not the best use of one's reading time.,0
"I was really exicted that Robin Hobb had a new series out following the really good ""Assassin"" trilogy.But this was just plain bad.  Whiny, uninspired characters that ruined what could have been a good book.If you must read the series, do so at your own risk.",0
"I have read books two through five and without a doubt this book is the worst of the series.Dany T. become a confused teenage girl after leading successful victories in ""A Storm of Swords"" it is like her character regressed. Again, though I don't think Martin understands women, like many male authors when writing to develop a female character in depth he fails.Tyrion actually is subdued and boring through out the entire book. The active and wise character of the first three books become very boring in this book, but toward the end you can see the old Tyrion working to become a player in ""The Game of Thrones.""Jon Snow actually becomes so interesting, I actually went back and read his parts I skipped over in ""Clash of Kings"" and ""Stomr of Swords"" very good in fact the best part of the book. Yes we all are wondering what will become of him, but if I know Martin when one hero falls, another rises.I am anxiously awaiting what happens with Jaime, Brienne, Arya, Victorian Greyjoy, and Queen Cersei.  I think after the Epilogue which by far is the best and most amazing part of the book, all chaos is going to break loose in the very said but very cathartic ""Winds of Winter.""Overall the book lacks any good flow, it seems chalky and it is his worst written book of the series. The language isn't there the beauty of the first four books isn't there and I doubt he finishes this series. I think his passion may be gone for it, and he doesn't seem to be the type to finish just to finish  .  we shall never know what became of Westeros . .  we can only imagine and that to me is the greatness of Martin.",0
"I have read many reviews that agree with my feelings of what is wrong with this book and state them very well.  I will not go into too much detail, but the flaws are lack of editing, lack of story progression, too many cliffhangers, and too many characters. Every character almost seems to be traveling slowly somewhere but they never arrive.The book had some good stuff hidden in the dreck. Particularly the Theon/Reek stuff was not bad.  I almost gave it two stars but really feel the book along with book 4 really drags a good series down. Also, the violence level was amped way up (in a series already known for its violence) and it felt gratuitous rather than adding to the story. Overall it felt like the events in this book could have been summed up in one prologue chapter at the start of the next novel and would have been more satisfying of a read.  Hope the next book is better. Will probably read it since I like the show and have read this far., but won't rush to get it.",0
"I would suggest skipping this book and just reading the cliff notes in preparation for the next.  Martin seems to need to tread water for a few hundred pages.  The books are beginning to read more like a history than a story.  Though I understand that Martin wishes to stress the uniqueness of the surprise and the minutia of everyday life, the two combine in this book to make reading a completely unrewarding experience.  It is either painstakingly describing a meal or sitting bored in a throne room or killing off characters by the handful.  It lacks the subtle balance of building and relieving tension.  It's just left to simmer.After awhile I stopped caring so much about the characters and the book became easier to read.  I felt unrewarded for my investments in characters or plot twists.There were also some odd mistakes.  For instance children only hungry for a few days were described with distended stomachs, while this actually occurs after malnutrition covering months or years.  Also in one paragraph a character is described with her hair up and the next it is falling around her shoulders.  I stopped keeping track after a dozen.I can't help but suspect this was a rush job and needed more tender loving care from an editor.",0
"1/3 of the way into the book I realized that the story was going nowhere, and Martin just keeps throwing one-dimensional characters into the mix to flesh out pages.  A MAJOR disappointment, I wouldn't bother buying it.",0
"After all the hype about this book, I finally gave in to reading a borrowed copy. I wanted to like it, truly I did.  I made it to page 164 with some effort.  The characters were not developed well enough for me to like them.  Also, I work with elderly people and the narrator as an elderly man was not altogether believable.What I did enjoy was learning a bit about the circus business  back in the 30s.Please if you know of some real 5-star novels, non-romance, let me know.",0
"This book was highly recommended to me by women in an assisted living facility where I teach, for whom one of the book themes--aging and loss of autonomy--resonated deeply. I found it an engaging read, though the story almost caves in under the weight of the author's research. The characters are archetypes I had the feeling I'd seen somewhere before, lacking complexity, and it was ultimately difficult to care about any of them. The shifts back and forth in time were distracting and superfluous. I felt manipulated by the fantastically sentimental ending, but still, it made me smile.",0
"I am a science fiction reader, and have some understanding of the tenets and motifs of the genre; however, I found the novel far too wordy. I found myself skipping page after page of mainly political jargon and author-speak that got in the way of what could, potentially be, a good yarn.I understand that the new Martians had a dream of creating some sort of utopia that would leave behind all the problems the Terrans were trying to overcome: wars, starvation, pestilence and a host of other earthly problems; but as more and more factions joined the first hundred, they brought with them their own inherited issues and dogmas. So the dreams of the first hundred are, at the end, just an illusion.Don't get me wrong, Kim Stanley Robinson is a superb writer, and when he occasionally lets the story unfold, it is good reading; until we get to the next block of unneccesary verbosity, then I find myself flicking through page after page of twaddle. I hope the next book in the series is more readable.",0
"I was really looking forward to this book, wow was I disappointed.  Absolutely nothing was accomplished and the story remained stalled.  At this pace the rest of the story will fill another 5 books.....at least.",0
"Apologists for the sadism that pervades this series say that its purpose is to upend the myth of the courtly ideal, showing us the vicious collateral consequences for the silent majority of unceasing wars for power.  If this were actually the author's goal, one would expect the silent majority to play more than a bit role in this morality tale: there might be some tears shed, for example, for the two miller's sons whose heads are chopped off as a ruse to substitute for the two aristocratic children, Bran and Rickon.  But no: those nameless children are only archetypes, not real people with whom we might empathize.  Running counter to the apologists is the author's underlying reactionary idea that there is something special and unique about the ""blood of kings.""  Some genetic difference between kings and lords on the one hand and the peasants on the other cause the entire population (other than the wildlings) as well as the author to obsess about legitimacy and bloodlines.  The fact that this is ""real"" in the author's mind is evident from the fact that Daenerys, with the ""blood of the dragon"" running in her princess veins, is the only one who can hatch and tame dragons; and the Stark children, with the ""blood of the First Men"" in their veins, are among the very few who can enter into the minds of other beings and take on their perspectives.  Moreover, it is only a sacrifice from the ""blood of kings"" that can appease the red god and bring forth demons to do his bidding.So, what is the justification for the cannibalism, the voyeurism, the sadistic tortures, the tongues ripped out, the skin flayed, the hands, fingers and toes cut off, the eyes gouged out, the burnings alive, the hangings, the beheadings, the slit throats, the cheeks bit off, and on and on?  I submit that the author gets some frisson of pleasure from these and he knows full well how to play to the baser instincts of his audience.  Why are we allowing this author to play to our worst instincts in this way?  And why aren't we asking why?Beyond the sadism is the clear and pervasive misogyny of the series.  The author is obsessed with whores, and as the series has progressed he seems to have multiplied his references to prostitutes and whorehouses so that there is a reference practically every page in the fifth book.  The author further denigrates women by having even the heroic characters patronizingly refer to any woman as a ""sweetling,"" as if their only purpose is to present themselves as a sweet thing to men, an irritating trope that occurs hundreds of times.  The women characters themselves fall into three stereotyped categories:  the evil, the dumb, and the ones who manage to figure out how to behave like men, and it's only the third category who carry any real interest.This series is obviously immensely popular, but consider whether it is so in part because of an appeal to our worst instincts, and to our most reactionary views about some natural and hereditary aristocracy.  These sorts of ideas, when unquestioned, tend to have an insidious effect on the way we think.  It's especially concerning to see these books showing up again and again on teens' ""favorite series"" lists.",0
"Wow. This book is definitely comprehensive. Wiseman's book on Wilderness Survival is great for people to survive in the wilderness on nothing. This book is written for people in Britain that have never seen civilization. I guess I was looking for a type of survival book to cover how to survive in an urban setting in a major disaster. This book covers everything from ""don't eat moth balls"" to ""don't plant willow trees too close to your house or you might weaken your foundation"". Most of the stuff is ridiculous common sense.The one area I was interested in was Self-Defense. Unfortunately this was just a lot of British Law stuff.Overall the book is pretty comprehensive but more or less ridiculous. You have to be insane to read it cover to cover. And if you're not, you will be by the time you finish it.",0
"The first two chapter were somewhat interesting, but after that it got very bland.  It was like the author was trying to get somewhere, but was killing off all the main character and left you without any sense as to what just happened.  Did I fall asleep and just passed all the intigue and why he was going the way he went.  It left me high and dry without any reason. Very disappointing, after reading the first 4 books that were so great, now this one horrible.",0
"Lady of Hay makes a promising start. Jo is a young journalist who researches past life regression for a magazine article. As research, she undergoes hypnosis and discovers that she is not only easily hypnotized (so easily that later in the book someone calls and hypnotizes her over the phone!) but in a previous life she was Matilda de Braose, a 12th century Welshwoman. How exciting, I said to myself. This could be very fun. Matilda is a real historical figure. I love historical fiction. I would enjoy the puzzle of matching past lives with present characters, and of course I hoped for romance. But alas...it was not to be.The first half of the book was great.  It keeps up a good pace and intriguing events unfold as Jo and her present life alternate with regressions to Matilda's existence.  But by the second half of the book there is no new material and far too much repetition as well inexplicable violence against the main character that simply turned me off to her possible love interests. In the 1st half of the book we learn that 3 men love Jo in both the past and the present and we know who they were in their past lives.  We also learn about the end of Matilda's life very early in the story.  So where can the author take us from here?I hoped that some of the modern day characters besides the 3 men would eventually be revealed to have some involvement in the past lives or a more important role in the present.  However, they don't.  I also expected that that the author might expand on history and offer an explanation for the legend of Matilda building Hay castle in one night.  She doesn't.  And I was disappointed with the mundane theory about rumors that Matilda was a witch.  The explanation: she studied herb lore with her nurse Jeanne and rides horses swiftly, like a man. But perhaps most disappointing of all is the fact that Nick, the man she is in love with in the present was very cruel to her in her past life and not very nice to her in the present and there is no satisfactory explanation of why.  Nor did it seem that his behavior was ever an obstacle to their relationship in the present.  And what about Sam's behavior?  The actions of 2 of Jo's lovers leaves me questioning how much if at all, they really care(d) for her.  Richard was the one nice guy and I was hoping he would somehow turn out to be a hero, but when he turns out to be a junkie I think my hopes for a satisfying finale were extinguished.Maybe the fact that 3 men are supposedly in love with the main character is the romantic attraction of this book.  Or is it Jo's suffering that is intended to be attractive?  Perhaps I was ultimately disappointed because of the promising start, but my advice is to skip this book.",0
"That's a scary title, isn't it? But the similarity to Jordan's endless, meandering story telling is hard to avoid when one reads this book. Like many of the reviewers, I was deeply disappointed in A Dance with Dragons -- it just goes on and on,  little happens to really move the story forward, a number of favorite characters are missing (but after a point, who cares?) and, yes, it was a lo-o-ng wait for this book, which makes everything worse. Poor George Martin, I wonder how he feels after reading these fan reviews, after being heaped with encomia for so many years by just about everyone.  Martin has mentioned recently, in a blog posting, that he was a friend of Jordan -- but he must have been aware of how Jordan totally lost control of his material, he's just too good a writer when he's on his game.  Yet he has fallen into the same trap -- 70% of the material in Dance could have been edited down or out (ok, maybe 50%)-- my main feeling after slogging thru Dance was ""is this it""? A fellow reader, very smart, well-read and well-informed about fantasy/sf, told me he liked it, so, though it didn't change my opinion, made me think I might have a minority view -- uh, no, seems like most readers feel the way I do -- and started writing about it sooner.  These negative Amazon postings were quite an eye-opener when I read them months after Dance was published. So, sigh, what more is there to say?  No doubt it will be years before Martin has a chance to ""redeem"" himself with the publication of a fast-moving, plot-advancing novel -- if only he can. He seems like a nice guy, wish him well, don't think this was a deliberate, make-more-money ploy, but, oi-vey, what a misfire this book was.",0
"As a piece of light beach-reading, this is competent.  But it's also boring and flat, and the characters unbelievable.  It's very hard to locate the conflict for the first half of the book, and the shifts from the mind of a 93-year old to that of 23-year old is gimmicky and not at all convincing.",0
"I wanted to like this book; however, the reality was the writing was sub-par (it reminded me of a a middle or high school essay on what I did over the Summer) and the characters nor the plot were rich enough to hold my attention.",0
"In my opinion, the writing of DwD almost seemed to say, ""These people will take whatever crumbs I toss at them and love it; I am GRRM!""  To which *I* say, ""Look, you ingrate, for YEARS I practically shoved your dang books down the throats of friends, family, and complete strangers.  I defended you whenever anyone complained about the ridiculous length of time between books.  I lauded your Seven Kingdoms in all the different kingdoms to which we traveled.  I started a SoIaF group, that we might discuss this series that we loved.  I spent oodles of cash on your books for myself and as gifts for others.  I supported your website and listened to your interviews.  I convinced people who couldn't stand the fantasy genre to read your words.  I did all of this, and THIS is how you repay me?By writing a book from which you seemed too far away?  By worshiping at the altar of HBO, as your books took a back burner to the series?  By complaining that we who don't LOVE every word written by your royal hand are sock puppets?  By making it seem like your own importance now outweighs the love of your earliest fans?""  Remember us?  We are your earliest fans... the people who read your first book, then your second, etc, and it is we who ultimately helped you to this throne on which you currently sit.Like many other reviewers, I have read the first four books of the ASoIaF series many times over (starting in the late '90's) as I waited for the next book to come out, then the next book, etc.  I happily reread those first three books (again!) as I awaited FfC, re-living each profound event of the series as if I were discovering it for the first time, which speaks to the phenomenal writing of those First Three.When FfC was finally published, I was there first thing in the morning, waiting impatiently to grab the goods, rush home, and then to devour the book with glee!  Then, when I was finished reading...It was okay...  But that was acceptable to me; the next book was BOUND to be better.  It was BOUND to recapture the magic and continue the legacy that GRRM had created.  So, as MORE YEARS went by, I waited impatiently yet again, checking his web page for updates like a maniac, asking everyone at my local bookstore if they'd heard anything yet, participating in online forums to help pass the time.  Until, finally, finally, DwD was released.  Once again I was first in line to get the next book of my beloved series.  I carted it home and immediately began to read.Two months later I was finished.  To be clear: I am a very fast reader, depending on how much I'm enjoying the book that I'm holding.  In other words, I was so disappointed in DwD that it was almost painful to force myself to finish reading it.  I barely recognized many of the characters that I loved, and I kept waiting for the story to progress enough to recapture my attention, but it was as though GRRM was writing from a far off tower constructed from his overabundance of hubris.  I promised myself that I would only write my review after reading it a second time, but my bookmark sits idle somewhere around page 400.  I just can't finish it this time.So, sadly, I not only can't recommend A Dance with Dragons, I also can no longer defend my once-favorite author.  I can only hope that he hears us, and goes on a legitimate quest for the magic of the First Three.",0
"This is one of those books which I felt started off really badly - and so any other brilliance in it was very much marred by the bad start. I found the first part which is a description of an execution rather curious - although it is clearly written to shadow a scene at the end of the book - but Mary Boleyn - the narrator of the story is watching an execution and waiting for Henry to commute the sentence...which she apparently believes he will. I cannot recall a single instance where in the middle of an execution he did this - there may well be but they certainly don't seem to be well documented. So right at the start I was a bit nonplussed.In the very next chapter Mary describes herself as 'the youngest Boleyn girl&quot; who is waiting for her sister Anne to return from France. Now this is patently wrong. Mary was the eldest girl - she went to France first in the retinue of Henry VIII's sister who married the King of France. Anne Boleyn, her younger sister, followed later.  Francois, the king of France even described Mary Boleyn as the most promiscuous woman at the French court - and this was at a time when the French court was highly promiscuous.After that I found myself very much at odds with much of the material in the book - I found it hard to enjoy what was patently a plot device (making Mary the younger sister) to try to build up some kind of rivalry between the two sisters over Henry's affections.There was a great deal that was well written and an interesting interpretation of what very little material there is on the Boleyn life at court (of any of the family) and one of the most memorable instances is when Anne and Mary are talking together and I think it is Anne who points out that they are valueless really except that they are interchangeable by their family who wish to get on at court and thus will throw either one or the other under the eye of the King to try to get preference. There is also a great deal about the rivalry between the Somerset family and the Howard's (Anne and Mary's mother was a Howard) and the changing fortunes of each family as they managed to get their profferred female into Henry's bed.Interesting but disappointing at the same time.",0

"I first started reading this book in 2011 when it first came out. If only Martin would FINISH this series. I am too vested to stop reading and I need the closure.All the books are LONG and they drag on a bit. A Dance with Dragons isn't even book 5. It's really an addendum to book 4. I am a bit lost now since it's been THAT long since I have read the last book. Some of the chapters are a difficult read as I am finding that I use this book to help me go to sleep.I had borrowed this book from my local library back in 2011.  I returned this book to the library after having made it only to page 145. I couldn't NOT put it down (translation: snooze fest). I was forcing myself to get through a chapter a day, but the length of the book and the fact that it was a loaner from the library was too much pressure.UGH the endless details and rambling. Just. get. to. the. point. Lucky for me, I wasn't one of those poor saps that had to wait umpteen years for Martin to release this one as I had read the other books in the past two years.I bought the Amazon Kindle version this year with a goal that I will read a few pages each day and hopefully get through the end.  I shouldn't punish myself this way - I may not ever finish it, but if I am having trouble falling asleep, I know I can just grab this book and be out in about 15 minutes.",0
"Like so many people, I loved the first three books and read them quickly. I could accept that some of the characters that I had identified with were killed because the plot continued to engage me,This last book I struggled with - it seemed to spend all its time journeying to somewhere and did not have enough plot movement to engage me. The descriptions of a characters breakfast, the extent that they can piss, types of turtles can be accepted once but not repeatedly - I kept thinking that I had read all this before and so started skipping pages. I put the book down a third of the way through and after a week or two, forced myself to finish but was dissapointed. I had pre-ordered this book, I will not be reading the next.",0
"I have never been so disappointed and angery, after reading this entire series,  as when I was served up this crappy ending. The author has cheated his readers.",0
"Wow!  This was painful to listen to.  Roy Dotrice may have a wonderful speaking voice but his reading of Martin's work was excruciating to endure.I've no idea where or why he got the idea that all of Martin's characters were either Scotish Highlanders or Cockney Louts - with the occasional poorly done Sydney Greenstreet imitation thrown in for good measure - but that's about all that populate his rendering.  As if that didn't rankle enough, the man vocalized _all_ the women - and I do mean _all_ the women - as 14th century Irish tavern wenches.  Even if they weren't smallfolk in the tale.Had this been my first exposure to what Martin created then I'd have gone no further with it and stayed away from the rest in disgust.You would think that as successful as Martin has been with this series that they would've gotten a more capable and fitting reader for his works.I hope they do so in the future as Dotrice is really an awful choice here.",0
"This book has been a huge disappointment.  I keep reading it hoping a real story will develop.  Yes, the science of terraforming Mars is intriguing, but all too simplistic in Robinson's account.  The characters are paper thin and for the most part ANNOYING.  The only real character is conveniently disposed of just as an actual plot was developing.  The only reason I will finish this is is out of a hope that Frank, Maya, Hiroko and the rest of the annoying lot will somehow meet a cruel and painful death at the hands of Ray Bradbury and Edgar Rice Burroughs at the end.  If you want a classic about Mars, go read Bradbury's &quot;Martian Chronicles.&quot;",0

"No spoilers hereThe books go downhill all the way, so don't expect much of this one. I became a fan with the first and I'm trying to still be a fan, but it's really hard.Expect each chapter to go into details of superfulous things, to be repeatable, and, worst of all, boring. In this last book the author has started to spend a lot of words in useless drama and finishing the chapter when something really happens. Then he skips all the things that happened so you go forward in time to when someone is remembering what happened. Boring and tedious.Another important thing is that the author also goes to the next level in sexual references. And the repetitive use of phrases and words also is tiresome.If you find a book that summirizes this one, get it. This book can be made to two pages per chapter easily.

"I have read a lot of Jean Plaidy's books and this one is definitely the least of my favorites. The story itself has too much repetition and the ending is too abrupt. Plus I was hoping for an epilogue, that explained properly the demise of Queen Katherine and the fate of her children and husband. I had to look up in another source to find all those facts. I will continue to read more of Plaidy's novels, but I'm hoping the rest are better than this one.",0
"A preposterous tale that can only be excused by the fact that it was the author's apprentice work, obviously to Sayers and Christie.  The situation is wholly generic: murder done under cover of `The Murder Game,' and all the suspects have cast-iron alibis.  The murderer's is clever rather than convincing, but even this is undone by the complete absence of clues.  It is not, however, the central murder that damns the novel, but the sheer badness of the extraneous elements.  The facetiousness is embarrassing: Alleyn and Bathgate are at the nadir of their ingenuousness, giggling coyly like a pair of schoolgirls, while the passages with grubby brats are irritating in the extreme.  The final straw is the intrusive and irrelevant ""Russian element,"" which badly dates the tale; indeed, the preposterous bratsvo-torture scenes are reminiscent of Walling and Wallace at their worst.  The previous owner showed his disappointment by scribbling Cyrillics in the margins.",0
"Don't believe the high praise many give this book. The characters are all unappealing and impossible to connect too,  the events are frequently unrealistic,  and the book drags terribly at times.  It certainly isn't all  bad.  Sometimes it seems as if it's about to get positively interesting but  it always manages to get back off track.  The idea:  the first colonist on  Mars deal with idealogical conflicts about how to treat this new frontier  could have made a compelling book.  But in this case, it didn't.",0
"I had to force myself to finish this and was continually disgusted with the animal cruelty. Maybe I should have stuck w/the gut instinct that I don't usually care for historical fiction? Gruen's insight into the minds of the aging is wonderful - she should have written something focusing on that. This book could also have been about 75 pages shorter and was painfully slow at times. The writing was not ""stellar"" - I just don't see all the hype but for the millions that loved it I'm glad for you - just be prepared if you haven't read it to wince w/some of the scenes.",0
"Seriously? For an author who (I thought) usurps Tolkien, this is a really poor work. Lots of moving pieces around and not much action. The thing that really attracted me about Martin's first books was the sense of danger, the overwhelming fear, the classic ""people are too stupid/blind to know when things are about to implode,"" etc. This book was just tiring. Do I recommend you read it? Yes - it's too important and good (still) a series to disregard but wow, this is really making us work. The last one or two better rock or it's going to be an incredible disappointment. Little hint, George - needs to be a little more bloodshed, a little more violence, a little more revenge, a little more tension (I can't believe I'm saying this to Tolkien, er, Martin).",0
"I enjoyed this British mystery, which centers largely around Parliament's House of Lords. That was interesting, since I know nothing at all about how it works or waht they do there. The plot was pretty good too, although the ending didn't really wrap everything up the way I expected and there was no real climax to speak of.My main complaint was the characters. I didn't really like anyone in the book, except perhaps for the policeman assigned to solve the case. The book centers around a woman, &quot;Jack&quot; Troutbeck, who is elevated to a peeress. She immediately jumps into controversy by supporting the traditional English hunt, which animal rights activists are trying to outlaw. She ropes in a reluctant friend to help on her campaign, Robert Amiss. Although he's out of work and in India looking for a new job, he drops everything to come help her out. Soon the action picks up, with a terrorist attack in Parliament and peers dropping like flies.Jack is abrasive and coarse. She's independent enough, and occasionally funny, but not often enough that I could really stand her very long. Amiss comes off as a wimp (he admits it himself several times during the book) and I wondered why he would even stick around since Jack took him for granted during the entire book.I was not impressed at all by the characters and I sure won't be reading another one of these books.",0
"I am a huge fan of The Other Boleyn Girl, which really brought that particular period in British history and the people who populated it to life.  This is the second Gregory book I have read and it was a real letdown.At times, this book is a gripping read.  I found it profoundly chilling the way the characters would casually discuss the slave trade as if they were talking about bales of cotton.  This is when the book is at its very best.  Every time Josiah, Sarah, and Frances would talk business, I could feel myself almost physically recoiling at the very disturbing way in which they talked about slavery.  The beginning of the book was especially strong in this respect and Gregory did a masterful job of capturing the point of view of the average white slave trader of the time.  Their dehumanizing view of the Africans they were forcing into bondage was so profound that they actually believed that they were not dealing with people.  It made me nearly physically ill to think that there actually were people of this mindset, people who could torture and abuse and commit horrific acts against other people and think nothing of it.  It is a chilling period in history.  Unfortunately, the masterful handling of this issue is not enough to save the book.  The one-dimensional stock characters and unbelieveable love story bog the story down and detract from the central theme of the inherent wrongness of the slave trade.Mehuru was a particularly disappointing character for me.  He is more stereotype than human.  His purpose couldn't be more clear had Gregory written him as having the word ""dignity"" tattooed across his forehead.  Yet, in spite of his high principles, he falls madly in love with the woman who owns him, even though there is no apparent reason for it.  A man who loves his country as much as Mehuru does, who despises slavery as much as he does, who is as offended at the dehumanization as he was seems to me to hardly be the type of man to find a woman such as Frances very tempting.  While it does make sense that he would see some similarities between his situation and hers, it doesn't make sense to me that people who come from such different backgrounds and who have such profoundly different experiences in life would find much common ground.  Moreover, Frances does little to nothing to protect Mehuru.As for Frances, she's simply boring.  She is a stock character, plainly put.  Her role is to be the genteel woman left without means who doesn't want to become a burden to her wealthier, titled relatives.  There is much to pity in someone in such a position but Frances does little more than become pale and grave.  Jane Eyre she is not.  Even as she comes to realize how disgusting slavery is and even as she falls in love with Mehuru, she does precious little to voice her convictions.  She is too weak and too mealy-mouthed to appeal as a character and her reasons for falling in love with Mehuru are borderline offensive.  I found it hard to buy the idea that she passionately loved him when it seemed more that she liked the idea of being the one in control rather than being the one controlled.The other thing I found disturbing was the naming of the slaves.  Mehuru and Kbara are the only two given African names.  Frances's giving them Christian names is cast in an offensive light and yet the female slaves are from that point on referred to by their Christian names by the narrator, as are the children.  It seemed like they were being written off, as if because they weren't central to the story it wasn't worth the bother of giving them African names.Lastly, the Coles were a tremendous letdown.  Josiah is there merely to be an obstacle to Frances's love for Mehuru.  Sarah is a character who could have been very interesting and multifaceted had she been handled well.  She has every reason in the world for feeling the anger and resentment she feels but she is relegated to the role of shrew.  In my opinion, she could have been the best character in the book but instead she is rendered so unlikable that even her most legitimate complaints come across as purely annoying.  Had she been portrayed in a more human light, it would have made her attitude toward the slaves all the more chilling.In summary, Gregory's grasp of history is superb and she obviously put a lot of time and effort into her research.  It's a shame that her limp characters detract so severely from that work.",0
"As a small town child,I always loooked forward to the circus coming to town.I thought this book would bring back memories.However,I was greatly disappointed that the author toook what should have been a good family story and infiltrated it with sexual incidents that added nothing to the story.I suppose the author was trying to make the book more ""saleable"" I would not recommend this book,most certainly not to young readers.What a ruination of what good have been a good story",0
"This was all plots and plans and no action. While it might have pictured what life was actually like in the Boleyn/Howard family, there was no action to it -- and I know that ""plots and plans"" can actually make a decent book, because ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" proves it!Thankfully, I didn't buy this book alone (I bought it at the same time I bought ""The Queen's Fool""), or I would've discounted Ms. Gregory as a truly boring author altogether. Hopefully, this book was just a fluke and her others (like ""The Constant Princess"" and ""The Virgin's Lover"") are just as good as ""The Queen's Fool"".",0
"But that is not to say there is nothing good about this book.  The epilogue was simply brilliant and unfortunately the story line got worse from then on.  I bought a book being told that I was going to be reading a courtroom thriller/drama with elements of the supernatural.  To a small extent this is true, however &quot;Lost Girls&quot; is far more about the main character's cocaine addiction than a supernatural tale.  Written in the first person but in an intensely irritating passive tense (&quot;I walk across the street.  Rain splashes on my face&quot; and so on) &quot;Lost Girls&quot; actually becomes very slow reading the more you go on.  Compared with the excellent  epilogue this is a let down indeed.The rest of the time that Crane is not discussing whether to have &quot;one line of snow or two&quot;, we are treated to the other characters in the book.  Most are so stereotypically bland as to be of no interest at all. Thomas Tripp, the accused, is by far and away the most cardinal of character sinners as Pyper tries desperately to portray a horrific fiend of mental imbalance when the effect is somewhat nearer to a sad old man who has simply had enough. Then there is McConnell, the filibustering parent of one of the missing girls and Crane's associates, Pyper's caricatures rather than characterisation of one excessively camp, gay man and one excessively large, unpleasant and rude man.  I doubt very much if Pyper has met the like of either.So in total we are talking about a book initially brilliant which overplods to a totally unsatisfactory ending which takes far, far too many pages to get to.  And that does not even touch on the disappointment of the central supernatural legend that comes straight out of the &quot;Blair Witch Project.&quot;No.  My only advice is do not waste your money and your time.",0
"This novel really did not hold my interest.  It starts out with a number of seemingly unrelated incidents.  The author apparently knows where he is and when he is, but it would be nice if he would share that with his readers.  The novel then proceeds with a bunch of parallel plots, jumping continually from one to another.  That is compounded by the author occasionally telling you how to build a watch when you just wanted to know the time.  Do we really need a manual on building sound suppressors for handguns?The various plots eventually start to come together but, by that time, I was losing interest and skimming over substantial amounts of material trying to get on with the story.  I regret that I followed the advise of the majority of reviewers, who rated it with four and five stars, and purchased the novel.  It is a skimmer rather than a page-turner, and it is not on my listing of recommended novels for other readers.",0
"So, like most here, I'm a big GRRM fan.  We all loved books 1-3.  Feast left us a little... disenchanted.  But we told ourselves, ""hey, no worries.  It's just a buildup to major events in book 5!  Martin is way too good of a writer to put us through that dreadful slump that many epic fantasy series go through once they extend past a trilogy"".  And then we read Dance.  Hachi machi...  Allow me to tantalize you with a few highlights (mild SPOILER alert)- Jon and the Wall:  Gotta love Jon right?  The classic underdog, now assuming his rightful role as a leader and a hero.  He must have a compelling story to tell in this book. Right?  Wrongo.  Consider the Wall.  It's a fantasy writer's dream.  You've got a hoard of mysterious Wildings to work with.  You've got giants.  Skinchangers.  Mammoths, dire wolves, giant boars.  You've got an enigmatic red sorceress now.  Greenseers and three-eyed crows.  Real honest-to-goodness magic!  Dudes who love talking about how big their members are.  And to top it all off, you've got an army of frozen freaking zombies coming!  What does it all add up to?  The most boring location in the book, that's what.  How?  Because not a damn thing happens.  Jon dicks around chapter after chapter, accomplishing in 10 chapters what could've been covered in 2.  Labored reading doesn't begin to cover it.  Worst chapter:  Jon stands around for 15 or so pages and watches 3000 wilding walk past him.  That's it.  Compelling stuff.- Dany: How do you covert one of the most popular characters in the series into one the reader can't stand?  Simple.  Turn her into a whining, simpering girl who can barely decide what clothes to put on in the morning.  Yes, we get that she's still a young girl who is inexperienced (to some extent) with leadership.  But come on... She's commanded a hoard of bloodthirsty barbarian warriors, owns and controls THREE fire breathing dragons, has conquered at least 2 cities, is apparently impervious to fire yet still easy on the eyes, has the blood of ancient royalty running through her veins, and earned the loyalty of thousands of people who barely know her.  I think that gives her enough confidence to not turn into a love stricken teenager for some tool of a mercenary captain, and instead get on with her war.  Worst chapter:  Dany walks through fields and fields of grass, eating berries and getting bit by ants while she thinks.  Her concluding chapter, by the way.  Awesome reading.- Arya's chapters: Unreadable.  I don't care about her training.  It's so damn boring I can't stand it.  Get her the hell out of there and back to Westeros pronto, comprende?- Unnecessary tertiary characters: Enough already.  Focus on the characters you have.  They're good, work with them.  Maybe add one or two.  But I really don't need to read about 10 more random lords or forgotten sons.  Get on with it.- Repeated terminology:  GRRM is somewhat guilty of this throughout the series, but cranks it up a notch in Dance.  Did he get a dictionary of obscure medieval terms and just fall in love with a few?  If I have to read about ""nightsoil"" or ""leal servants"" anymore, I might just declare this book ""as useless as nipples on a breastplate"".  I mean, I know ""words are wind"", and ""if I look behind I'm lost"", but how many words can you rhyme with Reek?  Maybe I'm just being a being a ""butt boy"" here.- And of course, the plodding pace.  Yikes.  I thought Ice and Fire would escape this, but it's falling into the same trap as so many fantasy series - Wheel of Time comes to mind - where the pace slows considerably, more and more characters are added, and you become less enthusiastic with each book.  Even in the worst of Wheel of Time books (and they were freaking bad, don't let anyone fool you), there was always some kind of payoff in the end: a big battle, a major magical undertaking... something.  Here we get... squat.  Maybe it's juvenile to expect some action scenes in the book, and if so then I'm certainly guilty, but damn did this lack the balls of the first 3 books.  Deepwood Motte?  That's the best battle scene you can give me?  Inexcusable.  It hasn't quite reached Jordanian level, where an entire chapter can be consumed with 3 women arguing over dresses and the type of tea to feed a pregnant woman... but it's pretty damn close.To be fair, parts were still interesting.  I kind of liked Reek.  Tyrion is amusing as always.  But when Cersei's chapters are more interesting than Jon or Dany's combined, something has gone awry in Westeros.",0
"...This is not a good book. ...Simply because its not well written, was a least 100 pages too long for the story, contained no characters about which anyone could be reasonably sympathetic and had no focus.Part courtroom drama, part ghost story, the plot of Lost Girls never really finds a focus.  It shifts from a murder trial, in which the main character is the defense attorney, to ghost story to urban legend.  The main character himself is sleazy, unlikable and incompetent and I gave up on finding anything redeeming about him after the first 50 pages.  That said, its difficult to care what happens to him.  The ""lady in the lake"" legend is an element that never pans out for Pyper and shouldn't have made it past the editor.  It merely adds static to an already precarious plot.Overall, its obvious that this was a first novel and it makes a good case for the use of editors.  Sentence fragments and passive voice abound.  If the story itself was better, it would be easier to forgive these things but, alas, its not.Leave it sitting on the shelf.  There are better things to read out there.",0

What a disappointment - frankly it was a grind to read and several times I almost gave up.He is doubtless a great writer with impressive prose and active imagination. However ...I found the story thread impossible to follow as it is disjoint.There are endless introspections and flash backs that add little to the story.He must have used the word 'jape' and 'mummer' a hundred times and I found it irritating.There are far too many secondary characters that left me confused, and muddied the story line.The book is far too long for what it has to say.A pity.",0

"I read this book years ago, must have been not long after it first came out.  I remembered really liking it and looked forward to re-reading it.  What a difference on the second reading!  The male/female relationships are so dated. The violence and abuse against Jo are horrible, and her taking it and going back to her rapist over and over are appalling.  The characterizatons are two dimensional, and the writing is melodramatic and ridiculous.  I'm quite frankly ashamed of my younger self for liking it so much.  There are much better ""past life"" novels out there; "" The Winter Sea"" by Susanna Kearsley is one that I recently read and thought quite good. I would stay away from this one.",0
"found parts tedious and skipped hundreds of pages, but read the beginning and though skipped many pages, read through to where Pam is murdered and the hero is released from hospital; then read abit after that, then skipped to the end. what I like about it is it tells the story of a young sex slave who temporarily escapes her slavers, finds refuge and hope, only to be murdered by them in the end. I like that the story tells a believable fictionalized account of what happens to so many young people forced into prostitution and describes the hell of their life, detailing how they are victimized and controlled. to me, the hero is dumb and his character inconsistently written. dumb because the young woman tells him what she's been through and where, but he drives to that part of town anyway, confident he can protect himself and her, not asking himself what could happen if he were unable to handle the situation, though he knows nothing about the drug world or how it operates. I found his over confidence annoying, especially considering the slave pays with her life. I thought his character inconsistently written because the author writes how careful and cautious a sailor he is, then has him cockily cruise a drug infested neighborhood, which leads to the heroine's torture and murder. 2 and 1/2 stars for the believable story of the slave.",0
"I had heard this was a good book.  I was misinformed.  This was the most crude, foul book I have ever attempted to read.  Though the main story was mildly interesting, the all too frequent use of profanity and descriptions of intimate relations put me off entirely.  I started trying to use white out to cover the offensive items.  I quickly realized that would include a great deal of the book.  I decided I didn't want to fill my mind with such things and stopped reading.  This book went directly into the recycle bin rather than being donated to a thrift store.  I didn't want another unwitting person to go through the same experience I did.",0
"The first 3 books were great, the 4 th and especially this last book is a dissapointment. Martin throws in new characters and new story lines at fast pace and these new characters and storylines are just not interesting. I have read all great fantasy writers but never had the feeling before that i want to skip chapters because nothing important happens in them anyway. Even the main characters are less interesting in this last book as the storyline is always the same: character x sets out to y, but oh something happens so x does not succeed in y so x is doing z and oh, someting happens ..... Etc. The inpredictability becomes predictable, almost no character in the book succeeds at a goal set out. All in all: too many characters, too many storylines that are not interesting, too little develpment of the main story. Editors have been sleeping...",0
"Although the story is quite intriguing and the juxtaposition of Jacob's life in a nursing home with his life as a young vet at the circus is a clever way to tell the story, the hardships that the animals endure are quite upsetting. I had to stop reading this book when August decided to take his anger out on Rosie, the elephant, because his wife who had never ridden an elephant was injured during Rosie's first performance, a performance for which neither one had trained. Circus trainer's used a bull hook to cause pain to the elephant so that it would do what they wanted it to do - I don't know the extent to which he tortured the elephant with the bull hook but I didn't want to find out.In terms of the writing style it is not the best. I believe the books' popularity may have more to do with the scenes in the nursing home which are much better written than those of the circus and touch the lives of many of us who have had to put our parents in or have visited these institutions.",0

"Oy!  I started my Clancy reading with October and can't remember all the ones I've read at this point.  The last one I read was Cardinal and it was really spectacular.  THIS ONE?  Not so much.  Pretty much what others have said.  It's REALLY long.  There's lots of plot elements that just don't belong.  And the right wing political preaching just doesn't fit with the genre.  Sure.....lots of Clancy's plot scenarios are just so far fetched that the sheer impossibility is fun to contemplate and I think that for me that's what keeps me turning the pages.  I would disagree with some of the negative reviews about the battle scenes at the end of the book.  Sure....there's lots of jingoism in here but the general battle strategery that he goes through was interesting to me.You can watch Clancy interviews with people like Charlie Rose on the internet and it doesn't take long to see that this is one weird fella.  He is a smug know-it-all (and I think he really doesn't know what he claims) and this particular book seems to be the culmination of his personality bleeding over into the story to it's (the story, that is) detriment.  At least I didn't pay for it.....I traded a couple of other paperbacks in.",0

"When George started killing characters that I loved, I bit the bullet and plowed on, thinking that it would be all right in the end, that some of them would prevail and ""win"" if you will, but it seems as if he knows no other plot twist than to kill off many of the characters and then maybe bring them back with the ""magic"" we were told was not that prevalent in this world. Martin has ""lost the plot"", quite literally.  He has lost control of his characters and the narrative and knows no way to contritely wrap up a storyline. The story goes nowhere in book five and a character that I have been rooting for since book one may have been killed off, making all of his efforts wasted, if this is so, it is a disgrace, but even more so if he is brought back by some mystical rite. I have lost all faith in this series, add another one-star to the pile.",0

That's all this novel is fit for.  Mary Boleyn is the most bovine ""heroine"" I've ever encountered, and Philippa Gregory's writing never gets above the Weepie of the Week level.  The Boleyns are a fascinating subject for fiction; they aren't served well or made interesting by Gregory's book...",0
"Water for Elephants presents the memories of a 90-something circus veterinarian about the events leading up to his marriage to a star of the show. The novel's language flows beautifully from start to finish, making it an easy vacation read. Circus industry vernacular sets the story persuasively, though other reviewers have noted implausibilities. Determined fault finders could ponder why the author downplays the relationships of circuses with the locals, railroading lore, and depression era culture. But at some point these details would get in the way of telling a good story.While the ending is touching, the climax proceeds from one wrong note to another. The protagonist woos a married woman, uses her husband's outrage for justification, and undertakes an attack too far out of character. Most of the protagonist's friends are conveniently written off as the author describes 'redlighting' (health care we can all afford without the dad-burn gummint) where sick people and their friends are thrown under the train in the dark. The antagonists are killed off the next day, in even more unlikely ""Acts of God"" executed and covered up by various animals. The speed at which the plot moves here may carry a movie viewer, but I found myself thinking ""I can't put this down right now, not because it's great, but because there won't be a plausible place for me to pick it up again.""Memories are notoriously convenient, self serving, or over dramatizing. So others might give this book more stars for its portrayal of the geriatric mind. Killing off most of the actors resolves the plot within the time constraints of TV or movies, at the cost of satisfying character development. Those who write from outlines will feel cheated that the author didn't plan ahead.Injustice distresses casual readers. Extreme events in near-immediate retribution for evil motives will jar readers who seek plausibility. Unpunished sins of the protagonist claw at the human desire for balance. But the fast transition back to faded memories of the next few years does imitate an older person's memories. So when the book reaches its touchingly implausible conclusion, lots of readers may finish feeling satisfied.",0
DON'T read this book if you're a sensitive soul with a love for animals. You'll likely find it very depressing.,0
"I've been waiting for the release of A Dance With Dragons for six years. It would be hard for anything short of brilliance to live up to expectations after such a long wait, yet ADWD still manages to disappoint.I believe the fundamental problem here is the same one that the late Robert Jordan ran into at around the seventh book point of his epic The Wheel of Time. Put simply, the thought and care that the author puts into world-building comes at the expense of plot development. And such attention to detail becomes extraordinarily draining as the smallest details become magnified and the cast of characters expands and collapses under its own weight. I appreciate the clearly extensive research that GRRM has put into all the different aspects of medieval life, whether it be the clothing or the castles or the ships and so on. I just wish he would get on with the story.To give a concrete example: I consider myself to be a diehard ASOIAF fan but I still have trouble making the distinction between Yunkai, Astapor, Meereen and the other locales in Essos. I simply can't bring myself to care about the characters that inhabit the region either. Unfortunately, much of ADWD is devoted to the exploits of characters bearing names like Hizdahr, Shakhaz, and Yezzan who are not interesting or sympathetic. In my opinion, one of the most compelling aspects of ASOIAF is the dynamic of rival houses with histories stretching back thousands of years, each family tied to a geographical region/landmark and the sigil of some creature with whom they are closely associated. None of this comes into play in the eastern continent, where the storylines focus primarily on the tension between slavers and those opposed to it (something I feel is well-trod ground in other literature). Reading about anonymous men described as wearing the masks of a lion, locust and wolf is not very interesting compared to the ancient enmity between House Stark and House Bolton.GRRM does make some strides when it comes to working in the literary medium. I'm referring mainly to his usage of the POV chapter headings as an indication of a character's state of mind and self-perception. This is especially effective when it comes to the story of Theon Greyjoy. I would go so far to say that ADWD can be read as a self-contained story of his character's development set against the backdrop of larger events taking place in Westeros. In light of this improvement, it is disappointing that primary POV triumvirate of Jon, Daenerys and Tyrion are so flat despite them getting the meat of the book. Jon somehow is portrayed more more dourly duty-bound than Eddard Stark in AGOT, Daenerys can't seem to go anywhere while Tyrion is mobile but never ends up in the right (i.e. more interesting for the reader) place.ADWD is obviously a must-read for those who have been invested in the series from the very beginning, but be forewarned that you will probably leave this Dance feeling hollow and unsatisfied. On the bright side, the bar has been set fairly low for The Winds of Winter which we can all hope will offer more significant plot developments.",0
"I'll be quick about this.  Is it a fun read?  In some ways, yes.  On a page-by-page basis, Martin is as good an author as you're likely to ever find in this genre.HOWEVER.  Books, and this may be even more true for long serial stories, need a cohesive structure that allows the storyline to develop, to grow, and then to eventually reach climax and resolution.  It's very similar to music composition.  Readers can only absorb so many plot threads and deepening complexities and left turns into new sub-plots before the work becomes a tiresome mess.  Martin has crossed that line.He may be able to salvage this series, but it will mean getting back on track and starting to bring the critical plot threads together into some semblance of a cohesive story arc that builds momentum towards a finish.  And it doesn't matter to me how many books that takes.  But this reader will not be purchasing another in this series without some assurance that Martin is willing and capable of delivering the goods.",0
"....save your money and borrow from the library or a friend.  You will need to renew...and renew...and renew.  It moves THAT slowly.  It's not terrible, just not good.  It is a disappointing step in the series.  I have it on my Nook so if I'm completely bonkers bored or stuck on the subway I may pick it up and plod on.  Or I may do something more interesting like contemplate my shoelaces.",0
"I love This series so much. George R.R. martin is just an amazing writer and I have a great deal of respect for his obvious passion for detail and creation of substantive charterers.That said I was somewhat disappoint by A dance with dragons. After several years of waiting after having left off on several cliff hangers I was hoping that this volume would make the wait so worth it and I was so thrilled to get my copy.Sadly that wasn't the case.without giving away any spoilers, not that there were many to be honest. the book was a slow ambling drag that teased at upcoming moments of excitement and revelation but never actually got to any.It may as well have been a travelogue since all the characters mainly did was tour the scenery and wait around a lot.It's sad cause the others in the series I would have to force myself to put the book down and go to bed. This one actually put me to sleep and I had to force myself to keep plodding through it to the end.around page 500 I stopped expecting the story lines to progress and began to accept this book was not going anywhere. It was like someone took a movies b-roll and used it as filler to make a faux sequel to cash in on a franchise.I'm so disappointed.I don't know if Mr. Martin is just tired of the series and gave up or if he just isn't sure what to do next so he kept typing words until he reached the word count cut off point.I honestly don't know if I have another 5 year wait in me so I think from now on I'll just watch the HBO show and leave off on the books.Anyone know of any good series I can replace this one with? I'm open to suggestions.",0
Don't waste your time.  Stay away.  You will never get back the time you spent reading this book and life is too short.,0
"This novel is a rambling, disjointed and thoroughly annoying depiction of a highly forgettable era in Amercan history.  The characters are flimsy, the plot is circuitous and the endless stories of animal cruelty are downright depressing.  Perhaps the one saving grace is the author's use of Jacob's character as an elderly man who is looking back on his life with hindsight.  I cannot believe there has been such a fuss about this book and that someone was foolish enough to make it into a film.  Now that will be a real flop!  If I ever see this author's name again I will move away from it as quickly as I am able.  This was just a terrible book.",0
"Life's a bitch and then you get old and it's worse and then you die.  That's all you need to know, which is a good thing because this novel has left me too depressed to write any more.",0
"I didn't see the movie and after reading the book, I wonder how it became a movie.I though it was a ver slow read, just didn't capture my interest enough....Not much if a storyline.",0
"The primary purpose of this ""review"" is to voice my deep disappointment; to add another 1-star review to the list. I only wish that I could vote negative stars.Most of the ""plot"" or ""action"" involves new characters (or at least characters who first appeared in novel 3 or later), whom I only vaguely remember, and couldn't care less about. Sure ""old favorites"" (Daenerys, Tyrion, Arya, Jon Snow, and Bran Stark) make welcome, even if brief, appearances but usually muddying the plot line (if there is a plot line) rather than advancing it in any foreseeable direction. Everything of interest (at least to me) which happens in volumes 3 to 5 could be well (and completely) related in 100 pages. Something like 5000 pages into this epic, there is still no ""closure"" to any of the substories---nor at this point is there even hope that there ever will be closure in subsequent volumes.  For example, there are no Lanisters left to ""get even"" with.  Every time a little momentum gets going, the protagonist (invariably one of the few interesting characters) is killed, and the ""viewpoint"" shifts to a different character POV) in a different story line. It's even worse when murdered characters come back to life a thousand pages later (after having been burned to a crisp or beheaded etc.) because they weren't really dead. Is Ned Stark going to be resurrected in volume 6? The ""theme"" of impersonators (for Arya, Sansa, Theon, etc.) is way past moldy. Sure, some ""bad guys"" are killed or humiliated---but there is no feeling of justice having been served. They ""get theirs"", not for the evil they've done, but rather for pointless political reasons. Even when Tyrion kills his father (a sick old man sitting on the toilet), it's just pathetic, not triumphant, not even satisfying. I'm tired of my interest being piqued by interesting new themes or side-stories which are abandoned and never developed. I'm exhausted by the cancerous convolutions and the lack of continuity. I'm particularly annoyed by the frequent feeling that I must have accidentally skipped several chapters---caused by abrupt jumps (leaving gaps) in the main story-lines, which are never filled-in.As far as all that praise for the ""reality"" of the story. Yeh, the series is more like ""real life"" than is traditional fantasy literature. I happen to be a published historian. I research and write ""real life"" stories (history). Despite those (usually) horrible high-school and college courses we all suffered through, well-written history is fascinating because the stories are real.  An appreciation of real history actually has value in living our lives. I read literature, particularly fantasies, as a vacation from reality---to enjoy a simpler (imaginary) world in which things are simple, problems are resolved, and justice prevails. It may not be reality, but it is a form of hope. Reality--yes, read history. Fantasy---yes, read Tolkien and Rawlings.Many reviews extol the lack of magic and fantasy (another way of praising the ""reality"").  One woman approvingly wrote, ""When a character is killed, he stays dead"".  What novel was she reading?  Although I love Rawlings, Tolkien, etc. the fact is, the relatively little magic in ""The Song of Ice and Fire"", is a distraction.  Besides, most of the magic in TSOI&F; is ""scary old icky magic"" (zombies, possession, reanimation of corpses, etc.) not the appealing imaginative magic of Rawlings, Tolkien, etc.  Giants and dragons undoubtedly hook many prospective readers, but so far GRR Martin has little more than mentioned them in passing. TSOI&F; might indeed be better without the little magic that it contains.Yeh, I know, there are already a thousand 1-star reviews and nobody will read this one, nor yours, but that's no reason not to ""vote"". Write your own 1-star review in order to record your own ""vote"".",0
"I've read two other previous books by Hemingway.  Feel free to read those  reviews as well.  In his best piece, Old Man and the Sea, Hemingway  describes a man's courage and conviction in a mini-epic struggle between  and elderly man and the greatest catch of his life (a giant marlin).  In  another book, The Sun also Rises, Hemingway paints a very rich and colorful  portraitt of Spain and Pamplona that I could not sum up in a few sentences.  Both books create a vivid picture almost unequaled in literature.This  book, however, does nothing of the sort.  Excluding a side story that  concerns the massacre of a town of locals, it is repetitive, boring, and  provides little insight.  The majority of this 450 page book takes place in  one cave and provides very little substance.  Personally, no picture was  painted for me, no human character was exposed, and no real lasting meaning  came from this book.I grew tired of the cave, tired of the speculation  about killing the Guerilla leader Pablo, and bored of the lightweight,  unreal romance.  An editor could have spliced away pages 200-400, and the  book would have not missed a beat.If you're a casual reader like myself,  stick with other Hemingway works.",0
"I kept reading because I was hoping it would get better and redeem itself in the end, but it never did.  Rawness and grit do not substitute for depth.  I appreciated the accurate perspective of an elderly person.",0
"This book should have been a lot longer or a lot shorter.  The first 3/4 of the book was devoted to developing the main character, but with her multiple identities, the switch from one to the other was jarring at times.  There was too little background development of how she fit into each identity.  The italicized passages changing the point of view to her internal thoughts tried to smooth over this flaw, but it failed.  If more time had been spent exploring these identities, the book would have been longer, but it would have been smoother.  On the other hand, this plot device could have been discarded entirely for a better, but shorter, read.  Once the book got started, however, the last hundred pages or so were great.",0
"It wasn't worth the (extremely long!) wait.This book makes a lot of promises-but never quite gets around to fulfilling them.I slogged my way through it, but I hope the next one is more like the first ones...and don't take so long to write, either!",0
"The first couple of volumes of this series were truly intriguing.  It was a little off-putting that Martin's proven creativity was a little lacking with the obvious theme for the work being the English Wars of the Roses with a map that looked suspiciously like England (including Hadrian's Wall), two contending families, Stark (York) and Lannister (Lancaster) and knights being called ""ser"" instead of ""sir.""  But he told a rousing good tale anyway.  After investing many hours reading the now five 1,000-page installments, we deserve better than people just going and going from place to place.  I know he's busy doing his HBO mini-series on this subject, but he needs to wrap this baby up before he dies on us.  I'd recommend just skipping this volume and hoping that the next one is the finale.  You won't miss much.  He definitely phoned this one in.",0
I forced myself to finish reading this book.  The story line was a good one just the writer jumped around way to much to follow the story very well.,0
"I wanted to rate this a ""zero."" WHY can't there be a minus stars rating. Totally disappointed. Over-the top melodramatic and predictable, especially since the ending is revealed in the first 5 pages. AWFUL, totally dreadful, prose. WHY, would ANY publisher (other than Harleguin Press) pick this tripe up! Thank god I got this from the library and didn't pay $$$ for this.I suspect this may be one of those rare instances where the film version might be better (but only if they make the orig novel unrecognizable). It certainly couldn't be any worse. I listened to the audio version while exercising and could not reach the fast-forward button--made my workouts twice as difficult. ;-)",0
"I loved Barbara Erskine's Midnight Is A Lonely Place, and House of Echoes. I count them among my favorite books in spite of what I feel are weak, tacked on endings that seem as if the author had simply run out of ideas and thrown up her hands in defeat.The stories themselves were great, suitably spooky and they made a sort of sense...insofar as these things ever do make sense. Ms. Erskine even won my eternal gratitude in that she refrained from overdosing us with ""romance"" just because these stories had female protagonists AND weren't gore splashed ""horror"" novels.In short, now that Barbara Michaels is no longer writing ghost stories I was happy to find Barbara Erskine.Hiding From The Light was, however, a terrible disappointment.Characters who put themselves directly in front of runaway trains and then act shocked that they get run down tend to bore and annoy me...er...that would be Sarah.I KNOW that the story must go on, and that peril must be created for the heroine somehow but poor Ms. Erskine seems to have forgotten that tension is only sustained when the heroine seems to wish to AVOID placing herself in harm's way!The saddest part of it all is that I really enjoyed the ""ghost story"" part of this tale. Had Erskine stuck with the adventures of the ghost hunter T.V. crew, or simply with the attempts to keep the dead Witch Finder General (how's THAT for a job title) under control it might have made more sense.The plotline of the modern day heroine who is being acted on by forces she doesn't even KNOW exist seemed a very good excuse for putting a heroine in danger, and therefore worked in the context of the story without making you wish to slap the poor woman senseless.I won't even go into the ugly lies hurled at Wicca in this book. Holy, moley, I'm a Catholic and I was turned off, especially since I can't for the life of me see how a connection with and a reverence for nature is synonymous with evil, but that is niether here nor there. I fear, however, that in the not too distant future this book will seem as bigotted and wretched as old stories with evil depictions of Jewish or Catholic people seem now.In short, in spite of recognizing Ms. Erskine's undisputed talent for creating a shivvery, ghostly scene, the unlikely and stupid characters made this book difficult for me to enjoy. It's back to re-reading Midnight and House of Echoes for this kid.I really don't like it when cats get killed in my fiction either. No harm to children or cats is a cardinal rule and alas this book broke that rule too.Sigh...I'm hoping Barbara's next effort is more enjoyable.",0
"At some point, Tom Clancy moved from being a great technothriller writer to a strident right-wing journeyman pedestrian page filler.  I think this was the book where that turn became obvious.  While there are excellent technical details and the novel moves at a fairly rapid pace, there are also many strident pages full of racist stereotypes.  Unfortunately Clancy also tries his hand at writing sex scenes and he is embarrassingly bad it.  A disappointment.",0
"There are already a legion of critical reviews of this book out there, but I'll add one more since there seem to be quite a few obviously bogus 5-star ""reviews"" on this site for the purposes of buffing the overall rating.Like many others, I have been a fan of this series for more than ten years, and have been anxiously awaiting ""A Dance With Dragons"", even though ""A Feast For Crows"" was a huge disappointment after the three fantasy masterpieces that opened this series. I told myself that perhaps AFFC was a misstep, and that once ADWD came out all anxieties would be laid to rest because it would be another masterpiece. Wrong. This novel is tedious, meandering, needlessly vulgar, and does not advance the story in any significant way at all. Keep in mind that I have read the first three books three times each, so when I say that this book is a soporific, it is coming from a former admirer of Mr. Martin. Several of the characters that we care about are not in this book at all, but numerous characters and story-lines that seem pointless and distracting are introduced. I find the land of Westeros fascinating, but I don't care enough to follow the life story of every minor noble and haberdasher in it, which the author seems intent upon doing. Even worse, the cruelty described in this book borders on grotesque. It's as though Martin felt the need to ""spice"" up the already brutal, violent, borderline misogynistic legacy of this series in an effort to compensate for the feeble storytelling.I'll stop here. Many others have gone into much more detail as to exactly what went wrong with this book (and the previous one). Personally, I can come up with only one conclusion: George RR Martin doesn't care about this series anymore, or has completely lost control of it. Either way, I'm done with both this series and this author.If this thing wins the Hugo Award, it will be a travesty. I wish it had ended as a trilogy with ""A Storm of Swords"".",0
"While reading the first 4 books in A Song of Ice and Fire Series, I just couldn't put them down. But while reading a Dance With Dragons, I have to make myself read in order to finish the book.The book has too many pointless descriptions of places, clothes and food. There are also too many pointless dialogues and things who could have been told in one chapter, takes 3 or 4. Besides that, something rarely happens.",0
"My book club read and discussed this book a few years ago. All but one of us hated it. I knew then that it was written---or edited---for easy adaptation to film.Ta da!!The overall skeleton of the story is not bad, I just wish that another writer fleshed it out. This is minor literary fiction, at best.",0
"I bought the first book and was immediately hooked; the second book was bait for the third, which left me waiting for a finish...instead I get feast of crows, which asks more questions than it answered.  I love fantasy, I enjoy ongoing series, but I am not buying into another ""Robert Jordan"" and waiting for this guy to die so I can finally figure out the finish.  I suggest the fan base of the initial plot lines get together online and finish it ourselves.",0
"I was excited to read this book, but I was disappointed in it. Maybe I expected too much because of all the hype and the movie coming about a month after I read it.The premise was great- a Cornell educated kid drops out during his exams due the death of his parents, and finds himself transported into the world of a circus train during the Great Depression. The story is told sort of as a flashback, it goes back and forth between Jacob as a ""90 or 93 year old man"" and Jacob as a 23 year-old college dropout. It sets itself up to be touching, moving, etc., and it does take you back to a time that's grand and terrible. But it falls flat. The author could have done so much with Jacob, Marlena and August. The brightest spots of the novel are Jacob in old folks home- we really get to see his character there. Marlena was beautiful but boring, and August was brilliant but crazy. We see several spots where she could have gone deeper with all three characters, bur fails to so so.The author telegraphed the ending a mile away, but that era wasn't about happy endings. That era was about sadness, struggling and being down on your luck.The other bright spots of the novel occur when the author describes Rosie the elephant, and the ins and outs of the circus and how it works. It is clear she did a lot of research on how the circuses worked, and it was nice to be able to picture those details.The book had so much potential. I wish it would have been better.",0
"With an emphasis on the ""fiction"" part! This could've been a really good novel but it fell way short.  I guess I just prefer historical fiction to be well, historical!",0
"I am amazed by Martins' abililty to develope characters that you route for and some of the most dispicable characters ever created in literature. The problem is the use of these characters. The saga continues and more story lines are added to the already over inundated story. Nothing is concluded. I did not feel any closer to resolution after this book than when I began. As I have from the beginning, I feel almost beaten up at points. In conclusion, with the extraordinary length of this novel, I am very disappointed with the result. Unfortunately, It is impossible for me to give up on a series one I start. If you don't have this issue, I don't recommend this book.",0
"This is a best seller and has been lauded by many as an accurate portrayal of circus life in the 1930s.  Perhaps this is true.I loved the narrator, an elderly gentleman who is living in a nursing home.  I related to his upsets about the way he is being treated and understood his desire to get himself to the circus which has pitched its tent across the street from the home.  I felt empathy of this old man and felt the several chapters relating to his present life were done well.Through his voice we learn his story in flashback and most of the book takes place in this circus in the 1920s when the old man was young.  As the fresh-faced new kid, he's a stereotype.  And so is the woman he falls in love with.  Problem is that she's married to the ringmaster.  How this all turns out is mildly interesting, especially the parts about the animals, but I kept hoping the book would get better and I would feel some empathy for someone.Therefore, while this book has a few good moments, I can't even give it a lukewarm recommendation.",0
"I read the first 100 pages and the plot of blowing up a bridge was fine, although the plot is exceedingly slow.  Hemingway does a good job with describing the details of the surroundings.  The main character Robert Jordan will have an observation of another character that is insightful.  Then the old guide Anselmo will have the same observation.  Then the old woman Pilar would have the same observation.  Then the guerrilla guard will have the same observation.  Why is everyone talking about the exact same observation?  It seems pretty bad writing and a poor understanding of human nature for everyone to be echoing Robert Jordan's thoughts.But that amaturish style wasn't what turned me off of the book.  It was the horrible love story.  I'm a woman in my 30s and maybe this kind of tripe would appeal to guys, but the love story was not only exceedingly unrealistic, but also stupid and insulting to women.  I was curious how this horrible love story would end, so then I read the last 20 pages of the book.  The ending of the love story was even worse than the beginning.This book was not only not insightful about human nature, it actually ran counter to human nature.I do like Hemingway's book ""The Sun Also Rises.""  That book is a simple story, but well done.  I recommend that book over For Whom the Bell Tolls.",0
"After making it to the end of book 5, I refuse to waste another dollar or minute of my time on this meandering miasma of meaninglessness.Book 1 was of course a pretty good read. By books 2 and 3, I started reading just one sentence per page in some chapters to get through the endless and excessive descriptions. By books 4 and 5, in many chapters I was reading perhaps one sentence every five or ten pages because the story literally moves that slowly.I really don't know what GRRM hoped to accomplish with the awful books 4 and 5. As countless other reviewers have pointed out, despite their 1,700 pages of text, pretty much nothing happens except that a character or two that might have been developed in some meaningful way was killed off.There is so much that could have been done but wasn't. Sansa and Tyrion could actually have learned something from each other, and their marriage might have developed with a little time. Arya was on a roll for the first three books then hit the tar pits of books 4 and 5. And Jon ... what a waste.My biggest gripe is GRRM's proclivity for doing lengthy character developments, then abruptly killing the character. I found almost as bad his undeviating use of cliffhanger chapter endings. Obviously, it is a pretty standard practice in popular entertainment novels, but he manages to make the trite device excruciatingly painful time after time by waiting five or ten chapters, or even an entire book, to again pick up the story for that character.In short, GRRM has squandered in countless ways what could have been an exciting three or four books.  Instead, he supersized it, filled it with bloat, and destroyed nearly all forward momentum with hundreds and hundreds of pages of meaningless writing.So I'm done. I refuse to read any more.",0
"Dreadful.  Judging from the first paragraph, this novel had the potential for being absorbing and a good holiday read.  I was soon only making my way through it because I had nothing else to read and I kept thinking it must get better since it came highly recommended.  If only I had had something better than this time waster: lazy plot that never seemed to go anywhere because it went in too many irrelevant directions, little firsthand knowledge of the circus, low-level vocabulary.  A waste of time on a good topic.",0
"I was given this book by a friend that insisted that I read it, ""It was fabulous"".  I read about 100 pages of it and set it down which is something I rarely ever do.  A couple months go by and I was at a party where a couple people again said what a great book it was.  I decided I had to give it another try so I picked it back up and continued to read it.  At the end, I still don't understand the love of this book.  I didn't care for the animal brutality and I just never connected with the characters in this book.",0
"While the science discussed in ""Red Mars"" is interesting in and of itself, the author goes on and on about it instead of sprinkling it throughout the text.  The result reads something more like a non-fiction description of how to get to Mars, settle there, design machinery for it, etc., but doesn't present a compelling story.  A compelling story is set up in Part I (Festival Night), which is all of 23 pages, but then Part II (The Voyage Out) rears its ugly, boring head.Part II introduces various characters on their way to Mars and not one of them seems especially intelligent nor highly regarded by his or her peers.  One guy, a Russian, goes around spouting philosophy and calling people names like ""idiot.""  In fact, he would have fit right in with those immature misfits relighting the sun in the movie ""Sunshine.""  After about 80 pages of ""going nowhere,"" I opted to pass on this version of Mars.  I'll also be giving the Green and Blue versions a miss.",0
"This was my second (and will probably be my last) Tom Clancy novel.About 25 years ago, I read PATRIOT GAMES, which I thought was one of the worst bestsellers I'd ever read.  It had a line in it that still makes me cringe after all these years.  Jack Ryan, the Teflon super hero, is chasing down IRA terrorists in a boat helmed by Prince Charles (yes, you read that right, Prince Charles) and after some expert move on the prince's part, Ryan tells him, ""Way to go, Your Highness.""That has become a catch-phrase for me.  When I finish an awful action novel, I say to myself, ""Way to go, Your Highness.""But, hey, Clancy is a very popular writer and maybe I should give him another chance.  I grew up on Ian Fleming's James Bond novels and loved Frederick Forsyth's classics like THE DAY OF THE JACKAL and THE ODESSA FILE.  So I read the 750-page book, WITHOUT REMORSE.There are actually two different stories here.  One is how a former Navy Seal goes after drug dealers in Baltimore.  The other is about the rescue of Vietnam POW's.  Each one would've been enough for a novel--a good one, anyway--but by cramming both into the same story, there is no real threat of danger to the main character.  To make my point, imagine if James Bond was on the heels of Harlem drug dealers and jetting off to pursue diamond smugglers in Las Vegas about halfway through the story.  You just know that nothing is going to hurt this guy.  And Clancy puts plenty of self-satisfied chest-thumping among the generals and soldiers to underscore it.This is probably the first book I've read where a time and place (America in the Vietnam-era 1970s) is so completely ignored.  I can't think of one historical or cultural reference to place this story in the past and I had to keep reminding myself, ""This is supposed to be the 70's.""The villains in Clancy's book are almost laughable.  No, they don't have to sound like GOODFELLAS (although they try here and there), but I noticed that almost all dialogue is clearly from one person.  When the hero takes a cracked-out hooker he's cleaned up by her old haunts, they spot a bad guy and she says, ""That's so-and-so's lieutenant.""  Would a crackhead hooker even know what a lieutenant is?I kept thinking that this was like porn for military minds.  How else would you explain two to three pages describing the breakdown of a handgun?  All the hierarchies and posturing and testosterone banter?But what do I know?  Clancy is so huge that there isn't an editor in the world who can touch his books (although the first 100 pages of this book could easily be cut out--unless you just love boating).  And there is clearly an audience for this.  But that doesn't make it any good.""Way to go, Your Highness.""",0
"Since I only read 50 pages, I'm not sure that it is fair for me to review, but I have read some very long books and enjoyed them.  This book is NOWHERE after 50 pages, and it was painful to even get that far.  Each character is described in excruciating detail - not by actions, but simply by words and their own thoughts.  This really helped me to appreciate authors like Terry Brooks and Terry Goodkind who can describe characters as the story grows, so that something is happening as you read.  After all, it is our actions that define us...",0
"This latest installment does not live up to the previous books.  Although there are some interesting parts, another reviewer got it pretty much on the mark--1000 pages of not much happening.  I have read all of the other books in the series and they are all spectacular, but this book falls completely flat.  Not sure what is going on here, how could there be a difference between this book and the others in the series?  Did GRRM run out of any new ideas for the series and is just now writing just for the money.  Unfortunately, I have seen this before.....writers of epic fantasies sometimes just keep the series going for too long.  It has been a long time since I was this bored reading, not sure I will get the next installment.",0
"The 5th book in this series is as boring and a slog to read as was Book 4. Enough already, just get to the end so I can know who survives and who wins the war. Books 1-3 were well written, and this is NOT a 10 book Harry Potter series. It has taken me to SKIMMING through 70% of the book just to get to find out what is going on with the Character Cercei. The subplot for Tyrion and Jorah was UNNEEDED, UNNECESSARY, and should did not do anything to improve this book. George, PLEASE, if you read these reviews, stop writing already and get to the end.  If you do not mind paying for this book, you could just read the last 4 chapters.  I understand there is a Book 6 coming. At this point, I will wait until the LAST book to buy another one.",0
"I would like to preface this review but stating that I am a huge GRRM fan. A Song of Ice and Fire is one of my favorite reads. That was until this book. I have just now finished the 959 page torment. I bought this book the day it was released and I have now only just finished reading this 4 months later.I will agree with the other reviewers that this book was way to long and said absolutely nothing. What has George done with my Starks? I fell in love with this family, he made me fall in love with this family and now what? NOTHING, that's right NOTHING. I loved the whole direwolf connection and I am still waiting for Arya to come home and kick some A$$. But no, she is still in a temple doing NOTHING. What has happened to the strong women in this story. In this book Dany was weak and whiney and love sick. There were chapters upon chapters of nothingness.I will most likely buy and read the next book when it comes out 5 years from now because I feel like I have invested time from my life I will never get back.Dear George,I need some resolution. I have stuck by you for a very long time now and feel like as with most men you finished the best part way to early. Please don't write another 959 page book about boats and urinating and what people are wearing and dragons who don't do anything. I don't know if I could take that. I will conclude this rant buy saying there are way to many new characters in this story that no one cares about. They do NOTHING but fill paper. Please George get back to the ""meat"" of your world. Stop taking us places no one wants to go. You need to reread the first three books again and rekindle your love of these characters that we, your readers, have come to care about. Also, FIRE your editor.",0
"I wanted to like this book. I really did. I love epic literature and, having recently fallen in love with hard sci-fi, I thought I'd love this, too. After all, it's an epic and it's hard sci-fi. It also won a Nebula award and was nominated for other prestigious awards. How could I possibly go wrong with that? Well, go wrong I did, and here's how:To begin, this book isn't really science fiction. It's like a work of regular fiction crossed with a science textbook about Mars and it doesn't do either very well. Anyone reading this review who hasn't read the book is probably scratching his head trying to figure out what I mean by that, but if you've ever read any other sci-fi, after you read this, you'll know what I'm talking about. The plot moves at a glacial pace and Robinson takes a paragraph to describe what could be adequately described in one sentence. About a third of the way through, when Robinson took a whole paragraph to describe someone screwing in a bolt, I put the book down and haven't picked it up since.I didn't get far enough into the book to get to any of the politics, but I know from reading reviews that the leader of the pro-corporate faction, Phyllis Boyle, was also an intolerant born-again Christian with an abrasive personality who was disliked by everyone else. This is predictably hackneyed, but perhaps not surprising, since out on the left coast where Robinson is from, it's a not uncommon belief that us rubes here in the hinterland spend all of our spare time handling snakes at tent revivals and voting against Democrats because we hate non-whites and gays and would rather be enslaved by Wal-Mart than see any of them get a fair chance in life.Then, there was the head of the Russian contingent, Maya Toitovna. In the real world, such a histrionic floozy as her would never get anywhere near a mission such as this, let alone be put in a major position of authority within it. In fact, most of the characters were so thoroughly annoying that by the time I finally put the book down, I was hoping that some grotesque form of alien life would show up and kill and eat them.All in all, I'm glad I checked this piece of hack trash out from the library and didn't pay any money for it. It's sad that this, along with the other books in the Mars series, have taken the place of the best-known and most extensive work on the colonization and terraforming of Mars, as it's an epic subject and it deserves so much better.If you're new to Sci-Fi and want to wet your feet, avoid this and check out something by Arthur C. Clarke. He's a master of the genre and hisCollected Storieswould be an ideal tome for you to cut your teeth on. Hell, evensomething by Lionel Fanthorpewould be better than this. His writing is at least bad enough to be entertaining and he at least steers clear of politics.",0
"With over 80 detective novels to her credit, not to mention an enormous number of short stories, plays and even romance novels under the pseudonym Mary Westmacott, Agatha Christie is, by any conceivable standard, a prolific author. Therefore, it follows as a logical inevitability that something she wrote must be classed as ""the best"" and something else as ""the worst"". I can't claim to have read everything the good lady wrote but, of those novels that I have read, ""Passenger to Frankfurt"" easily qualifies as the worst of the bunch.Stafford Nye, a rather shiftless, easygoing member of Britain's diplomatic corps who, by his own admission, enjoys a good joke and takes life rather less than seriously, encounters a mysterious woman in the airport in Frankfurt. Appealing to his chivalrous instincts and his desire for a bit of an adventure, she persuades him to let her steal his passport and boarding pass and use them to travel to England to avoid what she claims would be her likely murder if she travelled to Switzerland on her previously intended route.Starting from this preposterously unlikely opening scenario, Christie takes us on a pointless, meandering, achingly repetitive ""thriller"" that actually constitutes a personal diatribe - the aging dowager authoress's post 1960s current outlook on the world as she rather bleakly perceived it. Neo-fascism, youth rebellion, drugs, violence, armament smuggling, hippies, skinheads and megalomaniacal financial tycoons bent on world domination all make their appearance in a novel whose plot never truly crystallizes into anything concrete.The current Wikipedia article on ""Passenger to Frankfurt"" quotes Robert Barnard, a crime writer and contemporary of Agatha Christie, who categorized this novel as ""the last of the thrillers, and one that slides from the unlikely to the inconceivable and finally lands up in incomprehensible muddle.""I couldn't agree more. Not recommended.Paul Weiss",0
"...but I just couldn't.  Honestly, it stressed me out.  I wasn't enchanted or transported, just full of anxiety at the turn of every page.  I read a lot of books, and I review very few, but this is a book I really wanted to love and had to force myself to finish.  I was hoping for something more along the lines of ""Carter Beats the Devil"", but instead I got ""The Devil tortures Carter and his girl and Carter ends up alone in a nursing home.""  I just couldn't get behind this story.",0

"This is a fun book, and the Martian landscape and culture really strike  the reader.  I must say I enjoyed the beginning more than the end --  certainly it moved faster.  The characters are interesting and not at all  stereotypical, and the plot is well constructed and compelling.That  said, the science in the book is awful -- hence the 2-star rating.  An SF  novel can't be a quality novel if the science isn't up to the fiction.  I  am not talking about the space travel or terraforming aspects.  I'm talking  about the economics.  It irks me when 'science fiction' has rigorously good  science in the physical sense, but terrible social science.  Would we  endorse well-written science fiction novels which assert that the sun  revolves around the earth?  Of course not.  Then why should we endorse a  novel which claims that 'half the world is starving, and always will' -- a  completely false claim, given the available evidence?  Of course one might  reply that it was not 'the novel' which made such a claim, but instead one  of the characters -- yet it's clear what the reader is intended to think  (hint: when wondering what the author thinks, see which character always  gets the last word).Mr. Robinson plainly knows very little about  population or natural resource economics, but this does not stop his  characters from expounding at length upon the alleged deficiencies of  conventional economic theories.  To be sure, this is not an uncommon malady  -- that is, people 'criticizing' economic theory when the 'critiques' they  have dreamed up were anticipated and answered by economists 100 years ago  -- but that makes it no less irritating.I will probably read Green Mars  nonetheless.  There's one born every minute...",0
"It very well may be that I am not the right demographic for these novels--my 30ish sons turned me on to them originally--however, I am a voracious reader & can whip through these puppies in pretty short order.Not this one.Couldn't BEGIN to make sense of the geography (even with maps), constantly felt obliged to refer to the appendix in the back (which is not easy with a heavy hardback), finally gave up worrying about exactly which character whose name begins with 'A' was in reference...Here's what I *did* like (in general terms, no spoilers): the colorful disparities between the various peoples--Westeros, Ghiscari, Unsullied, etc., the Wall as a character in itself, the underpinnings of religious bigotry evidenced throughout.Problem is, there is nothing in DwD that advances these qualities past the previous books; in fact, DwD seems to take particular delight in an absurd level of...what? I just *don't know*! Wading through page after page with no pay-off. Why and wherefore? Boy, it *sure* is COLD!! Um, yeah.So, I cannot in good faith recommend it. But I do think the TV version will cure 99% of these ills. It's just not a great read.",0
"This was not what I expect when I read an X-Files novel.I never once felt any sense of urgency or concern for the characters in the book.  Scully and Mulder felt like they were actors being played by people trying to mimic what they saw on the show.  The supporting cast of characters was so bland and undeveloped that when one of them would die I would scratch my head and try to remember just who they were.The ""Goblins"" were pretty boring too, not much to them other than they could change the color of the skin and they kept stabbing and killing random people.Also, is it just me or did the author spend waaaay too much time talking about what the characters were wearing and what they were eating?",0
"It took me approximately 8 hours over the course of a week to read this garbage, and in retrospect I can certainly  think of things I would rather have been doing for that 8 hours, like, say, setting my hair on fire or arm-wrestling a 400 lb orangutang.  I reckon those activities would have been more fun and fulfilling.This is a truly bad novel.  Truly bad.  The writing is amateurish, the dramatic tension poorly developed, the dialogue awful and the character development is shallow and one-dimensional.  I could not get over how stilted and poor the writing was.  Our newly orphaned hero, Jacob Jankowski, dropped out of Cornell before his final vet exam, jumped a train containing the Benzini Bros travelling circus, got taken on as the circus vet, instantly fell hopelessly in love with one of the married showgirls despite spending barely any time alone with her, took on a cookie-cutter baddie to boot (boo, hiss!) and survived to live happily ever after to a ripe old age.  So there's the plot outline, which initially showed some promise.  Pity Ms Gruen did very little with it that didn't come across as a below par submission to a Creative Writing 101 Workshop.  Probably one of the worst books I've read this decade.  Under no circumstances read this poor excuse for a novel.  The fact that so many reviewers have given it 5-stars is a mystery on par with the Bermuda Triangle. Is it collective hysteria? I just don't get it.",0
"I own and love my Mexico the Beautiful Cookbook, so I decided to invest, and at 50 dollars it IS an investment, in the Italian edition. I was severely dissapointed in it. The photography is indeed as beautiful as the Mexico book, but the recipes are rather blah. I greatly prefer my books by Marcella Hazzan, especially her Essentials of Classical Italian Cooking.After using Hazzan's books, this one left me cold. I gave it away, and that is rare, as I collect cookbooks. Save your money.",0
"-Juvenile and disney plot.-faulty and unrealistic details.-Uninteresting and underdeveloped characters.-Premature professions of love.Basically, this book reads like a typical Hollywood movie. This is unfortunate, but it is representative of a new class of novelists who are more influenced by movies' depiction of culture, rather than the actual culture itself. Minus all the R-rated stuff, this is nothing more than a whimsical book for adolescents. Once again an underwhelming and lazy manifestation of a great concept.",0
"The Spanish Civil War was surely the most brutal and tragic civil war of the twentieth century. It not only pitted Spaniard against Spaniard, but became a kind of bloody curtain-raiser for World War II, with Nazi Germany and Mussolini's Italy lining up on the side of Franco's insurgents and the USSR backing the embattled left-leaning Republic. (The Western democracies - who might have prevented Spain from going fascist - followed a pusillanimous ""hands off"" policy which only emboldened the insurgents and their supporters.) Into this vortex came many writers and intellectuals. They were to witness brutality, betrayals, great valour, the corruption of ideals, and the consequences of ruthless Realpolitik.So with all that in mind, here's an interesting question. If you were an author trying to write the great Spanish Civil War novel, would you choose to (1) sequester your handful of characters up in the mountains away from the main action; (2) write 500 pages covering a mere three days during which time nobody has anything to do; and (3) make the central character non-Spanish?500 pages about three days of waiting is the book's central problem. It turns the novel into the opposite of an epic. To have taken a canvas as sweeping as the three years of the Spanish Civil War and shrink it down to such a compass-point was an unfathomable decision on the author's part. From this self-inflicted literary ambush there is no escape for Hemingway: you either need excellent descriptive prose or superb psychological insight to carve a good story from such crooked timber, for, after all, what else is left to describe in such a situation save inner musings and the outer landscape?The prose is the next problem. Much has been made of Hemingway's 'deceptively simple' writing style. However, I found it impossible to read ""For Whom the Bells Tolls"" without forming the impression that that his reputation for putatively well-masked complexity is itself the deception. Consider the following extracts [from the Vintage edition]:A hole in a hillside is described as:""both deep and profound""[p. 444]Characters exchange such dialogue as:'Well, then. Oh, then. Oh, then. Oh.'[p. 166]'Maria.''Yes.''Maria.''Yes.''Maria.''Oh, yes. Please.'[p. 272]'But use thy head. Thou hast much head. Use it.'[p. 444]Which brings us to the Hemingway penchant for meaningless repetition:""In an impossible situation you hang on until night to get away. You try to last out until night to get back in. You are all right, maybe, if you can stick it out until dark and then get back in.""[p.  174]""So a woman like that Pilar practically pushed this girl into your sleeping bag and what happens? Yes, what happens? What happens? You tell me what happens, please. That is just what happens. That is exactly what happens.""[p.  175]Followed by some impressive run-on rants as the author becomes completely carried away describing love scenes (How many women - even in the thirties - were seduced by being repeatedly called 'rabbit'?)My favourite passage is when one of the characters reveals to Joaqu&iacute;n that la Pasionara has a son in Russia. Instead of naming the character, Hemingway chooses to write the following clanking line:""'If we insult them a little?' the man who had spoken to Joaqu&iacute;n about la Pasionara's son in Russia asked.""[p. 324]On and on it goes like this. For three days. In a cave. This book has now gone into the umpteenth printing and neither the spelling nor grammar have been corrected (""... the flakes was dropping diagonally ..."" [p. 185]; ""... and then brining it down ..."" [p. 213]; ""... the felling when the Ingl&eacute;s gave the order ..."" [p. 380]; at one point Andr&eacute; Marty is referred to as ""Mary"" [p. 437]).So it needs to be said openly. Hemingway pundits who make excuses for this sort of thing have a lot of explaining to do: otherwise they are obliged to defend similarly poor writing when they find it outside the world of Nobel laureates.",0
"This book has great passages, as other reviewers have pointed out, like Pilar's tale or El  Sordo's last stand, but is otherwise too long. It has three major flaws:1. The hero's love interest, Maria, is a uninteresting and unattractive. Most of the other characters feel like flesh-and-blood, flawed people, but, for reasons I can't fathom, the author gave Maria the psychological depth of a pet.2. The hero's dialogs with Spaniards are in a distracting and ridiculous form, resulting in lines like ""Eatest thou always onions for breakfast?""3. The characters' swearing is clumsily bleeped out, with lines like ""Obscenity thy mother!"" At first, I thought  that the Kindle edition I was reading had been censored, and returned it. I switched to Scribner's 1968 print edition, and found the same. I cannot believe that Hemingway actually wrote that way.Another strange passage that is also dating the book is one where the hero views himself as ""taking part in a crusade,"" adding ""That was the only word for it although it was a word that had been so worn and abused that it no longer gave its true meaning."" And what exactly is the true meaning of ""crusade""? Historians have long known that crusaders were nothing but thugs rampaging through the Middle-East. Even Voltaire wrote about it in the mid 18th century;The Crusades Through Arab Eyes, 23 years ago. Yet Europeans and Americans have, until recently, used the crusades as a symbol of a generous and benevolent undertaking. EvenCrusade in Europereferred to the liberation of Europe as a ""crusade.""",0
"The content of this story left no impression in my memory. All I can remember is, that I did not enjoy it and cannot recall even the theme, let alone the detail, six weeks after reading it.",0
I'm not investing anymore time or money in this series. 5 years between books and the author coughs up this Hairball. George needs to get over himself.,0
"Beware, slight spoilers and slightly more ranting to follow.While absence may have made the hearts of some readers grow fonder, it certainly hasn't for me. A Dance with Dragons suffers from many of the same things as its predecessor, A Feast for Crows. For one, the length. Don't get me wrong. I'm not a lazy reader by any means. A thousand pages is not a daunting thing for me to read, especially if I enjoy the story. But there are just too many words! Martin really needs to learn to get to the point.For example, I could care less about the extensive feast descriptions that pop up, it seems, once per chapter. See, Mr. Martin, I can do it too:""The table was covered end to end with dishes overflowing: lamprey pies slowly congealing in the tepid air, tender roast mutton whose meat looked like to drip off the bone, tail of dog soup, caramelized cranberry steak tartar, blood pudding served with steaming buttered loaves of sour dough bread, Dornish wine glittering in crystal decanters, broiled pig stuffed with dates and walnuts, food, more food, some more of that food we were talking about, did I already mention food? Well here's some more, let me describe it to you in exhaustive detail if you don't believe me...""And five years later we get back to the story, but I've already forgotten what we were talking about. And now I'm hungry. Awesome. I felt like I was reading a medieval Martha Stewart cookbook. I'm sure some would call this overabundance of description ""details,"" but I think it is unnecessary and something that hinders the progression of the plot. If you say that they're having a feast or dinner or whatever, Mr. Martin, I believe you. I promise! Now please use that page space for furthering the plot instead.I don't have all negative things to say about ADwD. I do love the POV characters. Well, okay. Most of them, the ones that actually add to the story. But those one-off, fringe characters that easily could have been shafted from the final draft? Those characters get on my nerves. Why waste a chapter on The Iron Suitor when I could read more of Arya, or Jaime? The POV characters who got significant face time in this book were, thankfully, very interesting, although Tyrion is starting to wear out his welcome. I've always been fond of Bran as a character, so I really looked forward to reading his share of the chapters. I liked that Theon had his chance to shine, and I do love reading about the Wall and the North through Jon's POV.Here's my main problem with the series however. No amount of clever wording, surprisingly exciting (but few and far between) chapter installments, or intriguing character development can mask the fact that not a lot has happened over the course of these five books. I feel like I'm watching one of those television shows where each week they have some exciting, self-contained little adventure that adds absolutely nothing to the overarching plot.Argue with me all you want to the contrary, I'm sticking with that assessment. I've been so blinded by the idea of this being an epic fantasy book series that I've ignored the fact that there has been very little follow-through in that regard. This series has been overhyped. There, I said it. It's still a tremendous body of work, sure, but if Mr. Martin churns out hundreds of pages per installment and can only move the plot along at a snaillike pace, maybe I'm not getting enough bang for my buck, and that disappoints me. I want this story to be worthwhile.And I want to see how this all ends. I do. But it's going to be a wearisome struggle to get there. Is it really worth it?",0
From the very beginning I knew I would not enjoy this book.  I only read a couple of chapters and put it down.,0
"...then read something great like War and Peace.This is worse than a steaming pile of you know what - it is a long steaming pile of you know what.  The smell stays with you long after you've finished it.Like others have said, I loved the first 3 books.  Then, AFFC was terrible.  I didn't know if anything else could be quite as bad, but now this might be even worse.I'm done with the series.  There are a million great books out there waiting to be read.",0
"I though I would never get to the end of this book.  I felt like I was nearing the end and I was only a third of the way through.  There were way too many characters that were completely unnecessary.  Way to much talking and back and forth about the same things over and over and over. (get hypnotized; no its dangerous; no I have to; stay with me; go away blah blah blah).  All these people did was go back and forth between each others houses, argue, and drive to old castles.  After the first third of the book I skimmed and skipped so much but didn't really miss anythign.  I enjoyed the past life part at first, but then even that got a bit depressing.  Nothing good happens in this book.  Oh except for epilogue 2 which seemed tacked on at the last minute and doesn't really fit the rest of the book.The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 was because I did actually want to find out how the story ended so apparently there was something in it that pulled me in in spite of myself.  But I'm certainly not keeping this one around.",0
"WARNING! SPOILER ALERT: The author should spend less time with the hbo series and more time with decent writing. This series started out great. It has become nothing but a mishmash of drivel by book 5.  Too many characters with no substance.. Nothing but pages of mindless meaningless words that drag on but do not advance the storyline.  If the author had stuck to the major characters and expanded upon them instead of killing them all off, the book could have been on the level of Tolkein's work. That comparison has now been lost. What is left to look forward to after the author has killed off Ned Stark, Caitlyn Stark, Joffrey, Robb Stark, Brienne,and a host of others.  Now we're left with Jon Snow stabbed 4 times and no knowledge of his fate at the end of book 5.. Is he dead or not? This is tiresome. The few remaining characters need to 'grow up' in the next book and the Stark children should be returned to Winterfell with the help of Jon Snow to rebuild. It would be perfectly legit for Tommen or some king to release Jon from his vows to the blackwatch so he could stay on as their protector along with perhaps Sam as their Maester and help Gilly raise both 'babe's, or something along those lines.  I'm just weighted down with the total chaos of this series. I keep waiting for the author to understand that we have no reason to have any kind of attachment to the books or characters when we know he's just going to kill them off anyway.. So why bother? Enough of the frivolous killing off good characters. Something good needs to happen and stay happened. lets MAKE SOME PROGRESS! I'm so disgusted with this series that I'm pretty much done with it.. If it remains this stagnant I won't be buying anymore. there was enough good material in these 5 books to have made 2, possibly 3 great books but the inclusion of so much drivel and wasted characters has expanded it to really tiresome reading. Just way too much froth. It's beginning to sound juvenile and in no way written by the same person who started the series. This author is losing his audience to anger and a angry audience won't buy his work anymore. No one wants a constant let down.  Just my humble opinion.",0
"For all the hype this gets I expected much better writing.  I cringed at the fact that the 'hero' of the story never stepped in to help the animal he loved so much when it was savagely beaten by the 'simon legree' type circus overseer.  It is only by the grace of the writer that the elephant didn't strike out at all of the obnoxious people who let the beatings occur!Some of the other reviews say much of what I thought about this book and the writing.  The characters are thin, not lovable, not anyone I root for ... with the one exception of the hero as an old man.  That is better done than any of the rest.The interaction of him with the nurse, Rosemary, is more real than that with Marlena.  I don't recommend this book for those who want good writing.  This is rather amateurish in so many ways.  I do admire that the author did the research... but her execution of the story and the story line leave a lot to be desired.  I felt the writing and plot itself wasn't much above that of a 'bodice ripper'.  I was disappointed.",0
"I was going to give three stars because of the first three books, how could I give this book only two, but when you look at it there is no resolution to anything. a story spun out so that the dragons can grow is about all it comes down to.Throughly disappointing, 900+ pages and no ending to anything. It seems as if George and his editor sold out to Hollywood back in Feast for Crows.I will not be rereading this and it has put me of rereading the first three, hell I may even have to let my friends know how bad it is.George your not getting any younger I suggest a new editor, one that will put you back on track. Let the next book be the finish of it, sell the franchise if you want money, and write something else cause this Game has been played out.",0
Short and sweet - still love the series but it seems like lots of pages that don't move the plot forward.  It is starting to feel more and more like the Wheel of Time series which we all know ground to a halt.  Hopefully Mr. Martin will not die before he completes the series.I first gave this a 3 for its OK but downgraded to a 2 as I realized I didn't like it.,0

"Martin's work has always wallowed in depression and darkness, but his storytelling ability always kept me turning the pages. With ""A Dance of Dragons"" he has finally jumped the shark. Here the story bogs down in a surfeit of obscure names and places and endless minutiae while maintaining the usual level of degradation and perversion. I'm beginning to realize that there won't be a satisfying (let alone ""happy"") ending to this series. Why wade through thousands more pages of this mind-numbing Bataan death march when you know it will simply involve more innocents being raped, tortured, and murdered in nasty ways? Why continue to read about characters you hate after all the characters you might actually care about have been whacked? Sorry, but my masochism has its limits. Life is too short. Screw you George. I'm done.",0
"It took a really long time for me to get into this book, I guess because I never really liked or bonded with the main character. She isn't really a likeable person, neither is her family. The entire first half, I just wanted Anne to be queen so that we could move on from her stalking the king. Then once she was queen, I found that I was more interested in Jane becoming queen. Too bad there isn't a story about her...Over all, an ok story. Maybe I just wasn't in the right mood to read it right now.",0
"I picked this up as perhaps the first in a series of racy reads, but it's author (meaning Fraser not Flashman) is too reticently victorian in attitude. The story is risque and winking rather than ribald. Flashman reports how bad he is, but it's mostly words. He casts himself as a coward, but in fact is the only guy on all the scenes of critical events (even if he fled there). There seems to be some accurate history here (footnotes even), the generals are so quakingly incompetent they must be real, and the epidemic warlordism still rings true. I won't read more Flashman because life is short and this text is so smarmy, racist, and pointlessly offensive.",0
"I loved the first three books in this series. But after a feast for crows, I was about ready to give up. Now, having read a dance with dragons, I do give up. This series could've been wrapped up a few thousand pages and several thousand trees ago. We are now hopping and skipping from character to character without any real advancement of plot. I no longer care what happens to any of these people. There are a few characters I might have still cared about, if anything interesting had ever happened in this book.In other words, if the next book ever comes out, I'm keeping my money and saving my time.",0
"House of Cards is the first book in the Francis Urquhart series by Michael Dobbs. Francis is the Chief Whip.

Mattie is a young reporter with a knack for finding out the real story behind headlines. Mattie stumbles across a web of deceit and financial corruption, risking her life to reveal the truth.House of Cards is a harsh dark tale of the corruption, manipulation and greed in politics, no matter the country. Just look at the book cover. The characters in House of Cards are puppets and Francis holds the strings. His unapologetic ambition is unmatched. His initials are FU for a reason.The author, Michael Dobbs, is a member of the British House of Lords. He is Britain's leading political novelist and is a senior adviser to Prime Ministers. I'd say he is a credible source in knowing the sacrifices made and discipline shown in politics. Perhaps this is why most of the content in the novel went over my head. I struggled through the lingo and Parliament references. I stifled many yawns while reading.The international bestseller is too wordy and politic-y for my taste. But the Netflix original series show inspired by the novel is a must-see! You'll never view Scandal or The White House the same.

I pushed into it, however, hoping for the best. Just could never care at all about the characters. The old guy is grumpy and resentful. Some of the circus behind-the-scenes reporting is interesting, but much of that is pretty low-life and tawdry. Not for me. I will read the ending and report back to my friend, but I will not read the rest of it.",0
This is one of the worse novels I have ever read - The writing is so broken apart it seems that pages must have been pulled out of the book. The author jumps forward and backward and into different scenes and times without any appropriate lead. This writing would have received a failing grade in most college level courses.,0
"A great series has become merely tedious. It's long past time for these story lines to be brought to a close. This book is boring, dreadfully slow and not worth the effort. GRRM can take as long as he likes for the next installment, or better yet, never finish it. The first three books were brilliant, but these last two are a poor finish to what he started.Hopefully, HBO will bring in some fresher, younger blood to wrap up the series, lest all the actors die of old age meandering their way through this ponderous mess.",0
"The book provided lightweight diversion when waiting for busses or when nothing is on the TV, the setting, storyline and characters were cozy in a twee, Olde English way, but the weak writing style really got in the way. The prose is littered with cliches and lazy terminology, including adjectives as 'lovely' and 'ordinary'. These words (unless used in dialogue) is inexcusable in a novel. I could not immerse myself in the story or feel concerned about what what happened next, although I ploughed onwards to the end. I also feel an opportunity had been missed to make Mike Sinclair, the rector more sinister and interesting. He was the best element of the story and held it (albeit a little) together. Sadly, the characters were flat and the story was too long.",0
"I won't wax philosophical and in great detail as to why this was a disappointment; too many others have done it much more eloquently than I could. Not only did I buy the ADwD book, I downloaded the Kindle version so I'd never be without it until I finished it.  Never again.  If GRRM ever does release another installment, I'll come here and get the Cliff Notes and read the reviews before depositing another penny on this series. I thought perhaps AFfC was an abberation and surely this one would make up for it.Let me also add that I'm a very forgiving person for authors regarding timelines for releasing books and the occasional story dragging a bit. When I decide to buy a particular author or series, I buy and collect them all. So for me to give this highly-anticipated book 2 stars and to feel strongly enough to voice my disappointment is a rarity. I'd have given it one star, but I really like the cover and it looks good in my library. Just so.",0

"This was an entertaining book--in fact, I could hardly put it down.  However, as I read, I became increasingly uncomfortable with the historical inaccuracies introduced merely to juice up the plot.  I became annoyed with the devices that appeared with irritating predictability; for example, the horse that just happened to lose a shoe  preventing escape and requiring the characters to remain to the end of the story.  (How inconvenient to lose your narrator to intelligent self-preservation.)  Also I found the occasional feminist twist clumsy and intrusive.  This is not to suggest that noblewomen would have been unaware of the unfairness of gender roles, but I doubt they would have articulated their views to the peasants who happened to till their family's fields.  It injected a kind of revisionist aspect to the story--something I find increasingly annoying in all aspects of today's world.  There were too many obvious contrivances included merely to please or to ""improve"" the story--something I find disrespectful to the reader as well as the characters.  Indeed, if one wants to write fiction, why graft it onto real events and individuals (implying that it is a historical account)?  I have not objected before, when a writer took liberties with history in order to tell a story but in such cases, it was clear that the story only loosely followed a particular time or character.  This story is fiction disguising itself as a historical account.  I don't wish to minimize the fact that this book is very well written and the descriptions are rich and fascinating.  The author is very skillful.  However, I will not read any more of her books.  I felt cheated as if I had gone to an expensive restaurant expecting a meal prepared from scratch and with authentic ingredients, only to receive a supermarket microwaved entry--edible but not creditable.",0
"So you know those books or movies that are so interesting at the beginning and introduce so many complex factors, the whole time you are excited thinking ""how are they going to resolve all these different strands?! This is going to be a great ending!""Well, unfortunately PKD bobbled it this time. An utterly unsatisfying end. I would have regretted reading the book, if not for one delightful paragraph. Let me save you 240 pages:""God is dead,' Nick said. 'They found his carcass in 2019. Floating in space near Alpha.''They found the remains of an organism advanced several thousand times over what we are,' Charley said. 'And evidently could create habitable worlds and populate them with living organisms, derived from itself. But that doesn't prove it was God.""Do not read the book if you are intrigued by this, there is nothing else about it.",0
"I know several people who have read this and loved it.  I just could not get into it.  It is a good story, but that is about it.  I expected a lot more depth to the story based on all of the hype is was receiving.  I was very disappointed in the end.  It is not something I would recommend to others.",0
"Probably the most boring scifi book. A lot of politics, very dull and boring descriptions about Mars ecology. Many text books are more interesting reading than this book.The plot is boring. Characters are dull, annoying, and uninteresting. There is no great character development here folks. Did I mention that the book is extremely boring. Don't waste your time with it unless you are stuck in an airport with nothing else to read, actually just go to sleep, and have some rest instead of reading this book.",0
"I didn't hate it but I am not sure it was worth reading.  The ""past lives"" overstory was fine until it went totally hokey (the rape scene).",0
"I'm so disappointed. I love great fantasy and GRRM is one of my favorite writers, but this is more like reading a text book with nothing but facts.A Dance with Dragons is just not up to Martin's ability.",0
"On the simplest level, all I can say is that it didn't amuse me and I couldn't force myself to finish it. But I'm a ""hard sell"" for fiction, and I can see by the other reviews that many people loved it. Lucky them!On a slightly more analytic level, I'd say that what prevented me from enjoying the book was the ""voice"" of the narrator, who is supposed to be a man in his nineties remembering his youth in the circus. I'm a man approaching seventy, with some circus experiences as a teenager in Iowa and as the father of a circus acrobat in the Cirque de Soleil era. I found the ""voice"" of the narrator unconvincing, extremely unconvincing, as a male of the species and as a male American of the 1930s and 1940s. I couldn't get past that central implausibility. I found myself scoffing at the sensibilities of the pseudo-male narrator at every emotional turn of this quite melodramatic novel.",0
I wish I had just read the reviews and  not bothered with the book. Many of them have somehow managed to compress 1000+ pages into 10 at the most. How is it possible that people have condensed it so much when Martin couldnt?Clearly he needs to fire his editor/s. And maybe try and care about the story just a little.It seems that almost any reviewer here could do a better job than Martins.Maybe someone could write a 200 page condensed version where our fav chacters actually live. But I have had enough of this sh**. Who could even be bothered? Thats all i'm left with now that the anger has faded. Apathy.,0
"This was the longest book I've read in my entire life, literally...... and it felt like it.I had not read any of Tom Clancy's book, though I have seen and enjoyed the Jack Ryan movies. Executive Orders finds Ryan as a reluctant president, after a terrorist act destroyed much of the government. There are many plot threads which Clancy cuts back and forth between throughout the book. Unfortunately, some (like the China sub-plot) are boring, and others (such as the story involving a right-wing militia group) end up being irrelevant to the rest of the book.Many of the early pages are spent on Ryan's words and thoughts about how the government should be run, aka putting forth Clancy's political ideas. The pace does pick up considerably at around page 900, but 899 is a lot of pages to slog through to get to that point! Those like myself who do not have an encyclopedic knowledge of military terms and weaponry will likely find the big climax of the book confusing.With a lot of editing, this book could have been suspenseful. However, it is about 900 pages longer than it needs to be. I am just glad its over!",0
"This book was extremely tiresome to get through.  The military jargon, the number of new characters being introduced all the way up until the end of the book, the subplots, and pointless dialogues and details make this book about twice as long as it should be, and very very slow to trudge through.  The main character, Kelly, is an unlikable fella who kills and tortures people, and somehow, we are supposed to care about him.  I didn't, and I am not reading another novel by this author, and am somewhat surprised that other people enjoyed this piece of trash.Update: I still hate this book, and find it interesting, but mostly sick that people read negative reviews to find something to be pissed off about and then click 'not helpful,' even though they simply disagree.  Disagreeing is not the same as 'not helpful'.  By the way, the terd that wrote the comment will receive as he gave, got that, Josh Boone?  Better stay home, cuz I'm gonna get you, fartface!",0
"While I enjoyed the beginning of the story,I could not get through this book due to the animal abuse (I am an animal lover!) Even though it's a work of fiction I just didn't like that!!! Plus Marlena's character was flat,boring and left a lot to be desired!!! The movie is WAY better! Save yourself the time,and don't bother. This book was made to be WAY more of a big deal then it actually is.",0
"I've been a long time fan of Tom Clancy although Executive Orders was one of the first Clancy books that I've read recently.  I was disappointed with this book partially due to  its overall length.  It seemed that the first 500 pages could easily have been dropped. I literally skimmed 100-150 pages just to get through it. I didn't feel that I was developing a relationship with any character in the book.  Sure, President Jack Ryan was the main guy, but he was still way too distant to really feel that you cared that much for him.  Only in the last 200 pages did the pace and action pick-up.  Save your time for something else.",0
I was a fan of Barbara Erskine but she is getting to be a very self indulgent writer.  I loved her early works but the latest ones are really dragged out and now I feel a bit ripped off. From now on I will wait until they are at the library and not buy them.,0
"Non spoiler general review:I was taught in writing classes that there are 3 elements to any story; the character(s), the plot, and the place. In a short story, you can get away with sacrificing one of the 3, as you don't have time to flesh them all out. That's fine for a short story, but doesn't work in a 900+ page novel, let alone a series. But that's exactly what this book feels like, a criticism I see echoed in other reviews here. This is just a collection of short stories without a binding theme to hold them all together.Song of Ice and Fire has great characters, a lovely world, good writing....and no plot. There isn't even a main character. (Ask three people and you'll get three answers as to who the book is about) The writer's forward states this book is supposed to be taking place simultaneously with the events in A Feast for Crows, but that's just a poor excuse for re-hashing the same crap with no direction. He fills in the gaps with tedious descriptions of women's breasts (the last book it was women's genitals, so I suppose that's an improvement), and casual but pointless violence. 1000 pages, and I think it covered about 24 hours worth of time. At the rate he's going, the HBO series (which is FAR better than the books) will have caught up to him and be delayed while he screws around inventing more minor characters while leaving the main players to hand out in limbo.Spoilers below:Sansa and Littlefinger do not appear anywhere. Bran has two chapters, and now he's a tree. Scratch another Stark off the list. Rickon is awol from the last book and this one. Who knows, are we even caring any longer? Cersei gets two lame chapters, and has been completely destroyed as a believable antagonist. Come to think of it, all the women suffer about 50 points of lost IQ, but at least I know what all their cup sizes and the colors of their nipples are. Jon, previously a candidate for main character, gets stabbed 4 times at the end of the book - IRL or a decent book he'd be a goner, but since Martin magically brought another Targaryen back to life as well as inventing a new subplot involving Varys, I'm not counting him out yet. Arya gets a measly 2-3 chapters. The rest of the book? New minor characters. Like 15 new characters.Do NOT waste your money on this garbage. Check it out from a library like I did.",0
"I didn't finish this book.  I usually love this kind of book.  I got tired of all the Indian Jargon.  Yes, it has a glossary, but many of the words weren't even there.  There were references to things never explained.  It was like I came in on a movie in the middle.  The narrative was just not enough to keep going.",0
"Tom Clancy's strength has been writing the techno-thriller.  The weak points in his books have been characterizations and dialog, especially casual conversation.  All of his characters have been one dimensional,  wooden stereotypes.  Trying to expand more on wooden characters is one of  the reasons his Executive Orders is so bad (one of many reasons).Without  Remorse is a basic action/revenge novel. It is set in the low tech drug  world. It relies much more on character and emotions. Some interest,  dimension, and character development is given to the hero by evolving him  into a revenge machine without remorse.  But, that is the only interesting  aspect of the hero and Clancy ends up cheapening it by later glorifying it  in this book and Executive Orders.  The other characters in the book aren't  very interesting.  Clancy is very awkard with the love stories and emotions  and some of it is just embarrassing.But Clancy isn't the only action  writer that has problems with character development (Ludlum is only mildly  better).  What's really important, is the book exciting?  The ending is  pretty good and there are a few good action sequences in the middle.  But,  there are long boring stretches while Clancy tries in vain to develop the  characters.This book is about the origins of Kelly, the CIA agent who  appears in most of the Jack Ryan books.  I started reading Debt of Honor,  but stopped when I heard about this book.  I switched to Without Remorse  because I thought that there might be important insights in this book that  lead up to the later books.  It turned out that there were no important  revelations here and it really has no impact on the later stories.  For  someone who continues to follow the Jack Ryan series, this book might be a  must read.  But, I may have given up on Clancy after the horrible Executive  Orders and there are many writers who do this type of story better.",0
"... I... Why GRRM? Why? I officially hate this series. Book one was fantastic. It was suspenseful, had good characters, great plot twists, a good (Though extremely flawed) world, and a good storyline. I didn't like book 2, I thought it was boring and drawn out, but it wasn't a bad book, I just didn't like it. Book three is amazing. It's one of the best fantasy books ever, and surpassed by few (Particularly Tolkien). Book four was a piece of garbage. I hate to admit it exists. But could book five be the next A Storm Of Swords? Well, it could've been, but it sure as hell isn't. I can't decide whether or not I hate A Feast For Crows, or A Dance With Dragons more. They are both awful books. I hate to see A Song Of Ice And Fire come to this. Books 1-3 are amazing. But now it's a drawn out, poorly written, piece of crap.",0
I felt this book was just awful and will now stop reading this series.  It offended me that reviewers thought him to be an American Tolkien when his writing and vision are so far from what Tolkien created.  Tolkien created a deep world full of challenges and magic and hope in what is good. Not to mention that his writing was transcendent.Martin creates a brutal world where babies are eaten by wargs and murders are featured as main characters and morality has little meaning.  Who really cares what happens to many of these petty characters and who cares who wins the battle for this world?  Not me any longer.  Horrible and meaningless to me.  Nothing at all to compared with Tolkien.,0
"I had been wanting to read this book for a long time.  I am familiar with the story of Anne Boleyn and Henry VIII, and was looking forward to a masterful retelling by a reknown author.  A friend had read it and raved about it.  Amazon readers are raving about it.  I wish I could rave about it.  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed in this retelling for several reasons.  Firstly, I found the writing style simplistic and unauthentic.  Sometimes it seemed that the characters were speaking in 21st century phrasing.  I found the characters themselves to be unrealistic and underdeveloped.  There was no depth to any of them, such that I really didn't care what happened to any of them.  Anne was a grasping, hysterical, diabolical, selfish user. George appeared to be no better than a hanging-on go-for, interminably lolling around in his sisters' bedchamber.  Henry himself comes off as an easily manipulated, not very smart, spoiled brat. He demonstrates no kingly qualities and is usually either whining to Mary about his lack of an heir, raging at Katherine, or following Anne around like a love-sick, helpless puppy.  Mary, the main character is made out to be a sweet, generous, unwilling pawn of her evil family.  Although she was pushed into her affair with Henry, she really wanted nothing more than the simple life of a country matron surrounded by her beautiful children. She seemed to be completely in love with Henry at one moment, and then totally emotionally indifferent to him the next. Her relationship to her first husband, William, is nonexistent one minute, and loving and devoted the next.  I found it amusing that she could claim complete devotion to Queen Katherine, continue to betray her time and again, and then come sniveling back professing her great love and respect. The only character which I did feel a sympathy for and was protrayed with sensitivity and grace was the character of Katherine. Other major characters in the drama were relegated to minor incidental roles, such as the powerful, brilliant Cardinal Wolsey, the sinister mastermind Thomas Cromwell, and the courageous, honorable Thomas More.  They all became background props for the silly one-dimensional story of Mary Boleyn. The momentous event of Henry's declaring himself head of the English church, and the devastating power struggle that surrounded it is dismissed in one sentence.  On comparing this story to Antionia Fraser's excellent ""The Six Wives of Henry VIII"", one learns that 1) Mary was actually the elder of the two sisters, 2) Mary had led quite a sexually promiscuous life in France before returning to England, even having had an affair with King Francis 3) Henry never acknowledged Mary's son as his.At the end of the book (which I really only skimmed because by this time I couldn't stand it anymore) Mary manages to predictably retire to the country with her lovely family and new husband, whom she's conveniently madly in love with, and live happily ever after while the rest of her family goes down in flames.  Oh well, I guess such high virtue as Mary's provides its own reward.",0
"I simply don't understand the fanfare.  Every bit of this story was heartbreaking.  The animal abuse (especially Rosie), the human abuse (Walter and Camel, especially), and all of the heartbreaking things that happened at the hands of certain men.  What was there to enjoy about this story?  Revenge at the end?  Ok, so I liked the last 3 pages.  But those last 3 pages didn't make up for my sadness throughout the whole of this book.  I wish I hadn't read it.",0
"Like reviewers before me on other books, I would've rated this book at less than one star but Amazon doesn't allow that sooooo, here it is.  I  was tooling along through this book's immediate predecessor (Debt of Honor)  and really enjoying the book, wondering how it would end.  Then, in the  last 75 pages I saw where Clancy was leading all of us, his loyal readers.  I groaned to myself and said, oh nooooo, not thattttt!  And guess what?  He  did it.  He took Jack Ryan from National Security Advisor to Vice President  to President in less than 5 pages.  Isn't popular fiction wonderful?  You  can put sh*t between two covers, put Tom Clancy's name on it and the  general reading public will think it's wonderful. Well, I'm here to tell  you it wasn't and isn't and Tom Clancy should be ashamed off himself for  putting such truly bad prose on paper.  Debt of Honor ended badly and  that's when I knew Clancy was well past his prime.  I should've guessed  that Executive Orders would not be any better.Executive Orders picks  up where DoH left off with our stalwart White Knight, Jack Ryan taking up  residence at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.  I couldn't believe the story line  but I plugged along. Ryan started out admirably and in some ways stayed  that way in EO but, the entire premise of his ascension to power was just  so preposterous as to make the novel laughable.For someone who writes  detail so well, Clancy lost sight of the fact that there would have been so  many factors that would have had to fall into place (exactly) to permit  this type of event to take place.  A 747 jumbojet into the capital would  just not happen, especially on the night the President is addressing a  joint session of Congress.  Air traffic is vectored away from downtown DC  to make just such an event implausible.I really had a difficult time  swallowing what TC was peddling in this overly long tome.  Readers may have  noticed that Tom has also developed a devoted following with his  non-fiction books such as &quot;Marine,&quot; &quot;Submarine,&quot;  &quot;Armored Cav,&quot; &quot;Airborne,&quot; &quot;Into the Storm&quot;  and &quot;Every Man a Tiger.&quot;  He does a great job with those books  because he can get into all the techno-detail that he puts in his novels  and he doesn't have to make it all seem believeable.  The stuff he writes  about in those books is here today and he doesn't have to make it  plausible.  He can write those books like the thoughtful student of the  military that he has proven he once was.  He should stay with the  non-fiction, special interest books he does so well.With Debt of  Honor, Executive Orders and Rainbow Six, Tom Clancy has proven to be a  caricature of the author he once was.  He's really stinking rich now and  apparently given up on giving his readers a good read.  Now he just wants  to peddle Sh*t and get paid for it.Tell you what, Tom.  Why don't you  take your wealth, dabble in whatever it is rich folks like you dabble in  and forget writing fiction.  You had a few good books in you and you wrote  them.  Now you have nothing left.  It's time for a new hobby.",0
"I picked up a Patrick O'Brian novel looking forward to a voyage with the British Navy, only to find myself out to sea.O'Brian's series of 21 Aubrey/Maturin novels, detailing the adventures of two friends in His Majesty's service during the Age of Napoleon, are among the most widely respected in literature. Getting into the series here, with Book 16, was not an optimal approach, but it was the only book of his I had at hand. To me, a good novel should stand or fall somewhat on its own. That was where ""The Wine-Dark Sea"" failed.Part of the problem is that I found myself joining Captain Jack Aubrey and his physician friend, Stephen Maturin, in the middle of an adventure, with a crew of people O'Brian took pains introducing long ago. Mention is made of battles recently fought, a mysterious woman rescued, and intrigues ongoing, all of which seems part of a bubbling stew just beyond our ken (published in 1993, ""Wine-Dark Sea"" comes near the end of a run of seven novels in eight years).But even if I had read this in order, I doubt I would have enjoyed ""Wine-Dark Sea"" much. It's a highly episodic novel with a slow narrative and no real central plot. Aubrey and Maturin are now aboard Aubrey's privateer ""Surprise,"" catching unfortunate whalers and merchantmen while Aubrey plans to unsettle French ambitions in South America. But O'Brian is less interested in all of this than laying out various nautical details in mind-numbing detail.His love of the recondite overtook his interest in story, and sent me to the computer to look up more than a hundred terms. A few escaped me even then, but I did enjoy the result when I Googled ""dumb-chalder"" and saw one of the results: ""I've read all 21 of them thrice and I still don't know what cross-catharpins, Bentinck shrouds, or a dumb-chalder is."" So I'm not the only person who struggles with O'Brian.Battle scenes are over in half a page while O'Brian chews over the state of repair of the yards and masts of the ""Surprise."" Worse follows when Maturin makes landfall in Peru, for what starts out a potentially exciting espionage story but turns into an 19th-century episode of Wild Kingdom, with O'Brian glomming onto various items of flora and fauna which Maturin collects for dissection. I guess James Bond started out as a bird enthusiast, too.O'Brian does create a sense of total immersion in his world for the reader. You do get the hang of the pitch-perfect period lingo, to the point that when it was observed at one point that ""spotted dog"" was on the ship's menu, I knew at once they were eating shark and not Fido. I do enjoy the idea of the books, and the byplay between the captain and physician gets better after they get split up for a while and have something new to say to each other. (The rest of the crew doesn't stand out; several clearly being characters you are supposed to know from the prior books.)The novel ends as it begins, with Aubrey and Maturin still at sea, somewhat at a loss but happy to be alive. If you like these guys already, you may find ""Wine-Dark Sea"" a cheerful way of extending their company. But as a stand-alone novel, it doesn't stand up. I guess I should have begun at the beginning, but a good novel would have done a better job entertaining me even though I hadn't.",0

"My friend gave me this book since she knew I liked historical novels.  Let's get one thing straight.  This is a fictional account on some historical and empirical facts.  So with that in mind, this book is nothing else but a harlequin romance novel.  If you enjoy this genre, then you will like this book.",0
"Why bother chiming in with review number 1,605? The verdict is in. Most readers (at least those who post reviews) love this book. Everybody who told me to read it (five or six reader friends) guaranteed enjoyment. I like those guarantees. Unfortunately, there's no such thing.Good things about ""Water for Elephants:"" Atmosphere Period detail (a rundown traveling circus from 1931) Old man's voiceNot so good things about ""Water for Elephants:"" Run-of-the-mill imagery. Examples: ""His eyes drill into Marlena. His temple pulses."" ""Flailing my arms like a windmill."" ""I blush so hard my scalp prickles.""  (Really?) ""The roustabouts, once roused, run about like headless chickens.""  The terrain is as ""dry as a bone."" ""I leave though every bone in my body screams against it."" There's not too much doubt about where the story is going, even from early on. We know Jacob will be successful, despite predictions he won't last a week. Tension is low throughout. Protracted scenes--such as Lucinda's funeral and the long strip-tease scene at the beginning. To what end? Perfect characters--too perfect. The sadistic hothead. The charming circus girl. Etc.In the end, the good things about the book were buried under the weight of the not-so-good. I left feeling like I'd been chewing on something tempting and sweet but ultimately unsatisfying, like cotton candy.",0
The books is an easy read with an interesting plot. Characters are not that interesting and the quality of writing is overrated.,0
"I can only second what many reviewers before me have remarked upon: the book is far too long, too wordy and too repetitive to stand in comparison to volume one to three.I think GRRM just isn't the same personality anymore that he was when working on the first three volumes. And although he always assured us that he was diligently working on AFFC first and then ADWD, I think he has done about diddly squat in all that time. You just had to look at his NAB every few weeks: ""NFL this and conventions that..."" that's all it was about. It's all his life is about now, I suppose.Then when that HBO deal came along, the cunning salesman acknowledged an opportunity: ""Hey, lots of additional publicity!"" So, for the first time in years he sat down to really work a bit on ADWD, only to find out that he had changed so much he couldn't get access anymore to his own creation.To remedy that he wrote. A lot. Trying to immerse himself in the world and characters his readers wanted to hear about. Sadly, all his efforts turned out to be just finger exercises. He doesn't have a grip on the characters as he created them anymore. That's why they all behave so strangely out of character, imo.And he seemingly has no idea where to take the story he started. It was all clear once, but now it's muddled in his own mind.  That's what outlines are good for, but GRRM is a ""freewriter"", ""a gardener, not an architect"". Moreover it's been so long, many readers have guessed the originally planned grand revelation: J=R+L. So, out of the lunch box comes young Griff, just to show these pesky readers that GRRM is alwasy good for a surprise. It all feels forced, added on and not thought through.Even the prose is different now, much coarser, many and more repetitions, archaic expressions and catch phrases.I didn't buy this one, in fact I cancelled my 2008 pre-order as soon as I was informed the book would be ready for delivery in two weeks time, so appalled was I by his conduct on the NAB (water damaged goods, anyone?). And I won't bother with the next if ever it should come out in my lifetime. I don't want the characters and storyline that I once loved spoiled anymore in my mind than he has managed to do with this clunker of a book.",0
"I felt like a bouncing ball in a porn shop rolled onto a circus train!  Between the poor character development to the stampede and the over dramatized porn and superficial sex scenes, I can honestly say that I would NOT recommend this book.  (Oh, and during the stampede, ALL these animals were in the big tent at the same time? without handlers? Why would Rosie be chained in the big tent during a show?)One of the primary editorials  states: ""Jacob is the only person in the book who has a handle on a moral compass and as his reward he spends most of the novel beaten, broken, concussed, bleeding, swollen and hungover.""Believe me, he may have started out as a moral compass, but he went down hill fast until he had no morals left.",0
"How on earth did this rubbish get published? To quote another reviewer..""I don't believe I'm still reading this thing.""Warning: Spoiler !We are immediately led to believe that a criminal defense lawyer with 15 years experience is shocked that her client is guilty. She feels used and vows revenge even though the jury is due back before lunchtime the next morning. I am sure had the lawyer been male, he would have laughed with the client, but we are led to believe that this female attorney is outraged that her client lied to her!!Even the case itself is stupid. An apparent clear case of self defense. The DA has nothing and yet not only does the trial last 2 months, but the defendant has been remanded in jail for a year without bail !!The judge on the case is up for the state supreme court even though he is only a district court judge.What follows is a disastrous, unbelievable race to find evidence that will somehow enable the client to be convicted. Most of the 'evidence' that is found would never be admissible anyway.Our `hero' tampers with the jury, drives to her clients beach house, breaks in, finds papers for a boat, breaks into a boat yard, breaks into storage, finds a boat, finds a map with a pin hole, spends hours digging in the freezing cold, finds a box, finds a computer printout. Why her client has kept this printout is beyond me since it became worthless a few hours after they used it.Everyone treaks across the city in knee high snow. Spend hours outside in driving blizzard conditions.  Then, everythings falls into place, everything becomes clear and it is a race to the court house.  The end comes quickly.  Then the really stupid part, the police show up with WARRENTS!!  I mean, how? why?  There would be no warrant without an investigation and evidence. The only person who spoke to the police in the whole book was the jurist who knew next to nothing.Our hero would be charged with countless offences and would probably never practice law again.Stressing me out just writing this review.. stupid book.",0
"I just wanted to add my one star review because this book doesn't deserve its three star rating. My wife was disgusted by the torture porn, and I was as well, not because I'm a prude but because it was too graphic and totally unnecessary. It didn't add to the story at all.GRRM has taken a page out of Robert Jordan's craft and is now turning his fans against him with endless discussion of food, finery, unnecessary descriptions of things that don't matter and pissing off the end of things.I quit the book after 200 pages, my wife quit after 150. Like others, we loved the first three books and the last two have been painful.How GRRM can repeat the mistake Robert Jordan made is beyond me.",0

"Plenty of reviews here with the same sentiment, but I'll chip in my two bits.Martin got three solid books out of this series...then it went off the rails with ""A Feast for Crows"" and ""A Dance With Dragons"" continues the train wreck.  I think his honesty to the story is getting in the way.  It is like no character can *ever* achieve their basic goal (or any goal for that matter).  Tragedy always ensues which sends the story in yet another new direction (complete with 1000 new irrelevant characters). It's impossible to fall in love with any of the characters.Too many new characters, too much useless traveling, constant soul-searching by various characters, and way too much descriptive prose (I don't know why he has to go into 3 paragraph details about a simple meal, or describe in excruciating detail the 4,000th coat of arms of some character that you will never hear from again) - it all grinds the story to a halt.Personally, I'm going to skip the next book and MAYBE pick up the 7th, as I do have an interest in what happened to (what's left) of the original characters.Damn shame - Martin really had something good going on there for a while.",0
"This audio CD does not do justice at all to the story. Every man portrayed sounds like a pirate with a bad cold, and about 70 years old regardless of the age of the character.  If the voice is not an old phlegmy pirate it is the voice of a dumb cockney street urchin. Dotrice robs the female characters of all depth and meaning. I have listened to all the audio books of this series and all suffer, but this is by far the worst. A new reader for this series is badly needed.As far as the book itself, I confess I want to see this story to the end but this is way to dragged out and slow. The book plods along interspersed with important and or exciting events only rarely. Could be so much better. Perhaps I will take the HBO route instead.",0
"If the only book you have ever read was the Waikicamucau (pop. 13) telephone directory, then this would be the second-best book you ever opened.If you are 9 years old or younger, you may find this as exciting as eating spinach. Without salt.If you are sophisticated enough to realise that a story should be credible, make sense, and entertain you - then leave this book on the shelf.There's a four-letter word: it starts with CR, and rhymes with PAP. You should know it. It's extravagant praise for this book.Avoid this book like the plague. Avoid anything written by James patterson like the plague. In fact - if you are given a choice, take the plague. You'll feel better.",0
"Not once while reading this book was I emotionally hooked -- unless you count my anger at the author. For all Gruen's indepth research into circus life of the 1930s, the atmosphere of the narrative felt wrong. The dialogue sounded far too contemporary and the stage directions -- ""I looked out the window""; ""He moved his jaw before answering""; ""I looked steadily at her then looked away""; and the dramatic ""in the distance I heard the sound of a camel"" -- were intrusive. Add to that the constant  cutting back and forth from young-buck Jacob to retirment-home Jacob and you feel not that you're immersed in another world, but rather reading the script of a touching Hallmark Theater production.The characters are from central casting: the good hearted whore, the tyrannical boss, the crazy husband and his sweet but long-suffering wife. And the noble hero. Young and bereft of family, Jacob stumbles into circus life and is hired as a vet. He is painted as the champion of the small and weak, regardless of sex or species, always wanting to do good and right. And yet, at the moment when his friends need him most, he's gone, taking their only means of protection, a knife, with him. And the elephant for whom he professes deep affection he leaves to the hands of a crazed maniac, to be beaten not once but twice, and our hero does nothing about it. How can we possibly cheer for him?Too bad the story wasn't told from the POV of a minor character named Greg. Greg shows up twice, first when he retrieves the elephant using what he knows she loves, booze. He shows up later ministering to her wounds from one of the beatings. He's speaking Polish to her, the language she understands. Why did we need Jacob? Sounds like we already had a vet, and a worthy hero, standing in the wings.",0
"What happened to a Song of Ice and Fire.I still remember being gripped and hooked by the first three books in the series. The books were big but never long to read. I devoured the pages. Scenes still stick out in my head. I loved the way Martin confounded my expectations at every turn. How he twisted the characters and how the POV made everyone seem right. I enjoyed the way he turned Jaime Lannister around in a Storm of Swords. Martin was a writer at the height of his powers but then the inevitable fall began.The downfall started wtih Feast and it was a torrid bore. It felt big, there was no tension, there was nothing I could take away from the book. Dance I thought would be better but it too disappointed with everyone just walking from point A to point B. I could hardly believe that this was the same Martin who penned scenes like the Red Wedding. The introduction of the Direwolves set everything up wonderfully. In that one scene you knew who the characters were, what sort of world this was. You knew that Jon Snow was a bastard, one of the Starks and yet not one of them, you knew that Eddard Stark was an honorable man. The entrance of the Lannisters was magnificently written. The twists just kept coming and all the while the writing was stellar. Tyrion just delivered. His wit and piercing insight into affairs made him everyone's favorite dwarf. You could almost always feel the pain when Littlefinger spoke of Catelyn Stark. The story always moved forward. There was no room for standing still. Martin possessed this ability of introducing characters but you felt as if you had known them all along but the magic just vanished.Feast and Dance were soap opersa in which it made absolutely no difference if you skipped pages and scenes because you became reasonably sure that nothing of note would really happen. There was some memorable stuff but they were so scattered and so few in between that it was worse than trying to find a needle in a haystack.Worse than this was the fact that no mainstream publication seemed to take a stand and say that a Dance with Dragons was boring. Everyone was effusive. It was almost as if they had been paid to do a positive review or they didn't want to risk saying anything contrarian.Martin was on song in the first three books but he just seems to have lost his muse. I hope he rediscovers it in the Winds of Winter and keeps it focussed and stops it from meandering about.From [...]",0
"This series (I read all of them) was good, and is truly, as A.C. Clarke said, &quot;The best book on the colonization of mark&quot; that has ever been.That being said -- come on! There was a lot of crap in these books.  Elusive characters that each have one big, fat character trait (Maya is  angry and flighty, Frank is petty and scheming, blahblahblah, Jackie is  scheming). Little quips about Japanese, like throwing &quot;shigata ga  nai&quot; all the time (I live in Japan and speak Japanese, and cringe  whenever a write has his characters speaking Japanese &quot;because it's  the future&quot;). (Are you listening, Gentry Lee???). Way too much detail  about the terraforming bit of it, and for all tha it was not believable  (that gene therapy that allows people to live in high CO2 environments was  just SO convenient).What this series does best, strangely, is paint a  reasonable, interesting picture of what Earth would be like in the future,  with multinat corporations and what not. Also, the best description of how  robot factories and space elevators might work -- that was interesing.All in all, this work would have been far better as one 600 page book,  instead of three 500 page books. That would have been just golden.",0

"This the last George R. R. Martin book I will waste my money and time on.  I absolutely loved the first four books of this series.  At the end of the 4th book Mr. Martin said that originally all the material was to be included in the 4th book, but since there was so much it had been divided into 2 books.  Ok.  But if that was truly the case, why did it take so long for the subsequent book to be released?  Even so, I waited until finally Dance With Dragons was released.  What a tremendous disappointment!  Absolutely NOTHING was resolved!So I'm done.  Done with this series and with George R. R. Martin.  You've gotten the last of my time and money that I'm willing to waste on this silliness.",0

"Can a stint of a few months in a circus change a boy's life forever? Yawn. The novel is peopled with cut-outs: a diligent country boy orphaned the day before his final exams; an ethereally beautiful horse-tamer with a secret problem (a loutish husband); perverted dwarves; whores with golden hearts; etc. Retold from a retirement home, the novel seems prepped for cinematic treatment, and doesn't linger in literature. It hurtles towards a pre-ordained resolution: the match made in heaven, in the book, and a movie contract for the author. Boo.",0
"The first part of the book is good, when Stark is looking for Alkland, but when Stark decides that Alkland has a problem with his dreams the book is boring and so it keeps till the end, how can a person write so many words and don't say anything?

This book doesn't have anything about that, everything happened in Stark's dreams and in the dreams there are no future, present or past.",0
"Six years is a long time to wait for the second half of ""A Feast for Crows"", because that is what this book is. Martin's previous book became so huge that he literally cut out half the chapters, covering half the characters and pushed them into this book. Thus this story covers the same timeline as the previous, more or less, just from another viewpoint. More on that in half a hand of minutes, but first the reason I am still reading this series.George Martin does imagine a intricate and sometimes quite delicious set of intrigues. A cast of characters that seems to put Tolstoy to shame and a sweeping political situation mixed with injustices and wrongdoing that make the reader long to see favourite characters avenged. Martin does know how to weave a remarkable story, and that is surely the secret of his considerable success.Neverthless should we think for half a minute, there are certain things that really let this book down. There were times reading this book that I simply sighed and put it down, and each time my inclination to pick up the book was reduced.Stylistically, certain phrases are so over-used in this book that they have reached the point of immense distraction. I am tempted to find the e-text of the book and count how many times ""half a..."" is used. Certainly it was not unusual to find the phrase twice in a single paragraph. Do the people of Westeros not have the word ""fifty"", and thus need to say ""half a hundred instead""? Other phrases like ""words are wind"" were put in entirely too many mouths, and just reminded me that it was just one author writing all these dialogues.Assuming that annoyance is just me, there are other problems. The most important is this story has become incredibly slow. This book and the last are filled with so much clever dialogue, character development, internal monologue and other page filling material that there was precious little space left for action.This is not helped by the multiple point of views used. Each chapter is told from a different character's point of view and the timeline goes back and forth as each character is given page upon page of development. All in all, this is a text book example of a story that is totally over-written.Then there is the world the story is set in: Westeros is just another faux medieval land with swords, sorcery (not much of that mind), dragons and knights and really nothing to distinguish it from the great raft of Tolkienesque literature, except the lack of elves and the number of pages.What really did it for me though was the incessant crudity and vulgarity. Some people will like that in this book I suppose. They will say this is a more earthy tale than Tolkien's. For me though,this book contains probably my most disliked passage I have ever read. I presume the author's intent was to make the character involved seem seedy and base, and to his credit, he succeeded in spades. I am no prude when it comes to books, but I don't want to read this, and this will be my last Martin book. I presume it will be another 6 years before the next in the series (if we all live that long), but when it comes I do not intend to buy it.This is not a series I can recommend anymore. The author has lost his way, and the early promise is coming to nothing. I wonder if I have correctly predicted the end - but I find I no longer really care.Two stars because despite my dropping this series, I do think the author has produced some good story here. If you can be bothered to wade through all the over-written stuff, you may find half a hundred reasons to enjoy it.Finally a note on the audio version of the book. This is extremely hard on the ear beause the narrator has a tendency to. Punctuate mid sentence.Every single sentences seems. To contain punctuation to interrupt the thought.I do admire the narrator's ability with accents, but his femal voices all just sound daft.",0
"Well, I read the Sarantium series and on the strength of those very good books plus the strong reviews on here I picked up the 'Summer Tree' for a...well summer read (ok, sorry)! Anyway I struggled and struggled through it. NOT a page-turner, but I hate not finishing what I start (and pay full price for!). The Summer Tree just seems so random and unconvincing. Obviously it is fantasy but there is absolutely no explanation or even much hint as to why these five Canucks are somehow chosen to save Fionavar. Maybe it is explained in later books. The dialogue lacks any humor whatsoever which might have made the story more tolerable. There are just these heavily oppressed characters who suddenly become great fighters or seers or whatever. How a graduate student rides a horse for 5 days and fights from horseback is just too ludicrous. I am a little sad I won't know the end of the story but just a very little. There are just too many good books out there to justify finishing the series and that pains me but just can't bring myself to do it.",0
"As much as I loved A Game of Thrones, liked A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords, I disliked this book  Also hated A Feast for Crows.  Self-indulgent, wandering purple prose going nowhere, a total waste of time.  If you're hoping for some resolution for the characters you've grown to love and hate, forget it.  They are all just left in limbo.  Martin should have stopped while he was ahead because this definitely left a bad taste, a feeling he just spewed it out to make some more money.",0
"Fortunately, I didn't pay full price for this book; I borrowed it on my Kindle through my Prime membership.The author found some interesting true circus stories but wove them together poorly. The book read like a treatment for a screenplay, in that it seemed less like a novel than an attempt to sell a script to Hollywood. The characters all sounded the same, and the dialogue was too modern for the time period of the novel. I have not seen the movie, but I think it would at least be visually interesting to distract from the plot. The love story is barely believable and the villains are archetypes--you've seen them before.Not very deep, but the animals are interesting. Much more so than the people.",0
"This is not one of his best, but considering what manure or tree wasters he has written, this is almost good. I have stopped reading this author, he seems to get paid by the word and in later books puts in subplots that have nothing to do with the book so he can make political or religious statements.Buy this book second hand, and keep it handy for a camping trip. It will give you something to read on rainy days and will give you a nice supply of toilet paper.",0
"I picked this novel up in the airport as I was waiting to get on my flight to Orlando, mostly because it is coming out as a movie and I wanted to read it before seeing the movie.  That's my general rule after all.  And I was sorely disappointed.In this historical novel, Jacob Jankowski, the protagonist, has left Vetrinary school at Cornell after suffering the loss of his parents, who have died in a tragic car accident.  He learns fairly quickly that his father, also a vet, was heavily in debt and actually died owing money.  So Jacob leaves school and his home and literally joins the circus. He travels cross country with the circus, acting as the show's vetrinarian and working under August, the head trainer and Uncle Al, the show's ringleader.  August is an interesting man, alternately charming and brutal.  He's also married to the beautiful Marlena, a performer, that Jacob forms a special bond with. This novel is about Jacob's relationship with Marlena, with the new elephant, Rosie and with Uncle Al.There are definitely several themes that are prevalent in this novel, which are super easy to pick out.  Water is for cleansing, for instance and the train tracks are for choosing a life path.I was not impressed by this book at all.  The themes were easy to spot and the ending was just as easy to spot.  The characters were shallow and one dimensional and I found myself annoyed with them more often than I was intrigued by them.  I just didn't really like it - I kept expecting it to get better and it didn't. It was a complete and utter failure.",0
"This was the first novel I've read by Sydney Sheldon.  The character development, plot development and prose is drivel compared to books by Greg Iles, Joseph Finder, Nelson DeMille, Richard Crais, Michael Connelly, Sheldon Siegel, and Richard North Patterson.  Its so bad, I'm throwing the book out so I won't make the mistake of rereading it.  Raise your standards people!",0
It was interesting in a many worded way. The author had too many unconnected threads of plots that eventually wove together but it was a struggle to get to that spot.,0
This book just wasn't for me. Its not the writing at all. It's very descriptive and written very well. It's just too dark and depressing for my taste. It put me in a funk. I don't recommend reading this unless you don't mind reading a good story with a whole bunch of downer situations.,0
"This was the first Plaidy book I'd read in years, ever since high school actually. I remembered loving her stuff back then, but as I read this one & The Sun in Splendour, I had the sense that the books were copiously cribbed histories with a minimal effort at dramatizing the whole thing. (No doubt a reason why she was so prolific.) The dialogue shows no real spark and is absurdly simplistic, and the pace is about as brief and deep as an encyclopedia article! From scene to scene, the same phrases and thoughts were repeated, as though we could have forgotten! Katherine of Valois is just a woman talking, not a friend or a confidante or even a real person, and this reader eventually didn't care. The reader is told who are the characters are, not shown.So it was disappointing to realize that Plaidy's style isn't all that good, after years of nostalgia, but that's the way of so many childhood authors, I guess! I suppose that Plaidy is a good author to start with for a time period/royal personage, and then read a novel that is more focused and has more depth & narrative skill. IE, read Plaidy's Sun in Splendour and then Sharon Kay Penman's novel on Richard III. Do NOT read them in the reverse order, as I did, else you'll also be stabbing your eyes at Plaidy's dry, uninspired prose with the memories of Penman making it all the more excruciating. Better yet, save lots of time and read a Wikipedia entry and then grab Penman.",0
"I beg to differ with some of the reviewers who call &quot;Furnace&quot; a great read and compare author Muriel Gray with the likes of King and Koontz.  Oh, the book starts out with enough action to set the tone and keep the reader involved, but unfortunately, starts to lose steam near the halfway point.Trucker Josh Spiller finds himself trying to decide if saving his relationship with his now-pregnant girl friend is worth the effort.  As he tries to sort out his thoughts while on the job, he makes a &quot;wrong turn&quot; into the town of Furnace, Virginia, where his life becomes changed forever.There's no denying that Josh is a solid enough character, but I can't really say that any of the other characters will extend too far beyond your short-term memory limits.  The writing is uneven enough to make the plot jumpy and somewhat hard to stay with.  And, the &quot;hold&quot; that local witch, Nelly McFarland, has over the locals is just a little too much to believe.As the plot finally decelerates to it's inevitable climax, you won't be either surprised or overjoyed by the conclusion;  maybe just relieved that it's over.  But, don't take my word for it, because a number of other reviewers obviously think differently.  Just don't say you haven't been warned!",0
"I'm an X-Files fan and I saw this in Indigo, so I bought it. And what a waste of money!!! Not only is this poorly written, but characters are poorly developed. Mulder spends his time checking girls out, and you can see Charles Grant must be obsessed with Scully, because 75% of the book is about Scully. Most of the chapters start with ""Scully"", and Mulder is in mostly the non-important parts. Yeah, I think Scully is hot too! Can we move on please? Plus what was with all the swearing? The only time they'd cuss in the show was in the episode ""Bad Blood"" (where they use the S-word right at the very beginning), and even the ending doesn't make any sense.I'm not going to say another word, this is just trash.",0
"SPOILER ALERT: George r.r. martin is a putz. Any author that kills off the main character at the END of a book should neverbe published again. PERIOD. Note, it's been 3 years since he wrote it, with no resolution. I will never read anotherGeorge rr f.---ing Martin book again.",0
"Though the story kept my attention enough to continue reading to the end, the storytelling is lacking. Splitting up the storylines into two books that take place at the exact same time is a terrible mistake and only made me lose interest in other characters. Out of all of the books, this book has the least action as well--nothing dramatic happens as compared to the sinister nature of the other books.Martin has a lot of work to do to appease his readers in the next book. I hope he can pull it off because otherwise he's set himself up to a lot of pressure and with the tv series he's only attracting attention for what may be a dramatic failure.",0
"In this book, Martin introduces several more variously important characters, has several of the characters we know turn into people we don't recognize, most notably Tyrion. He produces plot complication after plot complication.Every thread ends with a cliff-hanger. It is as if Martin wants this series to outlive him, not figuratively as having its reputation live on but literally. He wants to die leaving his readers wanting more.Fine with me but I'm done with it.",0
"'A Dance With Dragons' drags along at a snail's pace, leaving you literally begging Martin for something interesting to happen.When the few interesting parts do finally occur, you are already too beaten down by overly descriptive minutia to feel that the book has vindicated your hard earned reading time.And seriously, wtf is up with all the food and wine references? I've had my ""fill"" of Dornish wine. More substance please!I fear that the glory days of the 'A Song Of Ice And Fire' series and those wonderful first three books are long gone. It eerily reminds me of how the 'Star Wars' movies progressed: From entertaining and thrilling stories with characters you actually care about, to painfully tedious boredom.Fool me once (AFFC), shame on you. Fool me twice (ADWD), shame on me.I won't be pulled into buying another installment without being patient and reading the reviews first. Martin may not care about my time and what I feel is enjoyable, but I do.",0
"The language is poetic, but it is not poetry.  It works as prose poetry, in fact some of the best in English.  That is probably because Gibran somewhat mimics the poetry of the King James Version.  Some phrases and turns and images are brilliant.That said, what is the point of this book?  There are some nice things.  ""Is not religion all deeds and all reflections....  Who can separate his faith from his actions....  Who can spread his hours before him, saying, 'This is for God and this is for myself; This for my soul, and this other for my body?'""Good point.  There are several such nuggets.  But, you can tell why the hippie-set loved this book: it is spirituality devoid of religion.  Namely, this book can make you feel all ""cosmic"" without all that pesky Christian morality.  That bit quoted above, it is followed by: ""He who wears his morality but as his best garment were better naked.""Ah.  See what morals get you.  On crime and punishment, we get this ""It Takes a Village"" gem: ""And as a single leaf turns not yellow but with the silent knowledge of the whole tree, So the wrong-doer cannot do wrong without the hidden will of you all.""  See, crime is not the fault of the criminal, it is the fault of society.  ""The righteous is not innocent of the deeds of the wicked... Yea, the guilty is oftentimes the victim of the injured.""  See, if you self-righteous rich folk didn't oppress the meek poor folk, they wouldn't have to commit crime.I wonder how the injured rape victim victimized her guilty rapist.Generally, the twin credos of ""The Prophet"" are (1) any path to God is the right path, and (2) if it feels good do it.(1)  Thus, the pluralistic relativism of lines like:""Say not, 'I have found the truth,' but rather, 'I have found a truth.'  Say not, 'I have found the path of the soul.' Say rather, 'I have met the soul walking upon my path.'""Forget that Jesus said, ""I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.""  (John 14:6, by the way.)  No, no, no.  Many willfully ignore that Jesus said such un-ecumenical things like this.  The hippie-Jesus thinks that there are many paths to God.  The whole ""one source, many wells"" philosophy.  Don't believe me?  Why do you think the folks at the Jesus Seminar blackballed this very verse (John 14:6)?  ""Our great, loving, hippie-Jesus believes that everyone comes to 'god' in his own way!  He would never say that!""  Blackball.  (That last quotation wasn't an actual quote, by the way.)(2)  And, though the nature of the good and evil chapter is tempered by a sort-of ""love thy neighbor"" philosophy, it still defines ""good"" not as following Judaeo-Christian morals, or even a ""do unto others"" prescription, but ""You are good when you are one with yourself.""If it feels good to you, do it.  Sure, Gibran later seems to warn against unbridled pleasure-seeking, ""Pleasure is a freedom-song, But it is not freedom.  It is the blossoming of your desires, But it is not their fruit.""  Later,  however, such hedonism is considered a path (""a truth"") to God:""Some of your youth seek pleasure as if it were all, and they are judged and rebuked.  I would not judge or rebuke them.  I would have them seek.""Thus the paradox of liberalism: the Prophet rebukes you for rebuking those hedons amongst you.  They are only on their path.  ""You are so wrong to tell them that they are wrong!""  Ah, relativism!  The problem with unchecked hedonism (""You are good when you are one with yourself,"" if you prefer) is that mankind always finds some inner reasoning to justify their evil actions.  Man always finds a way to make pleasure-at-any-cost, devoid of anything else, his god.I don't want to seem as if I am some stick in the mud, a prude, or an over-moralizing and self-righteous Christian.  Christian I am, and hedon I sometimes am.  I can get wheat from the chaff out of ""The Prophet.""  There is much here that is good, and some of it is artfully written.  Some of Gibran's thoughts are even profound.  Still, there is much here that is bad, there is still some shuck on the ear, so to speak.  Sometimes you must take the wrong path which leads you to the right path, but there is just one right path, not several.  Gibran never seems to say that, and, since he was a Lebanese Christian, I find that sad.There is much here to lead you astray.I will not hold it against Gibran that ""The Prophet"" has inspired numerous imitations of lesser-poetic talent, sad purveyances of even fewer truths.  Yes, I am speaking of (amongst others) the trite, inane cacophonies of Paulo Coelho.And, for those reviewers and readers who think that ""The Prophet"" is the most poetic, most enlightening, most cosmically spiritual tome of all time: try reading the Psalms in the KJV with an open mind.(Yes.  I invented the word ""hedon.""  ""Hedonist"" sounds like a philosophical school, as does ""epicurean.""  The latter, too, is for an aesthete.  Let's say a hedon is a pleasure-seeker without the philosophy.  A hedon is an unsophisticate.  I probably made up that word too.)",0
"I had read all of Tom Clancy's books up to and including this one.  But this one made me realize that now that the Cold War was over, so was my fascination with Clancy.  This book is part &quot;Tom Clancy's Public Policy Opinions&quot; and part virus outbreak, with a homegrown terrorist plot that, without giving too much away, ends up a major disappointment.  The virus plot is interesting, but the political plot wasn't to me.  Perhaps this is because I don't share Clancy's views, and he portrayed them as such basic common sense, with the opposing side so hapless in offering a rebuttle, that I was a little offended.  This also made me reflect on his previous books and realize even more that his characters all seem to be either really really good guys or really really bad guys with horrible character flaws.  There's never any shades of gray to his characters, and even the &quot;scandal&quot; that dogs Ryan is due to him being too noble for his own good.  Finally, I realized that with Jack Ryan as president, his days of dodging torpedos in a submarine were at an end, and thus, my favorite literary action character was being retired to a desk job.",0
"I have always been hesitant to read fantasy books because of their reputation of being long and overly detailed but the Game of Thrones Series has received such high praises that I decided to give it a try.  Boy, was I pleasantly surprised when I read the first three books!  They were quite good and moved along at such a pace that I couldn't put them down.  Unfortunately, then came the fourth book (A Feast of Crows) which was quite a slog to get through.  I told myself, that is okay.  Every writer has an off book.  Then came this book.........and was saddened that nothing has changed.A Dance with Dragons has proved to be just as slow and monotonous as the Feast of Crows with the story barely limping along.  The story has just become too unwieldly with too many pages spent on repetitive internal character development and on other characters that have little to no impact with the overall story.  A much better book could have been made by combining this book with the fourth book and editing everything down to around 1,000 pages.  I hate to say it, but I suspect that the only reason to keep these two books separate might be greed.  Why write one  book when you can write two and fill it with repetitive catchphrases and characters saying the same thing over and over?  It also disheartening that Martin has also released a short story book set in Westeros.  Great!  More characters and a chance to cash in!  It seems like you could skip every other character's chapters and not lose anything.To get an idea of the scope of the story, I painstakingly counted the characters listed in the appendix and came up with a whopping 935 characters.  Assuming that each book is about 1,000 pages long (some shorter and some longer) that averages to about one character introduced every five pages!  It has come to the point that when a character is introduced, I don't have the energy anymore to try to remember their name.  Having to read a book by using a wiki numerous times is not enjoyable.Although I really liked the first three books, I'm not sure I would have even bothered knowing what I know now.  With Martin taking many years between books I am starting to wonder whether this story will ever have an ending or whether it will go on and on for as long as possible so that Martin can milk as much money out of it.  If you haven't started the series, I would recommend that you don't even start.",0
"Man, I wanted to like this book. I really wanted to. I expected to be engrossed with it. I expected this book to provoke some deep thought and reflection in me. I thought the timing of my reading it was especially exciting, with the real-world preliminary discussion and planning for a true human mission to Mars possibly 20 years from now.What I did not expect was to give up on this book within 200 pages. But I did. And I'm pretty disappointed about that.The book's opening chapter involves a dramatic sequence involving several characters who are pretty clearly major players in the storyline. The narrative was B-rate, to be sure, but it was certainly good enough to continue reading, especially to give the story a chance to get its legs under it and really start moving.The next chapter covered the long voyage through space to Mars and what the voyagers had to do to prepare themselves for the red planet as well as passing the time as bored people with social needs in a confined place. Again, not an engrossing narrative, but it introduced secondary players and further developed the primary players, albeit as not much more than soap opera characters trying to negotiate love triangles and power grabs.In the third (massive) chapter, the voyagers finally reach Mars and touch the surface -- and this novel instantly turns into the near equivalent of a graduate-level geology textbook, and any joy or enthusiasm or intrigue or interest I had at that point utterly evaporated. Pages and pages and pages and pages and pages of descriptions about the different colors and textures of the Martian sand. Pages and pages and pages and pages about the different colors and textures and angles and depth of the ice at the Martian north pole. Pages and pages and pages and pages about the equipment that was needed to mine Martian resources and use the ice as a water source. Every now and then a character would display an exaggerated emotion in a quick, superficial way -- I guess just to show you that these characters are supposed to be distinct, real people and that these personalities would clash...eventually...as some point...if their geological expedition ever ended. But before those clashes would come, you'll have to read more pages and pages and pages and pages about the different angles the sun takes in the Martian sky based on the unique rotation and orbit of the planet.I mean, come on.I asked three people I know who have read through the book if I should give up or keep reading. Two of them encouraged me to keep reading but one told me to stop. But all three of them agreed that it was at times an excruciatingly boring read. And while I do like hard science-fiction, and I do enjoy the slower, dryer, more deliberate pace that much of hard sci-fi follows, that third, seemingly endless chapter of Red Mars killed the pleasure of reading for me.From what I've been told, the last quarter of the book gets exciting and intriguing. But I'm not trudging through days of joyless reading to get to it.I just don't understand the mindset of some authors -- especially in sci-fi and fantasy. It's almost like they challenge you to read hundreds of boring pages to make you &#34;earn&#34; your way to the good parts. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect a novel to move at a steady pace from page 1 and sustain that pace more or less until the final page. It's not like I read it for only the first 10 pages, and said, &#34;This thing is BORING! Screw it!&#34; I almost got to page 200, and it was a burden to read one paragraph more. That's not why I pick up a novel. And I doubt it's why you do, either.Note: I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because I do applaud the effort the author put into writing a book like this. I was impressed by the depth of scientific knowledge. Unfortunately, in writing the book, the author did not have a keen sense of when to pull back on the scientific detail and let a moving plot take over.",0
"Given all of the five-star reviews and the hype surrounding this book, I simply had to review.The good:  The overall setting and tone of the book were spot on. I really felt the genuine desperation of the Prohibition and the Depression.  The 1920s/30s traveling circus was interesting and well-researched.  Also the passages in which Jacob is 90 or 93 years old were beautifully written and very believable.The not-so-good:  The author often devoted long passages to the mundane and then just jumped over the parts of the story that a reader wants to spend time on (such as key dialogue between the main characters which would provide the reader with their back stories and develop a genuine love story)...which brings me to:The bad:  the characters are, for the most part, one-dimensional and the character dynamics and relationships are unrealized and unbelievable.  At its core, this is a romance and yet I never understood how and why the two characters fell in love.  They meet and next thing I know, they are in love.",0
"I have read each installment of this series as it has come out.  This is the first one I have refused to finish.Aside from being unnecessarily verbose, the story is told from no less than a dozen points of view.  There is only enough time to start to get the rhythm of one character's narrative before the text abruptly jumps tracks to another character.  As a result the myriad perspective changes read as nearly frenetic, and the flow of the story is quite disjointed.  This is more a collection of vignettes than a novel.  It almost gives the feeling that Mr. Martin has begun writing specifically for the purpose of an easy conversion to screenplay.",0
I did not enjoy this book at all. would not reccomend it. This certainly was not one of his better books.,0
"The author appears to be using a Soap Opera formula. You know where you watch the episode for 30 minutes and the plot progresses for about 15 seconds or not at all. I kept wondering, is this some form of writers ADD or has George gotten hopelessly lost in his own story lines. Too bad, this could have been a epic series, some of the story lines are fascinating and the character's rich but it has fallen and it can't get up.",0
"I am a very long time fan of Mr. Martin.  I still hold up the first 3 books of this series as the greatest fiction I have ever read.  Perhaps that is why the last 2 books have hurt so much.  The first three books were gripping, fun, suspenseful, shocking, inspiring and on and on.  This book just has none of that.  It has taken characters we have grown to love and watered them down and made them very dull and, in some cases, very dumb.  By the end of the book it seems the characters and the story is almost no further ahead than at the end of book 3.  Will I read the next book?  Yeah...probably...if for no other reason than I still have hopes that Mr. Martin can resurrect the drama of the first three.",0
"I've spent 5 months reading these books. Each book after the first becomes slow and tedious then bursts into fireworks. The big show in the last two books have not been worth it. We are introduced to too many minor characters and the characters we've come to know simply disappear, Sam for example. These books have become very unsatisfying. I don't think Martin has a clue as to how he's going to end this so he's endlessly dragging it out.",0
"After getting hooked on this fantasy series just looking for some closure, I  was sorely disappointed in this book and the series as a whole. There are few characters for whom we feel some sympathy and I got very tired of the endless torture and gore, with no resolution. My ending: Dany ends the wars and Jon becomes her husband. The dragons are tamed or banished and the Stark sisters are reunited happily. I will not buy any further episodes.",0
"This book has some good moments, but he really does need a good editor.At this point it's probably best to consider the 4th and 5th books as soap opera, not high fantasy. I detested the 4th book as it was truly boring and tedious to wade through. This one is marginally better but should have been much better.Aaaah well, you're probably best borrowing it from the library if you must read it. Don't pay full price for it.",0
"I'm surprised how well this book is reviewed. It is an interesting topic and Gregory obviously had to do some research to write a historical novel. However, I wished she had also remembered to work on her writing skills. I found this book to lack intimacy, which is so strange considering it is written in 1st person. At times, it was so detached and seemed to just be a run down of details. I didn't feel anything for Mary or the other main characters. Mary's voice completely lacked a personal touch. I didn't understand the main character's internal being, and the book was over 600 pages. Really good writers can make you feel for and understand a main character in a short story. With this book, I felt like I was reading a rough draft that hadn't yet been flushed out and revised to include richer word choices, better character connection, metaphor, etc. It just really lacked something.That said, I found the topic interesting so I went and saw the movie. The movie, though only 2 hours, demonstrated more of the character's thoughts and passions and fears and motivation than the book did. Usually it is the opposite - a book gives you so much more than a movie possibly can. Not in this case.",0
"I don't believe I waded through all that gore & guts to be left with no resolution. I 'm not sure I'll bother with next one, there aren't that many characters left that I care about!",0
"While the writers style was captivating and interesting from the very first chapter, the book became so much more graphic and crude than was necessary.  Some things are better left to the imagination.",0
"The first book in this series, the actual 'Game of Thrones', was incredibly interesting. It was a whole new world, with complex and well-developed characters. It was a world of wonder, of legend and of horror. Game of Thrones got me from its first page.Then came the second book. And I thought... Meh.Then the third book. MEH.The fourth book. ""Oh Lord, I hope the fifth is better than this ****!"".And the fifth book...A Dance with Dragons is one of the worst books I have EVER read in my life. More than a thousand pages long, and NOTHING happens. I really don't know what Martin was thinking when he decided to write this book.Okay, after the first book we already had clues that the series was not going anywhere, but one couldn't help but hope that such an incredible writer would be able to produce something good after so much time.Guess what? This book can't deliver.In fact, when I say that NOTHING HAPPENS in this book, I really mean it. The characters just wander around, CLEARLY filling pages. I don't know why would any editor publish this kind of work.I am probably not the only one, but I SHALL NOT buy the other two books, if they ever get released. This is simply one of the worst written works I've had the misfortune to read.Take this from a former fan: don't waste your money on this.",0
"Unlike Patrick Tull who has performed the readings on the previous fifteen books, Richard Brown is the reader on this CD production.  But Brown is no Tull.  His voice is dull and repetitive, and it has little differentiation between any of the characters.  More than that he doesn't seem to try and make the story interesting but seems to be in a hurry to get the whole thing over.  Whereas there is some great spirited writing in the book you wouldn't know it from listening to the CD, he could just as well be reading from the phone book.BTW the story is great as usual and deserves a four star rating.  So read the book or listen to the cassette.Zeb Kantrowitz",0
"If you have read all the previous books, expect another AFFC in term of general plot development and satisfying resolutions (not much).If you are new to the series I can only recommend to wait at least till the next book or even better till the end of the series.First three books were great and I would recommend them to anyone who has nothing to read, because they are very good by themselves.The last two volumes - ""A Feast for Crows"" and ""A Dance with Dragons"" are not that great. Almost nothing is really happening to move the plot ahead. You can get through them on a momentum gained from the first books, but if the series are never finished (Martin began to write them in 1991, so do your math) it will be just a waste of time and a source of disappointment.",0
"Herbert gets an extra star because he clearly spent a lot of time researching war time London. However, the good research wasn't nearly enough to save this novel. The premise of the book is that at the end of  the second world war, the nazis released some kind of virus that wiped out  most of the world population rather than admitting defeat. The problems are  as follows:1. He used a noir-ish tone for his characters, but it wasn't  well done and instead of stylish, it just came across as badly  written.2. The constant action scenes were better suited to a bad film  than a bad novel.3. The characters were cardboard cut-outs, and their  actions in relation to each other made very little sense at all.Total  summation: Skip this one.",0
"I did not like this book at all. In fact, I left it behind in a hotel in Britain hoping that someone else might find it more entertaining than I.",0
"Well, my entire class was assigned to read this book, and I wouldn't say we hated it... but it was pretty bad. It was essentially a soap opera on Mars. Ronbinson worded it well, but it just didn't have enough content to be enjoyable... to us, anyway. I would suggest reading it if you are older than a junior in high school...",0
"Schwarcz is a Professor of Chemistry who has written several books about diet and nutrition. Judging by this book I'm thinking he should stick to chemistry.I'm not saying that Schwarcz's dietary recommendations are bad. After you take away the discussions of chemical terms and processes you end up with the same sort of recommendations you've been hearing about for decades: Eat mostly foods based on vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and low-fat dairy, and don't overeat. Hey, is there ANY nutrition book out there that recommends eating mostly meat, fat, and sugar, and overeating?I majored in biology at college, so I thought that a chemistry-focused discussion of nutrition would be interesting. I was wrong. I can't really fault Schwarcz for that, because his book makes it clear that it will get into some chemistry, and many of the chemicals in foods have long, hard to pronounce names. But the subtitle to the book led me to believe that the chemistry discussion would be enlivened by learning about ""the myths, misconceptions, and truths about the foods we eat."" Again I was wrong, and this time I can fault Schwarcz. Schwarcz ends up recommending the same type of whole-food, unprocessed diet as any mainstream diet book, so I wonder just which myths and misconceptions he thinks he is addressing? He recommends that meat should be ""an occasional treat,"" and even then the portion size ""should cover a small portion of the plate."" Those people who still believe in the ""myth"" that humans need to eat lots of meat would sooner barbecue Schwarcz's book than read it. Regarding other myths and misconceptions, Schwarcz is covering old, well-trod ground. I suppose this book might be helpful to someone who has had his head in the nutritional sands for the past two decades.I can't forgive the chapter on milk. His discussion of calcium and osteoporosis is superficial at best. He doesn't address any of the major risk factors for osteoporosis, nor does he discuss the chemical processes underlying them, nor effective countermeasures. He doesn't offer a single study demonstrating that consuming dairy lowers the incidence of bone fractures, which seems strange considering that this is the dairy industry's number one claim to fame. Schwarcz does point to two studies which contradict his claim that milk is good for bones, but he blatantly dismisses them. One study shows that ""Asians have a lower incidence of osteoporosis than Westerners even though they consume less dairy."" Schwarcz responds by saying, ""True enough, but they also have a very different overall diet and lifestyle."" He leaves it at that, and he doesn't bother to say what parts of the ""very different diet and lifestyle"" are healthier! He then mentions the comprehensive Nurses' Health Study ""which found that nurses who drank two or more glasses of milk a day actually broke more bones and had a higher risk of hip fractures."" Schwarcz responds by subscribing to a hypothesis that the nurses who drank more milk were the ones who had the weakest bones to begin with! I say hypothesis because he has no evidence for it. To make things worse, Schwarcz goes out of his way to describe anyone who ""criticizes"" milk consumption as part of the ""antimilk lobby,"" driven more by an irrational agenda than any objective analysis of the evidence. I eat moderate amounts of dairy (for taste, not health), and I'm not part of any antimilk lobby, but does that mean I must believe that dairy foods are good for my bones? Schwarcz says that when we ""look at the totality of the evidence, an overwhelming number of studies show that bone strength improves with calcium intake, and dairy products offer the best source of calcium."" Schwarcz is linking dairy to calcium to bone strength, which in effect means he is suggesting that dairy is good for bones. But again, he doesn't offer even one study which gives any evidence for this claim, and instead shows us two studies which contradict it. Furthermore, Schwarcz dismisses ""antimilk"" arguments that no other species except humans drink milk after weaning. He's missing the entire point: the objective and telling observation that all adult animals on earth thrive without milk. Schwarcz would have us believe as scientific gospel that human adults, for special reasons he never explains, need milk to thrive and prevent bone fractures (except, of course, for those Asian human adults, who have very different diets and lifestyles!).This is the model of clear, rational, scientific thinking we're supposed to follow, as Publishers Weekly says, that ""leaves readers with a rational framework for evaluating the complex nature of foods and how they affect health.""? I'd say it's a great example of a cloudy, irrational, and incomplete framework. In the end, the best that Schwarcz can do is tell us that milk ""is not a poison,"" as some fringe members of PETA might say.In conclusion, Schwarcz did not bust any new myths or misconceptions and his recommendations are consistent with mainstream recommendations. You know the drill: Eat mostly veggies, fruits, beans, and whole grains, don't overeat, engage in enjoyable physical activities, get adequate rest. If you do all that don't worry about whatever else you like to eat!",0
"I will not forgive GRRM for not killing off Cersei in some horrible way. IF this series goes on long enough, if I live long enough to see it happen, maybe Tommen will grow up and  realize what a treacherous bitch his mother is and have her beheaded for trying to harm Margery. The only reasons I read this book were to find out what happened to Bran, the true lord of Winterfell, and to find out how Cersei died.  SOL on both counts.",0
I had a hard time figuring out if i was still reading the same author. The book made no sense. I believe GRRM is a little to full of himself. He is taking to long between books and I believe enjoys all the anguish this causes. I will not buy anymore of his books as he is just a wast of money. If you are thinking about buying this book just wait and it should be available at the library for free.,0

"I was taken over by book 1, had to have books 2 and 3, and even enjoyed AFFC. I couldn't wait for ADWD and bought the hardback right away;  but I didn't even finish it. I went to Wikipedia for the last 100 pages of the plot, or what is supposed to be a plot.  There was a huge increase in distasteful language  and descriptions in this volume. I guess this was to make Tyrion and some others more quirky & interesting. The whole Dragon Queen plot became totally Byzantine. I began to skim those portions. Jon's voice on the Wall became the same thing over and over. In fact, the whole book became the same thing over and over. What a waste of money. Before I started ADWD I was concerned about waiting 5 years for the next volume. Now...I could care less when it comes out! What happened?",0
"I picked up this novel with high expectations after the release of the movie and the adulation from writers such as Demille on the back of the edition proclaiming it &quot;masterful&quot;. Despite a good story and pacing, however, I didn't find much about this novel to live up to the hype it has received by come. Many of the major characters, notably the &quot;mysterious&quot; FBI agent Alex Cross falls for and the children kidnapped, seemed undeveloped and hollow and didn't add anything compelling except to serve as filler characters. The serial killer featured was the lone high acclaim I have...reminiscent to the portrayal by Edward Norton of a killer in the movie Primal Fear, the antagonist in Along Came a Spider is compelling and intriguing, forcing the reader to make decisions that set up the later resolution. The actually &quot;twist&quot; ending, however, was disappointing to me as well. Most endings  have elements that were at least SOMEWHAT foreshadowed earlier in the novel. Patterson's ending, however, seemed to come out of left field and was completely arbitrary, with no connections to earlier in the story; in effect it didn't do the madman of the story justice. It isn't a bad read...but after Baldacci's The Winner, Along Came a Spider paled in comparison",0
"Not much happens in this book.  The one before it I probably read 200 pages as I skimmed through, for this one it was probably closer to 50.  There just wasn't anything worth stopping for as I skipped around in this empy ghost-town of a book.On a more constructive note: The Name of the Wind, and The Wise Man's Fear are still great books you might enjoy instead.",0
"For a 5 book series, with a huge cast of characters, the author seems as though he just gave up tying it all together. If the purpose was to suck me into a 6th book, forget it! But, it seemed like he just got tired. Adios George, I won't be seeing you in your next realm.",0
"I have had this book for many months and simply cannot finish it.  I used to make it a point of honor to finish every book that I started and this one is more than I can do.  The first three books were great, hooked me on the story lines and characters and made me glad there was more to come.  I found the 4th (which I was able to just barely finish) and now this 5th in the series to be very disappointing.To call this author ""The American Tolkien"" is undeserved.  Both series are weighty, complex and deep, but Martin's has become simply shallow, repetitious, disjointed and boring.  It's a shame really because it started out with such promise. I don't believe it will stand the test of time like ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" have done.I have enjoyed the first book's HBO adaption and am looking forward to next season.  However, just like with the books, I find I skim over (fast forward) the sex scenes which have become soft porn and frankly, boring.I won't buy the subsequent books (if they are ever published) hot off the presses like I have previously until I know they are worth the read.",0
"I loved the first 3 books. This one was interesting in a way, but disappointing also. The introduction of the new characters, some from feast for crows, made me feel as if the author is just stretching the story, loose ends that hopefully will be tied up in book 6. I look forward to the new book, and hope that we won't have to wait so many years before we can continue reading it.It appears as if Jon Snow has been killed. I hope not, he is an interesting character, like his father, and the other members of the Stark family.",0
"I had high hopes for this book.  Lots of great reviews, an interesting setting I find fascinating, and a love story--not too shabby.  I didn't go in expecting literary greatness, but even so this book fell flat.  For starters, the ""old man reflecting from a retirement home"" is a tired technique and all those chapters bored me to tears. My main problem with the novel, however, is that the characters are one dimensional.  They always seem to be doing dramatic things and facing tragedy after tragedy, but I couldn't connect because there is very little reflection or internal monologue (not even in the retirement home!).  The story clips along at such a quick pace it gets bogged down by its own far-fetched events.  I found it difficult to understand why the characters, and even Rosie the elephant, act the way they do--everything seems trumped up to make the plot work. I can't say I even completely understand the title.  I got the connection to the man in the retirement home who claimed he carried water for elephants, but what in the heck did this have to do with the story?  Maybe I'm just not deep enough to understand!  Quite frankly, I didn't enjoy the book much at all and my advice would be to skip it.  Perhaps the movie is better.",0
This story line of this book goes on and on and has no ending.  All the kingdoms are left in chaos with no end in sight.  Because of this I would not recommend this book or the series to anyone.  It was very disappointing and the fact of the matter is I felt like I wasted my time reading all five books.,0
"That's what this book seemed to be...Endless.  It went ON and ON and ON  with irrelevant details about the main couples' relationship.  It takes over half this book just for them to get together.This book is NOT Christie's usual style.  This book takes a VERY slow build to an eventual murder that doesn't occur until 3/4 of the way through the book.  By that time...you just don't care.  The supporting characters appear in only brief moments.  Much of the action takes place ""off the page"" and you just hear about it after-the-fact.  Some of these things are significant.  Christie does a lot of telling and NOT showing in this book which makes it hard to get involved in.  The narrator is just reciting everything in his recollection.This is also one of Christie's last books and you can definitely tell.  Her writing style and format is completely different in this book.  She doesn't just stick to the facts and keep the story moving.  Instead...she's always up inside the main character's mind, constantly telling us what he's thinking and feeling and NOT keeping the story rolling along.  It's almost like she was trying to match the literary style of more contemporary writers of the time--1960's & 70's.  It does NOT work. I admire any artist for trying something new, but she needed to stick with the style she does best:  intro of suspects, murder, investigation...wrap up.I love Christie, but I cannot recommend this book.  It's not big, but I kept putting it down and it took me weeks to finish it.  If you want a great psychological mystery from Christie, go for Sleeping Murder and Toward Zero.  These are two of her BEST.",0

"I still maintain this opinion: when I run out of new stories by the really great writers like Lawrence Block, Joe Lansdale, Robert Parker and Dean Koontz, I start looking for mediocre writers to fill my reading time.  Authors like Stephen King, John Saul, Jonathan Kellerman and James Patterson spring immediately to mind.I get no feeling from any of these characters!  They are not real to me, they hold no interest for me.  It's like James is practicing characterization with only one goal in mind -- profound mediocrity.The scenes are also dull and choppy.  I get no sense of where the story is going because the chapters are monotonously too short and go nowhere.I found these tedious qualities to be evident in the other four books that I have read from this author.  I am glad I borrowed them from the library!  I shall not read this man's works any more; there's only so much bad literature that one can tolerate before one is compelled to expel it all...",0
"I want to start off by saying that i thoroughly enjoyed the first 4 books-yes, i said 4, in the series. With that being said, I want to say that this book did not remotely feel like one of Martin's books. I think that other readers will agree with me when I say that this book did not even feel like the previous 4 novels. ADWD disappointed me in the fact that it did not even have the Martinesque feel that the previous novels had. 2.5 stars, but not deserving of the curve.",0
"Reality can be harsh to happy endings. Evil is not always defeated, the hero does not always get the girl, and nobody ever really lives happily ever after. That's fantasy.Take, for example, the tale of a plucky fantasy author, battling to finish his life's work, who overcomes a six-year-long bout of writer's block to at last complete the fifth installment in his epic. It would be nice to think that the book thus produced was worth the wait. That would be the happy ending. But reality can be harsh to happy endings. ""A Dance with Dragons"" is not the book I waited six years to read, and to wish otherwise would be fantasy.George R. R. Martin's ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" series was never mere fantasy, but with each new volume, it is becoming more and more a daytime soap opera.Mr Martin famously spent the second half of the 80s working in television, and if I may jump to unwarranted conclusions, this experience seems to have helped him break new ground by infusing fantasy with some of the best aspects of TV--sharply-drawn, sympathetic characters, crisp, witty dialogue, and intricate plotting.He's also made clever use of catchphrases and personal mottoes to provide a kind of leitmotif to each character's story and give a sense of continuity and cohesion to the tale: ""A Lannister always pays his debts"", ""If I look back, I am lost"", ""You know nothing, Jon Snow."" More famously, he's gotten good mileage from his willingness to kill off seemingly key characters at surprising moments.Maintaining such a high standard of writing for even one book would have been an impressive feat. Mr Martin managed it for three, stumbled on the fourth, and after 20-odd years working on the series, the fatigue is beginning to show.The personal catchphrases continue to get good airtime, with ""a Lannister always pays his debts"" featuring five times, ""If I look back, I am lost (or doomed)"" six times, and ""You know nothing, Jon Snow"" an impressive 13. However, much of the other writing has become simply repetitive and lazy. The phrase ""words are wind"" also pops up 13 times in various character's mouths, ""much and more"" (meaning ""a lot"") gets used as hefty 30 times, but this is pipped for the number one spot by ""(s)he was not wrong"", at a teeth-gritting 33 times. These phrases have become less a leitmotif, more a pianist banging the same three chords over and over again.As part of the series' gritty image, Mr Martin has never been shy about including sex in his stories, but now he appears to be shoehorning it in, simply for its own sake. One character spends the night before a siege having graphic sex. Another pays a surprise visit to one of his generals--and interrupts the latter mid-coitus. A description of a man being burned at the stake takes time out to tell us what happens when the fire reaches his genitals.The habit of killing off characters has likewise devolved into self-parody. Having already killed off most of the expendables, Mr Martin spends most of ""A Dance with Dragons"" only appearing to kill off characters, but not really. One is apparently executed, but isn't. Another appears to drown, but doesn't. Yet another seems to be beheaded, but--well, you get the idea. The effect is a bit like the boy who cried wolf, and cheapens the book's finale, in which two key characters appear to die, since by then the reader doesn't believe for minute Mr Martin will actually follow through.The other major drawback to the wholesale slaughter among named characters is that Mr Martin spends much time introducing a slate of new characters in much the same way that the old Star Trek series used to introduce new red-shirts.What is left? Plot, but not much of it. Most of the characters spend their time somnolently staggering from A to B. There are sporadic bouts of frenetic action, to be sure, but the story itself continues to plod along, fairly aimlessly as far as I can see. With no resolution to any of the major plot lines anywhere in sight, it's increasingly hard to care about any of the latest crop of characters, knowing they probably won't live much longer than halfway through the next book (when and if it is ever published). It's only in the handful of chapters that ""Dance with Dragons"" shakes off its lethargy and wraps up in a number of cliffhanger endings.I would like to believe the series will get better, that all questions will be answered, all the plot lines will come together, but if there's one thing Mr Martin has taught me, it's not to believe in happy endings.",0
"I have on my shelf Red Mars, Green Mars, and Blue Mars by Robinson and I've had them for years.  When it comes to reading lengthy trilogies I really have to be in the mood and have plenty of reading time.  When I finally felt the time was right, I picked up Red Mars and started reading.  And reading.  Although the book begins with a murder and is a day in the future of the Martian colony, the story begins with the first hundred, a hundred people who will be the first to live on Mars, the ones who will figure out how to survive there with the tools and knowledge they bring with them.  The ship is described as rather like a bunch of cans tied together which seems silly, but it's one thing that makes good sense once they land on Mars and can use the modules for living quarters, etc.The ship sounds spacious for such a venture, yet people can't help getting on each other's nerves.  They group together promoting their own agendas, arguing and just generally not getting alone.  Then something happens, and voila!  All friends again.  For a while.  Then something else happens, and voila!!  They're at each other's throats again.  The same holds true once they get to Mars, with one group deciding to settle on the moon for a while instead of going all the way to the planet.  Although the first hundred are mostly scientists and experts in their fields, they act like children, not only in arguing to get their way, but also splitting into factions, each working on projects willy nilly as if there was very little planning.The next groups of people to settle on the red planet just seem to come as they please and include political groups, transnational companies -- all people with an agenda, hoping to can make money from or dominate the red planet with.  There seems to be little cohesion either in the actions of the Martian settlers or in the story itself.  For pages and pages, Boone, the first man to have landed on Mars, goes walkabout -- in land and air vehicles -- just thinking about what's going on.  Wondering who is sabotaging equipment and projects.  He meets other groups, stays and talks with them, learns nothing, and goes on his way.Books with little action and much introspection are not a new thing in literature and there have been some marvelous works of fiction in that vein.  The writing might be lyrical, the plot interesting, a seeming purpose to the overall story.  I couldn't get far enough into Red Mars to find if there is some of that there.  I had to stop reading because I was not enjoying anything about the book.  Had some of the characters had interesting qualities, I might have persevered.  But they didn't.  Nor did the story.  This book isn't for me.  But there are lots of people who enjoyed it and there are probably many more out there.",0
"So much has already been written about the shallow characters and implausible ending... So no need to belabor that point.However, I do want to throw up a Red Flag to those readers who, like me, aren't big fans of profanity. I listened to Water for Elephants on CD and found myself cringing repeatedly at the author's liberal use of the F-word. (And many other words.) Furthermore, the graphic sexuality felt like the author's attempt to titillate and shock her readers with needless cheap thrills. She provided ample details regarding the sexual habits of her characters whilst omitting more relevant ones regarding central relationships and motives.There was an interesting storyline in there somewhere. As to the rest, it could've been toned down.",0
"Thankfully I read this for free from the Kindle Prime lending library - I would not have wanted to actually spend money on this book.The beginning of the story with the older Jacob reminiscing was initially interesting but from there on, the story went downhill for me.For one thing, I couldn't shake off a distinct impression of deja vu as I read this book. Then it struck me that I was strongly remindedof Stephen King's ""The Green Mile"" when I read the old Jacob sections (very old man in an old person's home reminiscing about anoddly sentient animal while struggling to retain his identity in the face of unsympathetic caregivers). There's even the Popeye/Olive Oyl8-pager which is also referenced in ""The Green Mile"".  The Jacob/Marlena/August triangle was similar to the onein William Styron's ""Sophie's Choice"" (volatile charming Jewish man with a personality  disorder married to a younger sensitive woman, theyoung man taken under the older man's wing falling in love with the wife, resulting in violence and upheaval).But beyond that, the Jacob/Marlena love story was very poorly developed. Marlena never came together as a three-dimensionalcharacter.  When older Jacob talks about his wife and how she was his helpmeet at the beginning of the book, a weak, passive character such as Marlena was not the woman I pictured. I certainly don't understand why he fell so deeply in love with her. The ending was feel-good but nevertheless unsatisfying due to its lack of realism.The few plus points in this book are the quirky secondary characters such as Walter and Camel. The thematic setting of a traveling circus was also interesting but after reading the author interview included with the Kindle version, it seems a lot of the side plots and atmospheric color were lifted largely unaltered from actual instances the author read or heard about while researching the book.Given the hype, I didn't expect a book that I will barely remember in another month except for its similarity to other, better works.",0
"I loved this book at the start. The story was so engaging and ominous. The baby being run over at the start and the evil, evil, evil looking bird following Josh everywhere had me hooked. The characterization was ace too and I felt for Josh a great deal in many of his dire circumstances.But then the plot just got bogged down in hokey black magic mumbo jumbo. It lost control and just went crazy. Perhaps I didn't read it right or had other expectation but I think that it all could have been told in a better and less stupidly from that point on. Too bad considering such a strong opening.",0
"I was reading this book again the other day and after initially being sucked in, I was vividly reminded of how much I disliked it.The history is accurate, the writing style is both gripping and crisp. What is it, then? I suppose the characterization really bothers me.Whether it is Mary Boleyn, Hannah the Fool, Amy Dudley, or the main character (can't remember his name) from Earthly joys, in several different Gregory books I have read, the central character is the Exact. Same. Person. Give them a different name, a different background, but the exact same personality/values/relation to the world and characters around them.The person is unusually honest, kind-hearted, and guileless amidst a sea of corrupt people who admire him/her. The main character is generous to a fault, cares deeply about either Mary Tudor or Katherine of Aragon (depending upon which of the two is in the book), and looks down upon the antics of Anne Boleyn or Elizabeth Tudor (depending upon which one is in the book). The main character is always recognized by the historical figures as uniquely honest and wonderful in that way only Gregory's protagonists are. The main character does something self-sacrificing and generous and Katherine/Mary (or in Earthly Joys, Cecil) stands in awe or admiration of that other person's nave and unique generosity.That characterization is TIRED. And I think she is capable of more; I wouldn't be so sick of it if she wasn't a good enough writer that I've read four of her books.For God's sake, Ms. Gregory, you have amazing talent-- take on a new protagonist! Stop inserting the exact same character in every single one of your novels!In this novel, she wants to have it all ways with Mary Boleyn. Gregory wants her to be a guileless and innocent sweetheart amidst all these corrupt people (guileless to the point of utter stupidity for a Tudor courtier-- questioning why her family would want her to cheat on her husband with the king? Come on! Short of a mental impairment, she would understand at least the basics of the ambitious world she inhabits!) Yet Gregory also wants Mary to be a calculating and clever courtier like all the rest... She just makes Mary clever/wily whenever it suits the plot, and innocent whenever she wants to prove to us how wonderful Mary is. You can't have it both ways.She wants readers to get an ""insight into the psychology"" of these people, yet she makes Anne Boleyn a cookie-cutter villain (to the point where her book presents as the truth anti-Anne Boleyn propaganda invented by Boleyn's CONTEMPORARY enemies in the 1500s) and she makes Katherine of Aragon a cookie-cutter saint. If you want psychological realism, give them -depth- or give up the pretense that your own personal likes/dislikes are not coloring your characterization of them.My complaints aside, I will tell you that I was pretty sucked into it even a second time around... She's a good writer. I plowed through the first half of the book before the characterizations really started to irritate me.I'd still take this novel any day over the abomination that is ""The Virgin's Lover""... Good God, but that one makes me cringe. However, I'd recommend both Gregory's novel ""The Queen's Fool"" (same protagonist, as always, but a better novel) and the wonderful ""Earthly Joys"" before this (same protagonist, again, but so many unique things in that book to make up for it!)So, get ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" for a quick read, great historical accuracy, a blatant smear job on Anne Boleyn, glorification of Catherine of Aragon, and an annoying glance into the plot-shifting psychology of the exact same character who narrates every other Gregory novel (at least the ones I have read).But if you want a sublime Tudor era novel, go for Susan Kay's ""Legacy"".",0
"This book is an easy read - a straightforward, uncomplicated, simple story sprinkled with profanity, violence, animal cruelty, and sex.  I think if you like books about the downside of humanity then this book might interest you.  There's plenty of examples of human and animal exploitation.  The ""love story"" aspect between Marlena and Jacob is lackluster at best.",0
I lost this book after about the first 50 pages. I think that I did it on purpose. If I want to read fairy tales I will go back to the Brothers Grimm.,0
"This was a great story line, but I really get disgusted with the writers that think they have a free license to use the Lord's name in vain. It has become a disgusting passtime and all too prevalent &#34;thing to do&#34;.  And why do they do it? It adds nothing to the story. Just a disgusted feeling and sorrorful feeling for the author. It shows how the people of the world are falling away from God. That is one thing I miss with my Kindle, I always use a black marker and mark out that word from the sentences or stop reading the book altogether.",0
"Unaceptable. I can't cope with a digital edition more expensive then a printed one. As a matter of fact, digital editions should be 30-40% less than paperback.",0
"Personally, I did not find the characters compelling and the plot seemed made for a movie.  Not what I am looking for in a book.",0
"A few months ago when I started this series I was sure this set would be something I wanted on my bookshelves.  Game of Thrones was definitely a five star book in my opinion, but the books have been slowly deteriorating, A Feast for the Crows was decent, but A Dance with Dragons has been such a slow read.There are too many points of view, I feel detached from most of the characters because there are so many, I am also a little paranoid to get too attached to any character, I feel like the author could kill them off at any moment.Okay, now I just want to rant.  I thought all of Westeros would have had to come together by now to battle the Others or Whites or whatever the boogeyman in the north is. Is that going to be the eventual progression?  Honestly I think that with how slow the author has become about putting the books out he will be dead before anything interesting actually happens.  I mean, how many years did it take to put out this book, like 5.  I just don't want to invest more time if the next book is going to come out in another 5 years and NOTHING will happen!Did anyone else feel like George must have been hungry or eating himself as he wrote this, there seemed to be a lot of discussion about food in this book.",0
"I had to read this book as well as ""The Haunted"" after watching the movie on which, both novels are evidently based. I'm often amazed when a movie is better than the books. And in this case the movie was far superior! In writing, in plot, and pacing, the movie outstrips the books in a way that the author probably finds offensive.Do not waste precious time on these novels, rent the movie instead. If you must read a suspense novel, particularly a british one, read a great one! I recommend anything by Phil Rickman who is phenomenal to say the very least.",0
"I heard from a few people that this is a good read...  Not true.  The idea of the story is interesting, but it is written like a bad television-remake set during the time period.  I did finish it, but I closed the book angry and disappointed.  That being said- I realize that I'm in the minority and I've spoken to other people who really enjoyed reading it.  Just isn't for me I suppose.",0

Angus rapes our female lead several times.Donaldson  moved up from  Thomas Covenant. Covenant only rapes once.Sick book. If I  could give it a negative 5 I would.",0
"Martin is a very good writer. We have to understand that we're reading an ancient political drama, and a lot of the time in a feudal society people die. But Martin seems to forget that most people read epic fantasy books for a dramatic story of protagonist and antagonist with eventually the good side winning in the end. Its called an escape from reality for a reason. In the Song books, no one ever wins.As the series goes on it gets slightly more depressing. Not in the 'Harry Potter' way either, unless Harry dies in the first book and Hermione is raped every now and then. But in a way that seems that even when the series is all over, and even if humanity survives in the end, who really cares? Everyone you cheered for is either dead or crippled, and Martin is going to be discussing what the few survivors are eating or something.Overall I enjoyed the book, I'm just disappointed with the overall downturn of the series.",0
"once again mr martin has strayed off the story and ""A dance of dragons"" was a disappointment.  I had been waiting for some closure. Where is the war that was due? what happened to those characters we fell in love with in westeros?? book 4 went over the cliff and book 5 hit rock bottom.Please Mr. Martin get back in the groove, take us back to westerow and finish what was a stunning, colorful, whole heeated story so many of us fell in love with",0
"While this dictionary covers many Irish words, I most dislike it because it has NO pronunciations. It gives you all these wonderful Irish words, but no way to know how they're pronounced, unless you have a hefty grip on Irish pronunciations already. It is not a dictionary for beginners.",0
I went from checking the book shops and sites for years to get the next installment. I waited so long that I had to be refreshed as to the characters.Finally this book came along and it was such a disappointment that if it takes him 20 years to produce another it won't bother me. What a drag this volume was. A struggle to read.  I am not sure I even recognized some of the characters. A self absorbed effort from an author who appears to be dragging this out interminably.,0
The story itself has simply flown out of control. Martin has lost his ability to move the reader through the story. There are POV chapters which seem to be present simply for the sake of being there. Martin clearly needs an editor with the ability to tell him when he is going off on too many rabbit trails.Roy Dotrice's narration is mostly fairly terrible. When he voices almost any female character they sound like the leprechaun from old Lucky Charms commercials. Most of the character accents sound rough and bumpkinish; it's almost as if Dotrice is only capable of doing a very few voices and he's forced to stretch his limited ability over Martin's (far) too many characters.,0
"When I read a book, there should be characters that I can relate to and care about.  The immaturity of the characters gave the book an 8th grade/soap-opera feel.  There should be a plot that excites.  Not with this book.  It started out good with a murder and landing but it quickly descended into scientific minutae.  I'm not that interested in Mars dust or lunar cycles.  I gave up and didn't finish this book.",0
"This illegal price fixing which has been forced down our throat is sickening.The actual book is almost as bad.  The first 4 were pretty good, but few folks will even be able to get through this garbage.I hope the Government fines the publishers and puts a few in prison - now that would be a very happy ending!",0
"This is one the few books written by Victoria Holt that I've absolutely hated. Though Holt's writing is not formulaic, she does have a predictable pattern that I love: intelligent, but beleaguered heroine, an interesting backstory, a shadowy ""hero"" or two, and verbal wit, not to mention plenty of intrigue and lovely settings. Secret for a Nightingale is the story of Susanna, who grows up to become a nurse during the Crimean War after a horrible marriage. Holt's attention to detail is present, as is her usual intelligent and independent heroine; the mystery is somewhat interesting, but the so-called hero is not. Susanna's driving force to do good and succeed on her own is to get away from her bad marriage and the memory of her dead husband's opium addiction. However, the ""hero"" of this story is the man who led her husband astray, and horrifyingly enough, he spends most of the book convincing Susanna that her husband's weakness was all her fault! What's worse is that she believes it, and she is frequently overcome by her strong attraction to the ""hero"". I read on to the end because I hate not completing a book, but I closed the pages not with a sigh of enjoyment, but with a grimace filled with disgust.",0
"The initial story line appeared to be sound and could possibly be interesting. But the author's treatment of the characters and twisted scenarios left me cold and disgusted. I never actually got to book five, having given up and abandoned the story on book two. There are good sword and sorcery tales out there but this is not one as far as I am concerned.",0
"This was the first and last Robinson book I read. Too many geographical details- the characters were unsympathetic and the story line lacked creativity. I guess I should have read one of the other colored Mars first. However, I thank Robinson from sparing me from the desire to read any more of them- my time on Earth is limited. If I were you, your time on Mars should be limited, too. This was also the last science fiction genre that I read- it made me realize that it's not for me, and for that, I also thank the author.",0
"I am an ardent student of history and particularly enjoy English and Scottish history from the period 1300-1750.  The author of this work is one of my favorites, having read most of his Flashman novels of historical fiction.  That being the case, you would think that this work would be right in my wheelhouse.  You would be wrong.Expecting interesting stories and histories of events along the English/Scottish border, I was instead confronted with a dry, turgid scholarly treatise.  Endless citing of English and Scottish village names, multiple variations of spellings and name forms, many times for the same person, illegible maps and a complete lack of any semblance of organization leaves me mystified how on earth this book has garnered so many positive ratings.  Does the author have so many relatives?Most annoying is the author's frequently employed tendency of directly quoting many of the actors in the history.  You would think this would bring an authenticity and clarity to the dialogue, but quite the opposite.  For you see, the denizens of the border didn't exactly speak the King's English as you and I know it.  For a good example, read some Robert Burns and explain to me what it says.  Page after page of quotations whose meaning can only be vaguely discerned by puzzling over context and possible meanings of words spelled only slightly similar to those with which you are familiar.  Loads of enjoyment and enlightenment ensue.This is, quite frankly, one of the worst books I have ever read.",0
"As a history buff and huge fan of Anne Boleyn, this novel made me sick. There is a limit as to how far a novelist can stretch the truth while writing historical fiction, and Gregory went too far. It is clear that Gregory did hardly any research on Anne Boleyn's character (as is evidence by the fact that she did not even consult THE biography on Anne, Eric Ives's book) and instead was too concerned with making Mary Boleyn out to be more important than she actually was to English history. Gregory unfortunately just reiterated the slanders that Anne Boleyn's character incurred after her execution by her Catholic enemies. It is sad that an author today could do so much disrespect to a historical figure in one novel. Furthermore, she cites Retha Warnicke's research as being her primary basis for the novel, yet after Warnicke heard this, she publicly distanced herself from the novel--mainly because Gregory misinterpreted Warnicke's theories completely. In my opinion, Gregory may as well have made up characters and kept the story she wrote, because she completely changes the personalities of these figures as we know them from the years of reasearch done by actual historians. I am all for using creative license to ""fill in the gaps"", but Gregory uses far too much license in this book, and instead changes the facts for her own interest--in order to make Anne appear as the horrible, manipulative sister, while Mary is an innocent victim of Anne's wrath. It is proposterous. For example, Gregory completely ignores Mary's behavior in France before she joined the Tudor court. Historians are pretty certain that she slept with the King of France, as well as others, during her time there. Gregory chooses to believe that Mary is a virgin when she comes to Henry, just to make her appear more innocent. Another example is Anne making Henry Carey her ward. She did this because Mary did not have enough money to give Henry a proper education, so Anne was helping her, and actually did an extremely nice thing by giving him such a good education. Gregory spins this to make it seem like Anne is stealing Henry from Mary--a ridiculous notion and quite the opposite of what actually happened.Besides the switching around of facts, the book isn't even very well written. The characters are very black and white, as is true in most of Gregory's novels (one woman=good, other woman=bad). I would not recommend this book to anyone.. if I could give it a 0 star review, I would have.",0
I love the GoT series but I'm not happy about waiting for the next book. This book went round and round with no real closure. I trudged through it simply to see if I would get some resolution. I did not...,0
"I'm vacationing in Sam Miguel de Allende. It's rainy season. And I thought I'd reward myself with a little Agatha Christie between my more academic reading. What a huge misstep! I'm only have way through, and I thought let me see if others on Amazon have reacted as poorly as I have to this work. They have!So far this dreary novel sidesteps logic, is extremely talky, there is no suspense, and politically it comes off as a right wing attack on youth culture and the anti-war movement. Agatha, you have never disappointed me before, although I did notice a few hints of anti-Semitism ( I can't remember now in which mysteries), but then I thought I must be imagining it.Now I'm at page 151 and am forcing myself to continue because you brought me so much joy in the past. Maybe the rest of this tome (tomb??) will redeem itself. But for those of you who still want to adore Madame Christie, make believe PASSENGER TO FRANKFURT doesn't exist.",0
"I read this book, and ONLY this book out of this series. It was sub-par, so I didn't buy the rest. This book ends like a movie serial. I loved The Unbeliever series, and expected more from The Real Story.I sit here and read reviews of all the Gap books, but the reality is that this one is badly written. Perhaps the series is good, but I will never know because I disliked the writing style, the simplistic story, and the pulp ending of the first installment. If an author writes a bad novel, do they REALLY deserve to get more of your money? In this case, I didn't invest another [dollar] in the rest of the Gap books because the first was not very good. I recommend you do the same.... The Gap gets 2.",0
"After a 5 year wait, A Feast for Crows was a turgid disappointment.  Martin claimed the second half of the book (A Dance With Dragons) was already written and hopefully would be published in a year.  Instead, it was a 6 year wait. (Did that set some sort of record?) I wasn't going to bother reading this book, since there is no way I can recall all the secondary and tertiary characters and story lines, but I was enticed by the great HBO television series and changed my mind.Well, that was a mistake.  A Dance With Dragons is another disappointment.  A frustrating barrage of vaguely familiar names and plot lines caused me to give up about 30% of the way through on Kindle.  I couldn't sleep one night, so I picked up the book again and forced myself to keep reading, and fortunately the story picked up.Aside from all the forgotten characters and plots, the problem is that nothing much of interest happens.  Stories left dangling 6 years ago, and some instances 11 years ago, are still dangling. Of interest, Martin offers up yet another possibility for Jon Snow's true parentage, and shows that maybe some of those characters you thought he gleefully killed off aren't really dead after all.If you gave me a summary of important events in this book, it wouldn't fill up a single page, and I could skip reading this book and wait (or not) for the next book to come out in, what? another year? or 6 years maybe?",0
"I just can't get past chapter 5.  I bought this based on all the reviews.  Sadly, I must move on.  I alsways feel guilty for not finishing a book.  Even time at the beach did not help.",0
"""Partisans"" is one of those disappointing adventure novels that build up a nice head of steam before crashing into a wall.During World War II, a Yugoslavian agent under apparent German command takes a team of compatriots deep into his native country, where Italian, German, and their Cetnik ""allies"" watch each other as suspiciously as they do their Partisans foes. The agent, Petersen, has a message to deliver, though what that message is and who he has to deliver it to is a mystery.What makes ""Partisans"" enjoyable is the leisurely way it begins, with much circuitous banter and some dark doings on darkened city streets and aboard an Italian torpedo boat. You know Petersen can't be working for the Nazis, but what about those with him? Who can he trust? Who can we trust? One settles in expecting a variant of the commando tales MacLean famously presented in such books as ""The Guns Of Navarone"" and ""Where Eagles Dare,"" though laced with a welcome sardonic edge courtesy of Petersen.Agreeing an attempted assassination against them was committed by amateurs, Petersen adds: ""But the effect of an amateur bullet can be just as permanent as a professional one.""Or take his impression of an Italian officer he meets: ""He's reasonable, personable, smiling, open-faced, has a firm handshake and looks you straight in the eye - anyone can tell at once that he's a member of the criminal classes.""As the novel goes on, you begin to realize it isn't going anywhere, that the banter is all you will get. The plot advances only because Petersen and his group keep getting captured by various forces who then leave them unharmed, which Petersen explains is part of his mysterious plan. A rotund pal drinks alcohol by the quart, while another keeps a strange, surly silence. A couple of women along for the trip call Petersen a ""monster,"" then break into tears over such things as having to ride a pony over a mountain.More annoyingly, one never is able to work out what Petersen is up to until the end of the novel, at which point he explains it all to you and his comrades in such a roundabout way none of it makes much sense.Maybe he was having a poke at the au currant thrillers of the time. When ""Partisans"" was published in 1983, MacLean was struggling with a form of novel he helped popularize but which had been picked up by more sophisticated writers like Frederick Forsyth and Ken Follett, who jammed labyrinthine storylines into books twice as large as MacLean's. Of course, MacLean's simpler stories could be quite wonderful, too, but here we are handed a plot so convoluted no one could understand it. Even the flap jacket for the original hardcover describes a story with little resemblance to what's in the book.That's a shame, because ""Partisans"" has the makings of a good tale, with interesting characters and a charged background of multiple, conflicting loyalties running riot in an exotic locale. MacLean throws a lot of plates in the air, and you wonder how he is going to get them all down. Then he surprises you by letting them crash to the floor.",0

"Martin continues his tradition of dragging out plotlines to the point where you want to skip whole chapters to find something significant happening.  His writing skills are excellent, but I've finally realized I don't care for his storytelling.  With so many point-of-view characters it's no wonder that his books crawl.  I have come to believe that he keeps adding characters simply because he runs out of people to kill.I was so disappointed in the ending, after taking so much effort to finish the book, that is the last of his novels I will read.  I am clearing the others out of my library.Read at your own risk and don't expect much in the way of a conclusion.

Obviously, Martin is going for the ""stretching out the series with filler trash a la Robert Jordan show-me-the-money"" angle, and abandoning all pretense of imagination, decent writing and character development. Why do these series have to go on and on if there's nothing worth reading? Amping up the soft porn and vulgar language is the only nod to ""action"" anywhere in this book, maybe a boon to all the lonely nerds camped out in their parents' basements, but not to me.Too many characters discussing nothing, endless repetition of themes (yes, we know Daenerys is unsure, young, and horny.  WHERE ARE THE DRAGONS???  Yes, we know Theron has broken teeth and missing fingers and Ramsay is a sadistic monster.  WHEN IS THE REVENGE??? Yes, we know Jon Snow is young, unsure and being challenged at every turn.  WHEN DOES HE TAKE CHARGE??? Lord Manderly is slovenly, the Lannisters are cruel, Tyrion is the misunderstood Imp, etc, etc) It takes 500+ pages for anything to happen, and it didn't tie up all the unraveling threads of endless characters no one cares about. Creating new characters is no substitute for a good story.Boring boring boring.  A shameful sputtering end to a promising beginning.",0
"This book was easy reading, but was also kind of facile and read like a treatment for a movie script (and I am sure there will be a movie).  I think we were supposed to find crotchety old Jacob lovably cantankerous, but I just thought he was annoying.  The circus story (featuring young Jacob) was much better, but all it has is plot--characters don't really develop, writing is passable but not skilled.",0
". . . with everyone who expressed frustration with too many characters and plotlines.  While I have enjoyed the overall plotline/paradigm/tableau/whatever you want to call it, the buffet of storylines started really getting out of control in the fourth book.  Ironically Martin somewhat addresses this at the end by assuring all will be made clear in DWD.  It didn't take 100 pages to decide that wasn't the case. Hopelessly lost and frustrated, I just ""went with it"", no doubt missing a whole lot because constantly combing through the ""glossary"" at the end of the book every three pages was tedious in the extreme.  Bigger is not always better.",0
"The prologue to this book put me off a little, containing as it did a very descriptive act of violence, but I persevered since someone had recommended this book to me.  Two more very ugly, explicit and disgusting sexualized ""scenes"" in the very early pages had me deleting the whole thing and not reading any further.  I'm told this has been made into a movie, which not only beggars belief, but illustrates why I rarely find a movie these days that is worth watching.",0
"I became a fan after reading the first book in the series. It was not surprising that I devoured the next two and waited anxiously for book number four. Like many others I was very disappointed with A Feast For Crows and was hoping that the author will compensate with this book. The author kept saying that most of the popular characters will be covered in this book so the expectation was even higher.Now after reading this book, I must admit I am not eager to know how this story ends or whether there is going to be another book closing the series. Although the writing style is good as ever, the plot does not advance and the few shocking turns during the plot are undone by simple kids realms solutions where the heroes never die. That is also the reason why the ending, which was quite extreme, did not leave a taste of wanting to find out more since the hunch is that it will be resolved with a turn that will take all the surprise away...Just to convey the level of distrust I now hold I can say that when I read in the previous books that Bran and Rickon were killed, I stopped reading having the saddest feeling I had from a book and I could not stop talking about it with my wife for 2 days. In this book however, when anything like that happened to a character I like very much, I did not feel anything and I just did not care. I only checked the number of the page I was at to know how long more I need to endure this reading.A marvelous series that started in the most promising way, just crashed head on into a concrete wall. A shame.",0
"Maybe it's because I was just coming off reading &quot;Red Dragon,&quot; but I found this story to remind me too much of all the serial killer hype that I see so much of all over the place.It's not that this book was  bad, it just didn't really do it for me. I mainly read it because I enjoyed  the movie &quot;Kiss The Girls&quot; based on the Patterson novel of the  same name. I thought that story was intriguing. This one, just didn't move  me much.",0
This book reads like a romance novel and doesn't have much depth. The characters aren't very well defined and they seem two dimensional.  I've read other much better historical novels than this.,0
"the book in itself has a good story line yet it is too predictible and also has some parts where you just ""get lost"" in it...being from israel also didnt help me understand some of the complex terminology of the book which made the reading a bit more harsh then fun.",0
"A U.S. Senator's daughter is kidnapped from a tony upper-class private school in Washington D.C. Dr. Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman) becomes involved in the case when the perpetrator plants some evidence in his mailbox. Dr. Cross teams up with a beautiful Secret Service agent (Monica Potter) who was working on a security detail at the private school (to look over the welfare of another student -- the son of the Russian President). Together these two crime fighters piece together clues that apparently point to a highly intellectual and challenging criminal oppenent: Gary Soneji (played by Michael Wincott).This movie is being marketed as a kind of prequel to the movie Kiss The Girls, starring Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman -- who played Dr. Cross, a retired forensic detective who is called on a difficult case to track the whereabout of a Congessman's daughter who was kidnapped by a sexual predator. Morgan Freeman also starred as a criminal detective in David Fincher's film Seven (also starring Brad Pitt), and it seems that he has found an acting role that many find appealing -- playing a quiet, extremely thoughtful, criminal profiler, a kind of modern day Sherlock Holmes.That being said, Along Came a Spider looked like a promising thriller, but it turns into an ugly mess in a very short time. Almost every hunch that Dr. Cross ponders turns out to be correct. Almost everytime the kidnapper is cornered, red herrings (something used to confuse the viewer and turn the attention away from the basic issue) are thrown out.As the movie chugs to its ""dramatic"" conclusion, any tension that the director worked to produce in the audience evaporates when it becomes obvious that trust was invested in the wrong person. That's about all that I can say about the surprise ending. Current advertisements for this movie caution those who have seen it to ""not give the ending away."" Yes, this movie has a ""surprise"" ending (although I question that claim) and ostensibly the producers of this film want to lure new viewers into the theater by building extra intrigue into the movie -- ala the famous and long-running London stage play ""Mousetrap"" (Agatha Christie's whodunnit play).",0
I'm done. Jumpy lumpy dumpy dull. All characters blur and bore me now. I give up on the series. Characters now no different from each other.As useless as the Third book in Titus Groan. Gormenghastly.,0
"For a classier historical novel about the Boleyns, I recommend The Lady in the Tower by Jean Plaidy.",0
"For Agatha fanatics only. The plot relies on unconvincing behaviour in Chapter 1. This book reads like a serial for Girls Crystal and I suspect it was written long before Collins Crime Club published it in 1959. The author in 1959 was aged 69 and at the height of her fame. Did she salvage this from early efforts in her Rejects drawer and tack on Poirot in the last 70 pages? That's the impression I get.Nevertheless, the writing is good, the characters fascinating. Subtle copy editing would help. For instance, when a 15-year-old schoolgirl pulls up the leg of her knickers Poirot `ejaculated'. Modern readers please note: older dictionaries restrict the meaning of this word to `exclaim'.One thing nothing can help is the divine inspiration that helps Poirot explain everything using weird twists of logic. But doesn't he always!",0
"I am appalled by how many people thought this was a good book.  If you are looking for fiction, fine, but this book should not be called historical if it is referring to Anne Boleyn. As I read the reviewers who rated this book four or five stars I realized that few of them knew anything at all about Anne Boleyn, Henry the VIII, the Tudor era, or even how to write a decent novel. Many other reviewers have delineated this book's shortcomings (look for Carol's review from August 2004) so I won't go into it all, but there is one thing I do want to say.  If you are a person who has read a  book called  historical fiction, I would caution you against reviewing that book unless you actually know something about the subject.  It makes you - especially the reviewer who said she was a teacher! - look like an idiot.There is nothing historical about this story except in a very broad way. If you want to know the true story and don't want to read real history, then check out the BBC miniseries - ""The Six Wives of Henry VIII"" or the Richard Burton movie - ""Anne of a Thousand Days""",0
"I'm not sure what happened here, but it sure took a long time to happen. I (mostly) loved all of the other books in this series and waited--waited years--for this volume. What a disappointment.If you haven't read the other books in this series, DO NOT start with this book--you won't have a clue. Martin introduces characters one after another, and unless you know them from the earlier books, you'll be left shaking your head. But what really astounded me about this book was the way he introduced several characters and then they seemed to drop off the face of the planet; you never hear from them again. What's up with that?While ""Dragons"" does have its moments, overall this book is a bore--and that's coming from someone who really loves the Fire and Ice series. It's obvious that the whole purpose of this book is to set up a sequel. I always thought that the purpose of a book like this was to entertain. It does that, after a fashion, but not very well.Sadly, I have to wonder if Martin has lost interest in his creation.",0
"This series should have been three good books but ended up five OK books. Seems author spread out the books to make money, but watered down the story in doing so. Books 1,2&3 were good reads, but 4&5 were the worst books that I have read in a long time.  Wish I hadn't read them and stopped at 3.",0
This is one of those series where it just feels like the author grew to hate everything to do with the world he had created and started wantonly slaughtering the main characters with no thought as to how he was going to fill in the gaps that they left in the story.  Between the 5 years it took him to write this and the fact that he is off writing another series of books now I would DEFINITELY advise against buying anything that this author writes until he completely finishes the series or you might just get burned like so many have .  Oh and what was the deal with the so many chapters being dedicated to shallow boring characters that had no influence on the overall story.  It felt to me like they were just there to add extra chapters to an overly long book in a series that will in all likely hood never be finished due to the author dying of old age half way through the 7th book.  That and I don't know about you but I don't fee like waiting another decade for books six and seven to be released.,0
"I assume that people interested in audio versions of O'Brian's novels have already read the books. So, listening to to the book is a supplementary pleasure that can follow a great read. My rating here has nothing to do with the literary quality of the work in question. The whole Aubrey-Maturin series, with its hints of Jane Austin, is superb. But if you want to listen to them I warn you to stay away from any of the versions read by Simon Vance. His are tedious, monotonous readings, in which he is unable to sufficiently differentiate the characters, with their diverse accents from around the world. For example, Maturin grew up in Ireland, and should therefore have a bit of an Irish accent. Vance can't do it.  Rather, he gives us wooden characters that makes Jack sound like a bombastic jerk, and Stephen like a mincing prig. And in his hands, Diana sounds like a silly simpering ninny. An actor, not just a reader is required. I highly recommend Patrick Tull, who recorded the entire series with consistent success and enthusiasm, as well as John Lee, who unfortunately only recorded the first 6 volumes.",0
"Time Magazine needs to take back their statement that GRRM is the ""American Tolkien.""  Tolkien was never this tedious, not even in the Silmarillion (which sorely tested my patience).  Hell, I'd take a book of JRR's lengthy elvish ballads over this dreck any day of the week.I lost patience with this series 2 books ago, but I felt revitalized after watching the superlative HBO series this spring.  I think that made things worse, actually, since Peter Dinklage was so amazing as Tyrion and in this book Tyrion is reduced to drivel.Other reviewers have covered the many problems with this book already, so I won't rehash.  I will say that it is now clear to even the most devoted GRRM fans that he has gotten to full of himself to write a decent book anymore.  He believes his own press and as a result has become a pretentious wind-bag who needs a swift kick in the pants and a fascist editor who will slash his work to the bone.",0
"Rough Justice is little more than an exercise in exaggerated formulaic writing. All of Ms. Scottoline's characters are two dimensional caricatures. The heros are all female. The villains are all male. The situations overreach and are scarcely believable. The interactions between male and female characters are so misandrous that even male children are portrayed as mean spirited, dishonest and corrupt. The primary antagonists are shown to be either murderers, brutes, and  malicious malefactors of one kind or another, or utterly emasculated wimps with nothing better to do than fetch baby formula and cower before the tirades of other overbearing males. I found this book to be shallow, uninteresting and fundamentally bereft of any redeeming value. I would not recommend reading it to anyone, except perhaps those who share Ms. Scottoline's investment in misandry.",0
this is my 4th Sheldon novel and probably the worst after the other side of midnight.  It doesn't compare to his other works like &quot;rage of agels&quot; and &quot;master of the game&quot;,0
"I had never heard of Powell, or his twelve book symphony, until a discussion about the mechanics of the Alexandria Digital Library brought him to light. Although the recommender hadn't listed Powell as something I'd care for, one of the participants in the discussion who knew of First Impressions, thought it might be something up my alley. Based on this first book, I'm afraid that the machine wins.A Question of Upbringing introduces you to the main characters of Powell's magnum opus: the narrator, Jenkins, who one never really gets a handle on because he spends more time describing the others than ever going on about himself; Templar, the womanizer and lay-about; Stringham, privileged and haughty; and Widmerpool, the odd man out, with drive and ambition, but no class. One meets them at boarding school and follows them through college in this first volume, but what happens is never as important as what one thinks is happening. As a narrator, Jenkins is obtuse to the point of frustration, never quite describing the situation, but using plenty of words to not do so. Every time I thought something was going to get interesting, the novel would shift to some other scene.The blurb writers compare Powell to Proust, but I can safely say that A Question of Upbringing is much more interesting than The Remembrance of Things Past. A &quot;comic masterpiece,&quot; though? Not in this first volume. The book I have has the next two in the sequence, and I will likely go ahead and give them a try, but based on the first soiree, I must dance to some other fiddler.",0
The first part of the book acts as the set-up for the second. The first is slow and the description of how the protagonist takes revenge from her enemies is frankly naive. The second part is better but still if it's  supposed to be a thriller it would have to be addressed for early-teeners  not for adults.,0
"Boring. Does not live up to first three books. Does not need the sex as it is not true prono, but limits recommemding to younger readers. Lost train of story, therefore would not recommend.",0
"I could not help but put this book down. I must be fair and note that perhaps I have merely grown out of the insipidity that the fantasy industry thrives on, but disclaimers aside, this series is still terrible. The plot is implausible (and that is truly saying something for a fantasy novel (being inherently implausible)), and the writing is amateurish. Honestly, I was confused when I begin reading this-perhaps I had mistaken the author's name on the cover? Unfortunately, no, but I surmise that this is some of Kay's earliest work, and it is apparent. The Fionavar Tapestry demonstrates none of the laudable elements of Kay's later writing. So, if you're interested in Guy Gavriel Kay, avoid this awful example of writing and check out some of his later books (the Sarantine Mosaic was excellent).",0
"I found myself flipping through numerous pages, because the dialogue was repeated many times, and it was slow and uninteresting.",0
"Books 1-3 were engrossing and broke so many accepted standards for fiction, in a good way. Book 4 was acceptable, but overly long for the actual plot(s) progression. Book 5 barely moves any plot forward and makes me wonder if GRRM has totally given up on the series as a whole. It seems more like he is simply writing to fulfill some publisher's obligation. Mark Twain once wrote a long letter and apologized that he didn't have time to write a short letter. That's how this book feels: GRRM didn't have time to write a a good sequel and ended up just rambling all over the place, including every thought he ever had about the story line. And to think I waited five years for this! I feel totally betrayed by the author.",0
borrowed this book from the kindle library and only had it a day before I ended up returning it....i found the parts that I read pornographic and vulgar...makes me sad for the world and those that AREN'T bothered by such things...guess I should just stick to the young adult novels...*sigh*,0
"I am continually puzzled by the publishing industry's ""prizes.""  This book takes up an astonishing amount of shelf space in book stores.  Cover to cover there is nothing in it.  It is like reading a cut and paste book.  The characters are thin, flavorless, cliched, sleep-inducing.  The same with the dialogue.  I am still trying to determine what the author's purpose was, unless it was to bore us to tears (those would be the only tears shed).  I felt like it was written by an automaton, someone who does not care about the craft of writing but thinks she is precious.  There is no strength to the story or the sentences.  I actually felt insulted by this drivel.Read The Deptford Trilogy, by Robertson Davies.  Now there is a circus story you won't forget.",0
"How people can make these types of mistakes is beyond me. There appears to have been no editor or proofreading before putting this up for sale and apparently no quailty control measures on Amazon's part.

This &#34;book&#34; give a page or two &#34;outline&#34; of a topic.

"Laborious. After the first 100 pages I swore if I had to read another page full of yet more food and/or clothing description I would retch, and retch I did.Repetitive. I believe I read the precise descriptors of a character and of another character's feelings about an event at least three times over. Yes, the same words.Irritating. Old characters are muddled, dumb where they used to be smart, etc. New characters could be interesting but somehow are not. And WHY must I read yet more about Cersei? She was way too much of the last book; I definitely did not want to read more of her.Angering. When even Daenerys becomes aggravating to read, I know I've waited this series out too long.There is something good in all of this: I'm only as annoyed as I am because I loved the characters GRRM created, and I don't like what he's doing with them. However, I didn't think GRRM would - or could! - write anything to make me dislike Daenerys, but I've been proven wrong.",0
"I'm another reader who can't even begin to understand why this book was so popular, or why people rave about Gruen's writing.  I thought the writing was mediocre at best, and that the plot, narration, and dialogue were BORING!

I tried to like this book, and I tried to finish it, but I really couldn't, on either count.",0
"After recently discovering and enjoying the wonderful TV series starring Jonathan Rhys Meyers, I found myself on a bit of a Tudor wave so, looking for good books, I've read ""Wolf Hall"", which was beyond amazing and ""The Other Boleyn Girl"", which was... well... for lack of new words that would have to be invented to describe this ""novel"", I'll have to settle for s-star-star-t.The book is supposed to be about the life and times of Mary Boleyn, the (younger? why not! poetic license and all that) sister of the more famous Anne, and is written in her POV.I could not even finish it, dragging myself through half the pages, until conceding defeat, for even someone only fleetingly familiar with the period, like myself, found some of the goings-on so outrageously invented that I almost wanted to cry out 'no way could this happen!'.The only redeeming value of this piece of.... literature is the easy writing and the sometimes witty and clever lines.Perhaps I have been spoiled by the magnificent historical novels, with real historical characters at the center, I have read previously, like ""Masters of Rome"" series or the Cicero Trilogy or ""Wolf Hall"", but I also have read enough Dumas to recognize when the power of imagination is going just far enough and when it is preposterous.Or perhaps it's just the author's ambition and pretension that got in the way - had she but categorized her book as 'a romance novel taking place in the Renaissance period' or 'a book like those nauseating ones with men dressed like pirates on the cover' or anything else really, but not a 'historical novel'. I personally would not have been tempted to read it then.To sum up, this is nothing more than a glorified self-insert RPF (Real Person Fanfiction) and I would not recommend it to anyone over 15 years old.",0
"i usually find Oscar Wilde's stuff to be delightfully witty and wise. Parts of this were excellent, very much up to his usual standard, but most of this book was pretty forgettable.",0
"I read this about a year ago and can't recall a great deal of the book. From what I do recall it was like a poem all the way through. While the writing was beautiful, I found it ambiguous and befuddled with meaning that I could not identify with. When Gibran speaks of God, I cannot identify because I have since abandoned those philosophies. It is thus difficult to revisit them in this book. I have the feeling a may have missed something great about this book. Indeed, I pulled wisdom from parts, but rather than go back and read it again, for now, perhaps I will move on to another of the many books out there that are enlightening and worth reading. Someday, I would like to read this again and dig deeper.",0
I did not like the book..it moved quickly  in the beginning but slowed to a snails pace after that..I was very angry with the main character and her machinations. ...her lack of honesty her fear of not fitting in with her community and her need to keep her  status quo  marriage alive really bothered me..I am not a member of the ultra orthodox family but I would think that one should be able to tell their husband as well as the police what transpired....being raped is never the females fault..and telling could possibly prevent another heinous act...usually  violent rapists are not one time only felons..her speaking up would never have been a sin  in my eyes but concealing what happened permeated her being as well as all the lives she touched..not a good decision and it does put a very poor light on the orthodox women and their roles  and views on life.,0
"The first three were somewhat tiresome but worth reading for the verisimilitude and feel of being there and involved in the plot and the ACTION. I should have known with volume four to quit while I was (barely) ahead. Now, no action except when the author thinks he has just about put you to sleep. The dwarf's humor has even grown trite and banal. Now there are only words, and words, and words, and even more words, put together in no particularly pleasing order. When he killed off yet another Stark (Snow) in a matter of half a page to no good purpose, I almost threw the book at the wall. You sold us out Mr. Martin; most sagas are supposed to have an aim and an end. You are NOT a Tolkien. You have made your pile of money now please go enjoy it somewhere rather than destroy your reputation and our reading pleasure further. Shame, shame, shame!Seth Aragon",0
"I read this book a while back and I must agree with every 1,2 stars reviewer out there it is Overrated, plain and simple. I know a lot of people are interested in reading this book because of the recent Major Motion Picture starring Rob Pat and Reese Witherspoon.Oh, Well the premise of the story is quite interesting, an almost college graduate who runs away after his parents tragic death (nope this is not a spoiler it's in the back cover) only to join a traveling circus where he goes from a stable boy to the circus vet in a course of (well less than a year), and falls in love with a married showgirl named Marlena who is suffering under her abusive husband August (who is described as being schizophrenia but every psychologist will tell you he's just an aggressive, controlling jerk with anger management problems).So, this book has all the elements possible to make it a good read, Adventure, Romance, Drama, and forbidden love Blah Blah Blah !Adventure, Hardly ! Action (Well apart from the few scenes of hopping in and out of trains there's hardly any to count), Romance & Forbidden love ? (the romance element although seems to sum up a big part of the story even bigger than the circus is so contrived, lacking and unrealistic. The characters hardly hold a conversation to make us believe they belong together, I didn't care if Marlena and Jacob separated for life ! Actually I found myself hoping they would just to spice up the book from its predictable ultimate boring ending and I'm a person who loves happy endings) Circus Life ? Well, Yeah its there all right but the writing doesn't allow it to come to life. I never felt transported to the 193os, I never felt that I was in a circus. The descriptions were unfortunately very flat.The characters are the biggest disappointment in the book. They are two-dimensional at best as well as stereotypical. The Good guys are innocent, nice and bearing all the sufferings of the world on their shoulders and the bad guys are greedy jerks and a$$holes who only care about profit and the $$$ money !Some people were complaining about the Over the top sex scenes, Ahh, O.K ! I'm used to reading romance books heavy on sex scenes and this one doesn't even come close. I don't mind sex in books as long as there is a reason to it and as long as it is beautifully written. In here the characters are just flat out boring that they make sex and murder boring.Obviously none of them is sympathetic even Jacob who just lost his parents, we never get insight into his soul. We never knew for sure why or how was he driven by depression and shock after his parents death to leave all his life behind him and join a circus, we never even know how he recovered from the lost of his parents because he never show any signs of being sad or depressed. Marlena on the other hand, well she is in an abusive relationship so its O.K that she cheats on her husband with Jacob. It would've been rather interesting if her husband was actually a good man but she fell out of love with him and ran away with Jacob leaving the circus. Now that would've been a better conclusion !This book/author does the fatal mistake of telling instead of showing. We are told that this and that happens but we are never shown and therefore never transported. I give it 2 stars for entertainment value and because it was a fairly easy/fast paced book to read. However, other than that maybe I was expecting too much but this book is overhyped and frankly way overrated.",0
Book 4 and 5 are boring...my thought..read Kate Morris's review.  It is an excellent review. The author seems to let his imagination run wild as the story goes..all the characters are jokes now,0
"I just finished book five....it was an epic read, I mean that I made it through. (There are no plot spoilers here.) I'm a big fan of Tolkien, Lewis, Herbert, even Rowling and I was excited to find another author who wrote the BIG fantasy stories.....but I found that unlike those mentioned, there was no nobleness or goodness in any of the characters - unless they were to be killed off or physically maimed in some horrible way. By the end of the book I really didn't care what happened to any of those who are ...still alive or may be alive or at least are not dead.... the plot was so twisted it was difficult to know. I actually had thought of starting a ""family tree"" project to keep track of the characters...... but this is only a book and I'm not planning on spending any more time with them or on future offerings. I am sorry this was not the next BIG fantasy writer I have been looking for.....guess I'll go back to the above mentioned authors and enjoy a read that makes me appreciate the goodness of their humanity.",0
"This series started out wonderful, I loved the 1st two book and the 3rd was ok. This one and the 4th one were terrible. The problem is there are too many characters, too much unnecessary dialogue, and the biggest problem is the plot is moving too slow. At this rate the story wont be nearly finished in book 7. Maybe if books came out every year this wouldnt be a problem, but they only come out every 4 or 5 years. I am really mad bc this series was soo good at the beginning.",0
"This book was just so-so for me.  There was a total disconnect for me with any of the characters specifically between Jacob and Marlena.  I thought their love story lacked passion of any kind.  For me, it felt like the only thing keeping them together was the horses and later Rosie.  It wasn't until half way through the book when Jacob finally admits he's in love with her and it's so lackluster I didn't really believe it.  Perhaps I feel this way because I had just finished reading ""Wurthering Heights"" before this and expecting more passion between the young lovers; however I'm not interested in reading this book again to find out if that's true.......which is saying a lot.  I thought the most interesting part of the book was the Q&A portion at the end where Gruen talks about her research and how all the events that took place on and off the train were based on real events that happened to various circus's during that time.  Knowing that did kind of put those events into prospective, but not really being interested in circus history is where it failed to capture me.  In the end: Big on Circus history, lacking on the love story.  Not one I would recommend unless you like reading and/or learning about the traveling circus.",0
The highly improbable plot and characters were a disappointment.  This was not a fun book!,0
By this book I'm skimming most of it because it's more description description description - for a tv series to make sure the set and costumes look perfect??? Good grief.  There may be closure with some of the stories somewhere but I give up and I'm very sorry I paid for all five books - too bad - book one was great but this has become silly and silly me for not realizing it by book three.,0
"I'm not picky about my books, really! I read airport books! I read mystery novels! But about half-way through, Water for Elephant's 2-dimensional, unrealistic characters' bad soap opera conversations became too tedious and repetitious.  I slogged through, anyway. I was waiting for more elephant plot. But no- Ms. Gruen got even lazier at the end.  Anything and anyone that might have been considered a loose end gets killed off without regret.  ""Mr. Major Character W? We threw him off the train 30 minutes ago. Probably(!!) died. Don't worry about it.""I was disappointed.",0
"I confess that I used to be a consistent reader of Philippa Gregory's works, back in middle school/early high school. As the granddaughter of history professors, I was well aware of her historical inaccuracies but somehow managed to enjoy ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" and a few of her other works. Now that I'm older and wiser, however, I've noticed aspects of this book (not just the historical inaccuracies) that make me cringe.Perhaps the biggest problem I now have with this particular book is the way Mary is portrayed as the good/fair sister and Anne is the evil/dark sister (and not because I'm a brunette myself). The sisters, like the rest of the novel's characters, are shallow, two dimensional, and underdeveloped. Mary is rewarded for no reason beyond being sweet and passive and guileless while Anne is punished for being ruthless and ambitious. This isn't to say that Anne wasn't an ambitious woman; by all accounts she was. But why present this as a bad thing? Ambition does not automatically equal evil. No, not even if the ambitious character is *gasp* a woman. Like I said, Anne was certainly ambitious but she was a real living, breathing woman with her own flaws and strengths, not the evil caricature she was made out to be. I find it very hard to swallow that Henry VIII would have moved heaven and earth to be with the Anne in this novel.It's not just Mary and Anne who are one-note. Katherine of Aragon is saintly and pure beyond belief. Henry VIII is a spoiled child. The Duke of Norfolk and the girls' parents don't give a S*** about them as people, only as pawns for the family ambition. This can be done well if the author executes it well (*cough* George R.R. Martin's Tywin Lannister *cough*) but Gregory does not. As far as we know, the duke and the Boleyns have no goal in life besides pushing Mary and then Anne into the king 's bed. The hell? Jane Parker/Boleyn is a malicious, shrewish gossip. William Stafford is a shining prince of virtue. The men who flock around Anne are basically indistinguishable from one another. The list is endless.I also now find it disturbing that the two sisters have so little agency of their own. As I said above, their uncle the duke and their parents plot to make Mary and Anne the mistresses of King Henry. Neither sister seems to want this for themselves until after it's been decides for them, and then they always do as their uncle or parents tell them. Sometimes they protest but ultimately submit weakly. Maybe this fits Mary's passive character all right, but seems wildly out of character for Anne, in both real life and the novel.And, of course, there are the historical inaccuracies. These bothered me enough as a kid; they're nigh on unbearable now. I know there are spotty patches in history and some liberties need to be taken with historical fiction but a) it is entirely possible to write a good and entertaining story while remaining as historically accurate as possible (well hello there Sharon Kay Penman and Susan Holloway Scott) and b) Tudor England is a pretty well documented period in history, all things considered.Seriously, how much research would it have taken to learn that Mary was actually the elder Boleyn sister? Or that Mary was not, as Gregory claims, a young and naive girl at the time when the novel was set, but notoriously promiscuous (King Francis of France, whose court she and Anne resided at for a time, called her his ""English mare"" because he ""rode her so often"" and she was recalled to England is disgrace because of it)? Or that by all accounts Mary's affair with King Henry was brief and she never enjoyed the privileges of an official royal mistress, and both her children were born after the relationship was over? That last one especially irked me, even as a kid, because it is widely accepted that King Henry's casual dismissal of Mary after he grew bored of her at least partially influenced Anne's decision not to submit to his amorous interests right away. Nor was there any evidence that the Howard/Boleyn family pushed either Mary or Anne into the king 's path. There's no doubt they supported Anne in her bid to be queen and it's likely they would use this to further the family interests, but they never tried to actively whore out Mary or Anne or any of the other Howard girls. Anne was accused of incest, witchcraft, and treason in order for King Henry to be rid of her, but few if any people in her own lifetime, even those who hated her, actually believed the charges. Anne was also known to have been a loving mother to Elizabeth, rather than treating her with indifference or even scorn. A few minor deviations from history are fine, as is filling in the blanks when there's space that needs filling. But ignoring and twisting established historical facts for your own purposes while presenting your books as historically accurate? Completely unacceptable.Lastly, there are little inconsistencies, plus the writing style, that drive me bonkers. George Boleyn was gay (no historical evidence to back that one up, either) yet he slept with his sister? What? Henry VIII was obsessed with getting a male heir yet dumped the younger, fertile sister for the older one? Riiiiiight.Basically, I'm grateful my tastes have improved over the years, especially in terms of historical fiction.",0
"(...) Then there's a quite ridiculous, pretentious ""afterward"" where the author tells of his struggle to achieve ""aesthetic perfection"" with this book and compares himself to Richard Wagner.All of this is made ""profound"" by the author telling us that the victim is really the rescuer and the rescuer is really the villain and the villain is really the victim and hip bone's connected to the thigh bone and the...A piece of depth psychology: ""maybe if I rape somebody often enough, she'll fall in love with me.""

"Actually, come to think of it, my time would have been better spent staring at an hourglass.  This book was a soap opera in print.  The characters were mostly stereotypical, ergo predictable.  I don't think giving the ending away in the prologue was such a great idea, because I spent the next 330+ pages waiting for something (anything!) to happen in that vein.  Instead I found myself wading through pages of the author describing events such as tent raising, etc..  The romantic scenes were very campy.  During the first several chapters when the book's format became aparent, I thought it was very fascinating to have the elder scenes interspersed with the circus scenes.  It turns out that they didn't add much to the story, or even make me want to keep reading.  The writing in the elder scenes was amusing, and soon those chapters became my reward for reading the cirucs chapters.  The ending was perhaps the most aggravating aspect of this book.  Something about Gruen's description of circus life and all its attendant characters makes me think it highly unlikely that a modern-day cirucs manager would embrace a decrepit old man and rescue him from life at the rest home.  Maybe it was all those descriptions of redlighting we were given...I'm not sure.  All said, I enjoyed Gruen's writing style, but I would have enjoyed it much more telling a story with some substance.",0
This series will never end. The first book was was a good read but I think a monkey wrote the last couple. You don't even need to read every chapter - he'll repeat it all in some other chapter anyway.,0
"After finishing a powerful and emotional novel like ""the Kite Runner"" i started to read ""water for elephants"". I am at chapter 8 and i am still hoping that this book will turn out to be better. Its written boring so far and the storyline is not making it any better. I know a lot of people will be shocked bout that comment, but i will continue reading and i hope that it will get better. So far its quite boring to me.UPDATE:Well i did finish this book and i dont know how this book got so many 5 star ratings?????? did i miss something? The whole story was BORING and I really didnt care to much for the main characters. The old man telling the story was a good Idea but at the end it was simply dissapointing.If you didint finish the book yet, then dont continue to read!From the first moment when he met August his wife we all knew what would happen.so that was not surprising at all.After reading and figuring out how august was acting up all the time it was also not hard to figure that he probbably had a mental problem. That was not surprising neither.I really wanted to like this book and i kept my word and finished it in the hope that it will get way better but .... no... this book is OVERRATED!",0
"This novel has been inexplicably compared to Nicholas Monsarrat's post WWII naval classic, ""The Cruel Sea"".  Although a fan of MacLean's I could not get beyond the first 65 pages.",0
"I have yet to fully read Green Mars or Blue Mars, but I am in the process of doing so now.  Speaking of those two books, you definitely need to get them as this book isn't able to stand on it's own without the follow ups.  I would like to say that there were quite alot of good ideas in this book.  The whole terraforming of Mars is the focal point, but also the ideas of revolution aren't far fetched.  After all, the same thing happened with colonies over here due to differing ideologies and the length of time it took to cross the Atlantic.There are two main drawbacks to this book that are pretty big.  First off is the pace.  It can be agonizingly slow almost throughout the entire book.  There was only one or two parts (the book isn't divided in to chapters per se) were I wasn't struggling to stay awake.  If you need something to help you get to sleep at night, read a section or two of this book.  It'll do the trick.  As some other reviewers have noted, a good 100 to 200 pages could have been edited out of this book and that would have helped immensely.  Robinson will describe a scene in 50 pages that could easily be half that or less.My other qualm with this novel is Robinson's grasp on medical ideas.  I fully believe that human life spans will continue to lengthen, even in my own lifetime.  However, I don't think a miracle cure to automatically fix all of your body's problems will ever exist.  That's just too far fetched for me.  Furthermore, do you honestly think some scientist out on Mars with limited resources would design said drug?  I wanted this book to be good, I really did.  I'd have to say it's worth a read once, but it's not a page turner by any stretch of the imagination.  Most people probably won't have the patience to persevere through it, honestly.",0
"This book is sort of a sequel to ""The People of the Wind."" It takes place many years after the first book and doesn't involve any of the same characters. It is a sequel only in that it takes place in the same universe and explores the same alien races.Unfortunately, the dialogue in this book is so poorly written as to make the book unreadable. In fact, I couldn't finish it. I tried but I just had to give up. I'm not sure what effect Anderson was trying to achieve but it didn't work.This is one for the trash bin.",0

"Everyone was talking about it last summer, and my book club decided to read it. I was very disappointed. Characters were not believable, there was too much cruelty to animals and violence here, nobody I really liked except the dwarf, and the back and forth from the young man to the nursing home got very dreary. I skipped a lot of pages because the early part was so boring.",0
This book offers nothing new to those who enjoy Science Fiction. It's so lightweight that it almost defies gravity. The plot is tissue paper thin and the characterisation is very sketchy. It reads like a poor 1950s pulp  novel and the ending is flatter than week old beer. I'm surprised that  Dondaldson managed to pad this material out to a thin book. For good space  opera see early Niven or Haldeman.,0
"I kept reading because I rarely leave books unread. The concept was interesting but the writing just didn't grab me. Towards the end, I couldn't suspend my disbelief. I was left unsatisfied. I didn't really feel for the characters in the book. The setting was very well-developed. I do admit that curiosity did keep me going to a point despite the writing style and lack of connection with the characters but toward the end, I was just reading to get done.",0
"I put off writing this review for a while.  I could not make it through this book. This book and ""A Feast for Crows"" have convinced me that Martin has totally lost control of the plot of this series.  There are far too many unresolved, pointless plot lines and characters.  At this point, it seems that Martin is including random thoughts into the story without any consideration of how they advance the plot.  I've given up on this series and would not recommend it to anyone.  Hard core fans will disagree, but there are far better books to read.",0
"This book begins with a very inspiring and thought provoking speech by one of the most influential characters in the book (John Boone). After reading it I thought I was in for a great read, however from then on the book descends into a monotonous long winded story of some astronouts gradually growing old on Mars. Literally nothing happens for about 300 pages, until some revolution occurs at the end of the book.Some of the things in the book that annoyed me the most were:-The fact that the majority of the people on Mars are potrayed as mindless followers that absolutely revere the old crusty ""first 100"" colonists.-Bedouins and Sufis on Mars? Come on! Get real!-If you are not an expert on space colonization you will have trouble grasping where the protagonists are, are they inside or outside? Technical names for equipment and habitations are used without being explained, what is a ""mohole""? what is a ""walker""? what is a ""tent""? (as it applies to space habitation)??-The lack of imagination for place names - ""underhill"" and ""Sheffield"" are a couple of examples of unimaginitive names for the new planet's cities.The book had about 3 or 4 moments that I enjoyed, but the rest of it was so boring!",0
"The opening chapters promised much, from the genuinely chilling prologue to the delightful introduction of Barth Crane - the junior associate of the far from reputable lawyers known cynically as ""Lie and Get 'em off"".My anticipation grew as Crane arrives at the vaguely unsettling location of Murdoch and meets some bizarre (and well depicted) characters. But then, by about a third of the way through, I found this book really began to drag. What revelations there were felt decidedly underwhelming. The supernatural sub-plot was very understated - almost as if it could be put down to Crane's sleep deprevation and drugs abuse. Whilst this ambiguity could have been a major advantage if handled subtly, in Pyper's hands however it merely comes over as a rather wishy-washy loss of direction.  The courtroom scenes are adequately, if uninspiringly, described, and the twist, if indeed it were intended as such, is eminently guessable and left me feeling rather unfulfilled.Lost Girls falls uncomfortably between two stools. It probably has insufficient gritty authenticity to satisfy readers of legal dramas and whodunnits, and certainly contains not enough shocks and chills for devotees of the ghost/horror genre.I'm sorry I cannot be more generous about Lost Girls. The author clearly has considerable talent and often employs startling and delightful imagery, but the overall impact of the novel on me was rather akin to a wet grey mush (which perhaps was Pyper's intention?)....",0
"As I have stated before, one of my MANY quirks is that I must read a book before I watch the movie. When I read in Entertainment Weekly the Reese Witherspoon and Robert Pattison would be starring in the film adaptation of Water for Elephants, I knew that I had to pick it up. I rarely pay full price for a book. However, this one had such rave reviews that I couldn't help myself. Still, it sat on my bookcase until this week when I promised to read it before the opening of the movie. Honestly, I was greatly disappointed.Sara Gruen tells the story of Jacob Jankowski who is so distraught after his parents' deaths that he runs away with the circus. He leaves between his education at Cornell University and his future as a veterinarian. Fortunately, his study of veterinary medicine helps him land a job as the circus' vet. While touring with the circus he meets a number of characters from a red haired midget clown, to an old circus worker who is struck with ""jake walk"" (a condition brought on by drinking tainted whiskey). Jacob soon discovers that life on the road is beyond trying. When an elephant is brought on as part of the show, Jacob finds himself torn between his job as a compassionate vet and the rules of the circus. This causes Jacob to bump heads with his boss, August, who is beyond temperamental and at times masochistic. To complicate matters, Jacob is in love with the lead actress of the show, Malena, who just happens to be August's wife.While the subject matter of the circus would seem to be incredibly interesting, this novel was boring from start to finish. The entire plot was cliched, the relationships were shallow, and the characters were without depth. From the first chapter, I knew the exact path that the novel was going to take. Every time I thought to put the book down, I convinced myself to give it one more chance. It was after all a bestseller, therefore, I thought it would get better. It never did. If anything, it got worse as every cliche was reinforced. The only twist came at the very end and was so absurd I had to re-read the last few pages three times over to make sure that I read it correctly. A book is only as good as its character development but in this novel there is no development. Though Jacob attempts to mature, he can't seem to figure out what his priorities are. Incidentally, neither can Gruen for she has Jacob bemoan his conflicting emotions between his love for Marlena and his feelings towards animal abuse. Fortunately for Jacob, the animals take their fate into their own hands which relieves Jacob of having to develop. I hope, for the box office's sake, that the movie fails to resemble the book. Either way, I will not be the first in line at the theater.",0

"Competent enough writing, but a  story for testosterone-oozing teenagers, not adults. At least three different potential novels here, without any one of them developed sufficiently.Tom Clancy was never exactly an artist, but this reads like an assembly of various notes he had for different stories thrown together into one bloated book. Very difficult to finish.",0
"Awkward cadence, lacks the usual old school Berenstain Bear charm (I despise the newer preachy books but expected this one to be up there with the great The Bear's Picnic.) The illustrations might be worth half a star but it's truly so dreadful I can't bring myself to go over a single star.",0
"This book intrigued me because it is not something I'd normally be interested in reading. I was expecting to be ""moved""--as so many reviewers had indicated. Instead, I was only ""moved"" to flip the pages as quickly as possible to at least come to the surprise ending that was indicated in some reviews.The premise, the whole idea of a story set in a circus backdrop during the Depression, was fantastic. The story itself, in my opinion, failed. It failed for several reasons. The characters appeared to be no more than pawns for moving the story forward--they never made it beyond the cardboard cliche stage. Even Jacob, whose latter years were more endearing to read, was always seen from afar. We never really got in his head at all. He was totally unbelievable. Kid drops out of vet school and joins the circus and acts like a thirteen year old with thirteen year old dialogue.Which brings me to the dialogue in this book. Horrible! I caught myself laughing out loud, in disbelief at the cheezy sentences. And at one point I thought if I read ""uh"" or ""um"" one more time I was going to scream and toss the book in the trash.All that aside, if it was meant to be just a gaudy quick genre-type read, then it wasn't marketed that way. No one ever rose above the surface level, and I simply didn't buy it--the narrator, the girl, the speech during that era.The ending, well, it was okay. It meshed with the rest of the book.And Jacob, he seemed terribly stupid and sophomoric to be a lifetime vet who'd attended Cornell, etc. He was also grouchy and not likable, except when he finally got real about himself growing old. In fact, I came across this passage in ch. 16, ""...my brain is like a universe whose gases get thinner and thinner at the edges..."" I thought YES!! This is what the story is really about: a man who once had keen senses and awareness, and traveled with a circus of all things, has come to the end of the ""show"" and he is facing it and fearing it simultaneously. That was the story Gruen could've warmed my heart with instead of the basic, shallow, ridiculous story in Water for Elephants.",0
"The book is extremely well written.  The descriptions are so vivid, you can almost smell the hay.  But it is filled with violence, vulgar language and sex which I guess is realistic considering the setting.  I read a few chapters but could not continue.  Returned it to the library.",0
Love this movie with Charles Bronson and Jill Ireland. So reading the book. Not bad.  Still like Louis Lamour and Zane Grey better.  This is a good story.,0
"With over 1400 other reviews, I don't see much point in being long-winded. If only Martin felt the same. Another 1000 pages and nothing really happens. Too many characters, too little movement, too little resolution, too little action, and I find that I've really stopped caring. I'm actually only 2/3 of the way through the book, and I'm not sure I'll bother finishing.That's sad. The first 3 were so good....",0
"I'm not sure what to make of this book.  The juxtaposition of the northern  Ontario locals and the ""summer folk"" rings true enough - but all in a  vacuous, ethereal setting and tone.  Is it Erle Stanley Gardner?  Stephen  King?  Mary Higgins Clark?  Dashiell Hammett? Hunter S. Thompson?  It's all  that and less.  (I hate it when reviewers divulge plots - and I won't  burden you with it here.)I'm going back to the more solid ""meat and  potatoes"" (or is that corned beef &amp; cabbage) of Father Greeley's  Chicago.",0
"Many reviewers have commented on the fact that Clancy is using Jack Ryan as his voice to put forth his own view of America.  The evil press, the ugly politions, trying to do good only gets you screwed, ...  You get the picture.  What I'm suprised at is that his misogynic tendencies don't get more press.In this book, the Indian Prime Minister is a manipulative schemer.  The women secret service agents guarding the president's children turn out to be little more than clay pigeons and even the woman head of the president's protection detail does little more than marry one of the male heros of this book.  This carries on a trend he established in his earlier books (was it in ""Sum of All Fears"" that Ryan's female White House antagonist totally crumbled under pressure?) and does little to flatter Mr. Clancy.Recently, we've been seeing too much Clancy and not enough entertaining fiction in his books.  Perhaps he's got writer's block or maybe it's just that he's on autopilot but his last 3 or 4 novels have been major disappointments.  If you've never read Clancy, read ""Hunt for Red October"" and see what he's really capable of.  If you read this clunker, you may never be persuaded to read his good books.",0
"I gave three descriptions in my title, that say it all, but the first two speak the loudest - this book is repetitive and boring.  The train rolls in, the train rolls out; in the old folk's facility Jacob is nothing but cranky and rude over and over again.  I truly don't understand how this book was picked up for publication.  I can more easily understand that it was made into a movie (even though I haven't seen it and after reading the book I probably won't), as I can imagine it is truly a spectacle with all of the color and magic of a circus.  And I will agree with other reviewers that it is well researched and the author does a good job portraying the post-depression times.  But that alone just doesn't carry the rest of the storyline, which is shallow and trite.  Among so many unaddressed issues - how is it that Jacob, an ivy league-educated young man, never looks back at what his life might have been after joining the low-lifes (mostly hobos, plus the entertainers) the circus attracts?  Certainly it's not to care for the animals, as you see him doing very little of that in the book.  At the end he wants to ""run away"" from the old folk's home and return to the only life he'd ever known - no surprise there - but it's a ridiculous proposition due to his age and I can't imagine anyone in the circus inviting him.  If you get nothing else from Uncle Al's character it is that he or any man in his position would be ruthless and cut loose anyone who didn't pull their weight, so what would a 90+ year old man do?  Certainly not water the elephants.",0
"Clearly Martin has lost the passion for this story.  Actually found myself skimming pages to get to the next part, and I'm a patient reader ....  What a shame.  I don't think one can be the ""American Tolkien"" without actually finishing the tale, and with this book I'm feeling like the tale may never be finished ... this installment seems to have been sheer drudgery for Martin to write.  The earlier books let you feel like you were there ... the scenes in this one seem more like sketches with shorthand references thrown in.",0
"Here are my problems with this book:1) Remove the sex and animal cruelty scenes, and it reads like a script from a bad Disney movie.2) The main character is shallow and throughout the book I had no idea what made him do the things he did. Why did he join the circus in the first place? Not once did he mention missing his dead parents, his home, school etc. Didn't he have any memories from his childhood, no worries about the future, no relatives, no friends? You never knew what he was about to do next, because his motives, thoughts and emotions were never dealt with, and that's probably because the writer had absolutely no idea how to do that properly.3) I get the feeling that some people liked this book simply because it was so easy to read even Bobo the monkey would get it, since it lacked any depth or complication in the script or the characters. Readers who rate this kind of books with 5 stars have obviously no idea what real literature is.4) The dialogue was poor, and so blatantly contemporary that it made me angry at the writer's lazyness of doing her research properly.5) It was so obvious that the writer was a woman that you could not get it out of your mind even for a minute.6) I'm no prude, but I'm sure images of the masturbating dwarf will be haunting me for a long time.7) Trust a good old disaster/great accident to get rid of the bad guys for you. That way you don't get to kill them yourself and become (gasp!) a bad guy yourself. I would be curious to see how the main character would get out of all that mess if the stampede had not happened.8) If you owned a circus and half a brain, would you hire a 90 year old cripple whith serious health problems who ran away from a nursing home and whom you have just met? Yeah, I didn't think so.9) I can't really recall the sex scenes, which means they we probably not as graphic as some readers suggest, and as for the animal cruelty parts of the novel, yes, they were (theoretically) gruesome but failed to disturb me or make a real impression on me because they were simply not convincing or believable, as was the rest of the book.",0
"Jean Plaidy's dozens of novels written in the third person are among the very best historical fiction to be found, but these first-person novels in her Queens of England series that she wrote toward the end of her life really are pathetic.And, in this case, out of date. Plaidy's other novel about Katherine Howard,Murder Most Royal: The Story of Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard, was published in 1949, more than a decade before the publication of Lacey Baldwin Smith's ground-breaking study of Katherine,A Tudor tragedy;: The life and times of Catherine Howard. Murder Most Royal therefore re-hashed, through no fault on the author's part, subsequently discredited theories, e.g. that Katherine and Thomas Culpeper were first cousins (according to Smith's researches they were only sixth cousins), that they were childhood sweethearts and that Katherine, in her scaffold speech, said, ""I die a queen, but I would rather die the wife of Thomas Culpeper"". One might think that someone who wrote so many historical novels and whose bibliographies are littered with history books would have stumbled across A Tudor Tragedy by 1993, when The Rose Without a Thorn was published (incidentally, the same year that Plaidy died).Apparently not. Smith's study is not listed in the bibliography. Neither are the books about Henry VIII's six wives by Alison Weir and Antonia Fraser, published in 1991 and 1992. And so The Rose Without a Thorn re-hashes all those old stories about Katherine Howard that had been discredited thirty years earlier. Plaidy has Katherine giving the scaffold speech ""I die a Queen, but I would rather die the wife of Thomas Culpeper"". Katherine and Culpeper are portrayed as close cousins. Katherine is portrayed as being about eighteen years old when she went to Court, when according to modern research she may have been as young as fifteen, and as going to Court after Anne of Cleves was already queen, instead of arriving there in time to be a maid of honour when Anne arrived. Katherine is also portrayed as saying, at the time of her arrest and interrogation, ""I knew little of the ways of the world. I believed myself betrothed to Francis Derham and that that meant we could behave as husband and wife"" when, as Smith shows, Katherine vehemently denied that she had ever been betrothed to her former lover Francis Dereham, even though admitting to such a pre-contract could potentially have saved her life (by denying it the councillors dug deeper, and found out about her much more serious dealings with Thomas Culpeper after her marriage, leading to her being attainted for treason and executed). And, bizarrely, the Dowager Duchess of Norfolk is portrayed as being Katherine's actual grandmother rather than her step-grandmother - her late grandfather's second wife - even though Plaidy got this correct in Murder Most Royal.The Rose Without a Thorn is not a complete travesty of historical fiction - technically the writing are storytelling are competent. But they're both superficial and, of course, the content is out of date. If you've read a fair amount about Henry VIII's six wives and are looking for an accurate depiction of events then it's probably best not to bother with this book, since its mistakes and discredited theories will irritate you. If wonderful storytelling is all you're after then it would be better to read Murder Most Royal.",0
"There's an interesting premise, a potentially fascinating set of characters, and a grisly set of deaths all based in an atmospheric town.  It should have been a good read.  And, it almost was.  But...The  atmosphere and foreshadowing overwhelm the characters and the story.  The  tension and the mood is laid in so heavy-handed a manner that it's  distracting.  It became a chore to plow through this novel to make it to  the end (though I did, for whatever reason...).  The few 'mysteries' were  incredibly predictable.  The descriptions were so dense that it was tough  to remember what happening in the story, and the caricaturization was so  distracting that it was impossible to care at all for the characters.",0
Get an editor! Finish the story! Is that really so hard? Review the first 3 books and make the next one like those!!!!!!AAAAAArgh!,0
"I know Christie was pretty old when she wrote this book, so it pains me to be so negative, but her age really does show.  The story isn't interesting, the mystery isn't mysterious and the characters are paper-thin -- even Poirot seems like a shadow of his usual self.  The exception is Ariadne Oliver, who gets a remarkable amount of development for someone who ostensibly is just a side character.  This is her final appearance in a Poirot mystery, and she gets an excellent send-off.  The same cannot be said for Poirot.  This is the final Poirot novel that Christie wrote, though not the final one that was published, since she wrote his real finale years earlier and set it aside to be published after her death.  I haven't read it yet because I cannot bear to, so I'm saving it to be the last new Christie book I ever read.  I just hope it's superior to this one!In this one, Poirot and Mrs. Oliver are trying to figure out what happened to the parents of one of Mrs. Oliver's god children.  They were found shot to death in the woods, but what happened?  Did the father shoot the mother or vice versa?  Was it a suicide pact?  Mrs. Oliver is asked to investigate by a woman she meets at a luncheon, then proceeds to go about interviewing a lot of people she hasn't seen in many years, to ask questions about what was happening in the family, to try and put the pieces together with Poirot, who is busy talking to the police.  It's quite similar toFive Little Pigs (Also published as Murder In Retrospect), another Poirot murder in retrospect.  The difference is that you'll be able to spot the solution to this one miles off, as I was.  I can now say that about only three of her books (Peril at End House: A Hercule Poirot Mystery (Agatha Christie Collection)andThe Mirror Crack'd (Miss Marple Mysteries)being the other two) and sadly, it doesn't make for a very interesting read.  More annoying still is that in this book, a character writes to Poirot and tells him that in order to solve the mystery, he should find and interview person X, because she might be able to help them with the truth.  And so after pages and pages of wasted time, Poirot finds and interviews X, and she KNOWS THE ENTIRE EXPLANATION TO THE MYSTERY.  She is flown to England, she tells her story and then the mystery is solved.  So tell me again why Poirot and Mrs. Oliver were even needed?!  That guy could've talked to this character himself anytime he liked!  Christie also employs a method I've seen her resort to in just one other book -- she has Poirot, the master detective . . . hire a detective!  In lieu of actually writing plot development, she settles for pages of exposition as a man shows up and tells Poirot all the details he needs to know about a specific character.  And she later turns out to have no bearing on the mystery whatsoever, so the entire interlude was a colossal waste of time.  Normally I'd decry this as a lazy author's way to get out of writing an additional chapter of action, but in Christie's case I'm charitable enough to substitute the word ""lazy"" with the word ""elderly,"" which makes the choice understandable if not forgivable.On the whole, I have to admit that I wouldn't even recommend this book to a die-hard Christie fan.  But if you're dead set and determined to read everything she ever wrote, then go for it.  I am too, so I can sympathize.  Just be prepared to be bored and let down big time by this one.  It's just not up to Christie's usual standards.  Luckily, she wrote enough phenomenal, classic stories to be sure that her legacy would remain in tact regardless of what she published, and all Christie newbies can rest assured: it gets a heck of a lot better than this.",0
"I couldn't finish the book I was so bored and I HATE leaving books unfinished. I didn't like the crudeness of it either, I just don't see why it was such a hit...... blah!",0
"This was a frustrating, truly awful book. While it started off interesting (a boy's parents dies and leave him nothing, and he gets caught up with a circus), it quickly became transparent and painful. He ""falls in love"" with a girl he hardly speaks to, who is married. He reacts when he should hold back and holds back when he should act. And there are far too many random, explicit, and unnecessary sex scenes. Perhaps if the author spent less time on graphic sex and more time on character development, this book would have been more tolerable. And the ending, which I was hoping would earn the book some redemption, was terribly disappointing and infuriating.My faith in the NY Times bestseller list has been ruined.",0
"I, like everyone else, waited along time for this book. what a waste. I felt like it was a robert jordon book, where everyone traveled everywhere but noone did anything. I kept waiting and waiting for it to get better but it didn't. Reek's character was great, Asha interesting, but the rest...... he just left blowing in the wind. excuse, blowing on the ships or in some far off kingdom.  Take us down mainstreet and get to the meat of it already!!!",0
"**Spoiler Alert**It is one thing to intermittently kill off a protagonist to keep the narrative, and by extension the reader, honest; It is quite another to systematically kill off every sympathetic character in the series to the point the reader honestly no longer cares what happens. The latter is where I find myself at this point, there is exactly one character left that I am invested in, and it is a peripheral character. Every other character I have become invested in over the years is dead. I suppose I could contrive empathy for another character, but why bother? It has already exceeded ""fool me twice shame on me"" and I'm done giving Martin the benefit of the doubt.There is simply no suitable conclusion to Jon's story at this point. Either he really is dead and his entire arc was a superfluous waste of time, or he is revived by some miracle resurrection which by now has become a cliche of the series. Furthermore, the nascent ubiquity of such miracle resurrections has destroyed the atmosphere of the series by embracing the very fantasy tropes Martin once openly flouted.There was a time when a pivotal character dying added to the suspense of the series by letting you know no character was safe. By this point, however, the same trick has been pulled so many times as to make the reader numb to any empathy for any character. Thus does the series become an exercise in nihilism without relevance, context, or discourse.",0
"Very Long, very boring, none of the characers are likeable. I read this one after finishing the Tawny Fool Trilogy expecting to be as good. Boy was I dissappointed. I can't believe I read the who thing.",0
"The premise of the series is great as are the first 4 books, but the 5th was a lot of redundancy with sparse dialogue and rambling descriptions of every meal, random character and environ. When I got to 85% and there was no resolution in sight, I was disappointed to say the least. It appears the author is milking this story for all it's worth. Way too many characters and even more seem to pop up at random. Too many twists to the point of chaos and the characters seem to be all over the planet. There is no sense of time passage or continuity to the flow of events. Also it seems that everyone`s dreams have to be included in the storyline at some point. I will probably read book 6 but if it's more off the same and doesn't end, I'm done.",0
"I have been reading through this book and while it says some true things, it seems very judgmental, especially in the section about games people play.  I also thought it was meant to be written by a Christian, but in the section on Rationalization, it says ""Choosing evil as evil is also a psychological impossibility, because the will can only choose the good"".  I believe that is entirely untrue.",0
"At about 900 reviews to date of A Dance With Dragons I doubt my humble review will either encourage or discourage anyone from reading this book.  However, I feel the need to throw my hat into the ring.I HAVE read and reread the previous 4 books in this series.  This will come as no surprise but I thoroughly enjoyed the first 3 books.  In fact as a reader of fantasy, I felt Mr. Martin brought a whole new dimension to the genre.  He had a way of making us look at people and their motivations in a whole new light - I always felt that there was a bitter truth to his writing - that even though it was fantasy it was very much real - yes there are people who are truly good and are not motivated by selfish interests, but by the interest and betterment of others - but there are many who are selfish, willing to win at all costs, and will do anything no matter how ugly to achieve their goals.  IMHO no one could write those kinds of characters and situations like GRRM.  Sadly, in A Feast for Crows that began to change (I believe I gave that book 3 stars with a wait a see about what was supposed to be forthcoming A Dance With Dragons.Forward to 2011 and A Dance With Dragons has arrived.  Unfortunately, I found it to be a major disappointment.  It has a even slower pace (who would have thought that possible) than AFfC and my most beloved characters have taken a giant leap backward in their personal development.  To all the 5 star reviewers I respect that it  is a matter of personal opinion.  I wish I could have loved this book as much as many of you do, unfortunately, I do not.  Why?  Well here are several of my reasons:Possible Spoilers (I don't think so, but .....)Tyrion:  probably my favorite surviving character up to this point (others I cared about had already fallen by the wayside unless strangly resurrected in this book - I am not even going to go there . . .).  He has always been a strong character, great at plotting and schemes, surviving against overwhelming odds by the use of his wit - now he is a pale reflection of that character, whiney, playing a fool - and if I had to hear ""where do whore's go"" one more time I was going to scream.Daenerys:  A woman who has overcome unbelieveable odds, virtually coming through the fire, crossing deserts, raising an army, hatching dragons, intent on her purpose to return to Westeros and reclaim the throne she feels was stolen from her family has become an ineffectual, sex starved, wanna-be queen.  The way she has turned on her dragons is so off character that it doesn't make sense to me and also the fact that she can no longer make a decision.Pacing - by the end of the book many of our characters never made it to their destination nor were there many plot resolutions.  Since AG of T we have been ""teased"" about the Others - yet what more do we know about them?  Poor editing.  Introduction of too many new characters and too much detail in this book on minor characters.I could drone on (like the book) but what is the point.  Personally I am done with the series.  My ending goes something like this:""Others cross the wall,take over all of Westeros,  turn everyone into other ""Others"" - sail to all of the other kingdoms and zombie them also - then they all live happily ever after.""",0
"Clearly I was unhappy with this book since I'm only giving it 1 star, so let me start with the one thing good I can say about this.  The author does very good prose and character development.  The problem with this book is essentially one of focus.  For example, the first remotely exciting thing to happen is an assassination.  However, rather than actually writing about the assassination one chapter ends with ""John Doe"" giving a rousing political speech and the next chapter begins with ""In the two weeks since ""John Doe's"" assassination . . .  Similarly at one point a war breaks out but the actual war is barely written about- instead we are told of the exploits of someone running around fixing what she can while the war takes place elsewhere.This book begins with the first 100 permanent Mars settlers on a ship on their way to Mars about 30 years in the future- which is why it is science fiction.  However, we are then told in excruciating detail about the political debates between crew and how junior high dating practices are common place on board.  I toughed it out through this whole book in the hope it would get better but it didn't and it commits one of the major sins of the genre:  Rather then setting out to write a good book the author sets out to write a trilogy and so this book ends a cliff hanger- although cliff hanger is relative term.  This book avoids anything resembling action or intrigue so here ""cliff hanger"" means just when I could believe the story was getting to an interesting part it ends.So, in short, this book avoids action, intrigue and adventure in favor of fictional politics, including legal debates.  (If you want to learn more about the legal status of antartica and the author thinks it will relate to Mars then you should read this book.)  I wish I would have been warned away so I wouldn't have wasted my time.  As it is I certainly will not be reading the next two books in this series.",0
"As a Thomas Covenant and a SF fan, I picked this book up to see what Donaldson had to offer this genre.  Frankly, the first word that comes to my mind when writing this is ""open sewer"".  A well-crafted sewer, but one nonetheless.What is most vivid and overwhelming for me in my memory of this book the depravity and sickness at the root of the character-driven conflict.  One main character is Angus Thermopyle, a space pirate who captures, enslaves, brutally rapes and humiliates the book's female protagonist, Morn Hyland.  Regrettably, this is not a briefly-noted backstory.  Morn's struggle to survive life in Angus's hands is a substantial portion of the book, with each subsequent degradation described in sick detail by Donaldson.While I am thoroughly familiar with the concept of an anti-hero and ""realistic"" ""gritty"" fiction, this book crossed my personal line.  While it has more redeeming value than, say, a Tom Green movie (the structure is nicely done, characterization is vivid), I feel like I am already familiar with the depths of depravity to which humans can descend.  I'm willing to traverse those depths if the payoff is great art, but this book doesn't reach high enough to justify getting my mind dirty.  There are better ways to spend your limited reading time.",0
"I stopped reading Robert Jordan after the sixth book, and I really don't want to do the same with this series.  I'm still planning on reading the next books (how many will there be, George?) but Martin is falling into the Jordan-esque trap of writing longer and longer books in which less and less happens.Despite huge armies amassing, this book contains no battles.  A few plans are thwarted, no goals are truly accomplished, and we don't get detectably closer to the anticipated big showdowns (Dany's dragons returning to conquer Westeros and the fight with the Others at the Wall).  There are lots of feasts and descriptions of food.  Lots of grisly death.  Lots of petty posturing, sellswords changing sides, Tyrion bumbling and plotting and playing cyvasse.Bran finally reaches his three-eyed crow and learns to see the world through the network of weirwoods with faces, but just when that gets interesting, about halfway through the book, there are no more Bran chapters.  We don't learn anything more about the mysteries of the Wall, the Others, or the Red God and his priests' ability to see the future.Cersei is shamed but accomplishes nothing important.  Jaime travels a few miles.  Arya has some entertaining adventures that fail to reinsert her into any of the major plotlines.  Nothing interesting happens in Dorne.  The events in the epilogue are not at all unexpected and fail to inspire me to pick up the next book.Martin is often compared to Tolkien, and indeed they are both talented writers who have created epic stories set in large, diverse, and believable worlds.  However, I enjoyed Tolkien much more, and here's why.1.  Tolkien offers a grand historical perspective and a believable basis for the magic in his books.  Martin provides empty history and (so far at least) fails to explain any of the magic or mysteries in his books.2.  Tolkien provides a clear distinction between good and evil, to the point that some consider it a fault.  Martin's world has more shades of gray.  That could be a good thing, but he needs to stop killing all of the honorable characters and letting all the bad ones live.3.  Tolkien sets a clear final goal (destroying the ring) and continues to progress toward that goal throughout the three books while telling interesting and entertaining stories along the way.  He splits plotlines and rejoins them, returning to just two by the end.  With Martin's books, progress toward the final battles has stagnated to the point where there is no detectable forward motion, and we are at five books already.George is a great writer with a knack for keeping the reader engaged with humor, unpredictable turns of events, and cliffhanger chapter endings.  However, in the interest of keeping the story going and eventually reaching a conclusion, he needs to move things along, draw plotlines back together, and refrain from introducing new plotlines for a while.  It may be that he has these things planned out already, but if the pace doesn't accelerate a bit in the next book he may well lose me as a reader.",0
"The difficulty of writing a book that is a ""good read"" is that it must sweep you up and make you forget the world around you. You must become so invested in the daily life and fate of the characters that you become more interested in what is happening on the page than what is going on in your life. At its sporadic best, this novel is a good read. The author has chosen an interesting world and time to write about and obviously done her homework. But homework is not enough. The great nagging problems however are she is neither a good nor original writer. Consequently the characters she has created are wooden and every third sentence out of their mouths is either predictable or a howling cliche. The characters themselves are comprised of one cliche after the other-- the good hearted innocent hero, the evil boss, the plucky sidekick (a dwarf, no less),the bewitching damsel in distress, the schizo villain who is mean to animals... You've seen them all too many times before in books, movies, even cartoons. So when they meet their fates you shrug because you guessed what would happen to each of them fifty pages(or more) before. The book's huge success is similar to the success of a McDonald's hamburger-- you know what you're going to get as you walk into the place.",0
"So far there is no dancing going on. All the characters have become ones with no brain and not a thought before the stupidity. I have this book on kindle and have fast forwarded chapter after chapter. He writes about characters that I could give a flying flip for and only writes a little about whom I would think was the main characters. What is sad it has ruined the series on HBO for me as well. Why kill off so many of the main characters? Who cares what color every single person is wearing, or every detail of all their ancestors? It's liking reading history books in school except I paid for the book. Man and all the very detailed facts of the tortures. I wont be buying anymore of the books in this series, what would the point be? I think he got high and kinda wondered off.",0
I really wish publishers would rate books like they do movies.  I got to the porn part and once again threw another book in the trash unfinished.  Problem is these books are good and the authors don't need to put the trashy parts in - they choose to.  Garbage in - Garbage out.  Guard your heart and your mind don't buy this book. Buy something else or wait for the PG version.,0
"I decided to read this book because I was really interested in seeing the movie. I did not know much about the history of the Tudors nor Anne Boleyn. But I could tell right away by reading this book that the author, Philippa Gregory is extremely biased towards Anne Boleyn. She's turned her book into a critique of how women, such as Anne, who are struck by ambition into some kind of incestuous monster who is ready to push anyone out of her way. To me, there are two types of books: page turners and books that move very slowly but have a lot of substance. The Other Boleyn Girl is the latter. I kept reading this book because I have this unwavering commitment to finish a book, hoping that the end will somehow redeem this craptastic fest of trash. This book really teeters on the border of a trashy romance novel. I will never read anything by Gregory again.",0
II will admit first of all that I did not finish this book. I had never read a book by Philippa Gregory and since I like historical fiction I thought I would give her books a try. I have never been a fan of romance so that might be why I found this book light on the history and heavy on the romance. It was just not my cup of tea.,0
"Words are wind, George, and you seem to like yours more than most. A ramble worthy of any mad Targaryen. Just finish the books, George.",0
"I listened to this on audio book over several days, it felt like forever. I wasn't too impressed. It was slow, slow, and did I mention slow. Then when it was interesting, it wasn't even worth all the slowness.  Won't be sampling Hemingway again anytime soon.",0
"I consider myself an amateur historian at this point.  I have read everything by Anya Seyton (the master) and Philipa Gregory(Other Boleyn Girl and Queen's Fool great, others are fading into 3 stars), watched every Hollywood and BBC rendition of anything referencing historical England and spend every spare dime on historical trips to England to see every castle and every pile of rocks that is ancient.I heard about Jean Plaidy's Plantagenet Series out of print from the 70's and Ebay'd the entire collection (over a dozen novels) out of excitement.  I read the first one and cannot bring myself to read the second, even though all sit on my shelf collecting dust.Then a friend bought 'the new book on Katherine Valois'.  I pick it up and start reading, not realizing it is Jean Plaidy.  I'm on page 20 and cannot get past this 3rd grade writing, lack of historical references.  It reads like a children's book!  There is no fact, no rich historical detail, making it feel like a supermarket novel and short choppy sentences make it annoying to read!  It's been by my bedside for 3 months, and cannot pick it up.Dissappointingly I say that this is a waste of time, because no one appreciates and loves an England/historical novel more than me.I honestly think this author is on autopilot, pushing out books one after the other, and sacrificing good, enticing reading in exchange for big bucks.  I honestly feel this author is insulting our intelligence.Highly NOT recommended.",0
"Red Mars is a little more hard sci-fi than I prefer. If you prefer science over story, then you will probably enjoy this book. I think KSR is a marvelous writer & his tale is a good and compelling one, it's just not my taste.",0
"I am a die-hard science fiction fan and this trilogy is what I usually like -- plausible science, fully developed characters. However, the pace is not just slow, it barely moves at all, and the plot gets lost along the way. This is the third time I have tried to read it, and I still couldn't finish -- too boring. There are long, long monologs on the science, and tensions in relationships that keep you hoping for some fireworks that in many cases never materialize.These are the most boring personalities that I have seen in fiction in a long time. The story never really engages you. Spend your time reading something else.",0
"Quartered Safe Out Here was far from the best personal accounts of participation in WWII.  It does not hold a candle to Eugene Sledge's, With the Old Breed.  Quartered is slow moving, without much real action.  Much of the action in the campaign seems to take place on other fronts, and this is mostly about ""camp life"".",0
Most of my beefs with this have been aired here.  This author was brilliant over the 1st four books - what happened?  How could he go from that to books 5 and 6?  Makes me thing he either has hired ghost writers or someone milli vanill-ied 1-4.  Anyone agree? The difference is that stark. Wish he'd go back to the mindset he was in back then.  I quit.,0
"I don't mind books that are slow moving, but my patience is being tested with this series.While ADWD at least fixes one of the major problems with AFfC since it does include the POVs of popular characters like Jon, Bran and Dany, each character faces more and more challenges and failures.  But it doesn't seem to be leading to anything. It's just going on and on with new secondary plots being introduced, but the overall plot of the series is no closer to any resolution.Like a AFfC, there are still too many random characters with POV chapters that add nothing to the overall story other than filler.  I found myself skimming over some chapters because they simply weren't compelling and I had no interest in what was going on.At the end of ADWD, I was left with a lack of hope for both the characters and the storyline.  It's now a series of disjointed storylines with the empty promise of a satisfying conclusion.With only two books left, I have my doubts about how the series will wrap up. But I'm fully expecting GRRM to announce that ASoIaF will be a 10 book series now.",0
"I read the first four books at rapid speed as I was enthralled by the story. The writing is very good and satisfying to those who like well constructed prose. Then I began &#34;Dance&#34; and started to get annoyed. The story  does not move forward. It gets stuck and becomes disjointed as Martin jumps from one character scenario to another. I felt as if the author was not sure where he wanted to take the story and got lost in giving us deeper details about the characters. Also I got personally angry about his killing off all my favorite characters, especially Jon Snow. And leaving Araya at loose ends not to mention what was up with her mother. This book seemed to me to be a stop gap for the author, as if he is treading water while he figures out how to bring the saga back to life. But who can wait so long for Martin to get it together. I for one am moving on.",0
"The Fionavar Tapestry left me with mixed feelings.  On one hand, some of the writing is very well done and some parts of the story, particularly Dave's first meeting with the Dalrei, are moving and enjoyable to read.  On the other hand, the story isn't very original and I never felt very involved with the characters.  The women in particular seemed to be poorly drawn and weren't very likable.The story revolves around five college students who have been brought to the fantasy land of Fionavar, a Middle Earth-like world which Kay tells us is the one true world.  The world of the college students, which is our own world, is but an imperfect reflection.  Kay tells us that problems in Fionavar will be reflected in all other worlds, including our own, but never gives any examples of this.The biggest problem with the trilogy is that the students interact amazingly well with Fionavar and its inhabitants right from the start.  I never understood why it was necessary to have the students originate in our world, because the story as a whole would change very little (and would make more sense) if they had been born and raised in Fionavar.  The students never use the knowledge and skills they've gained in their own world to aid Fionavar.  For instance, when they travel back home, why don't they take firearms and manuals on how to manufacture gunpowder and grenades with them on their return to Fionavar?  Fionavar is a world at war with an ancient evil, and yet they never mention or express a desire for any modern weaponry or a modern means of communication or transportation.  Furthermore, the students never get homesick, they never have trouble adjusting to this new and different culture, and oddly enough, when one of them is killed, no one ever wonders what they'll tell his family and friends back home.After the students are taken to Fionavar, Kay also adds King Arthur and Lancelot to his tale.  For some unexplained reason, Guinevere has been reincarnated but Arthur and Lancelot have to be resurrected.  Once in Fionavar, Arthur and Lancelot don't actually do much and almost seem to be superfluous.  Arthur's dog actually comes across as more heroic and has more personality Arthur does.  It felt like Kay couldn't decide whether he wanted to write an Arthurian novel or a fantasy novel and so decided to blend the two, with results that are less than satisifying.There is a subtle current of sexism running throughout the trilogy that made me uncomfortable.  While some of the most powerful people in Fionavar are women, the women are all involved in either religion or mysticism of some sort.  When it comes to battles, the women are either kept on the sidelines and expected to heal the injured or are left at home.  Kay describes nearly every woman as being earth-shatteringly beautiful and seems to feel that a woman must be beautiful to be important.  Part of Fionavar's history involves a woman called Lisen, who apparently never did anything more than look beautiful and act as an aid to her husband, yet the entire world still mourns her passing....",0
"Did not hold my interest. Bought it because the Netflix series is a favorite, but I couldn't get into this book.",0
This book could be about half it's published length. It goes on and on and on...Perhaps so the author can insert yet another rape scene? The writing itself isn't awful. But the characters' constant fowl language and the rape author's insatiable longing to write yet another rape scene ruin it.,0
"GRRM writes so well he almost gets away with not having much plot.  Almost.  I was unable to put down the first four installments in the Game of Thrones series; not so with Dragons, sorry to say.  In fact, it was something of a chore to get through.  I would say I don't want to give anything away, but honestly, there's not much to give away.  I felt a little irritated that after 1000 or so pages very little had really happened.  Big yawn. :|",0
"Bore me once, shame on you; bore me twice, I'm an idiot.

He doesn't care about shortchanging his readers, I certainly don't care to fork over money to help him do so.",0
"As a buff of Tudor history, I was shocked from the first page how incorrect the information was. Mary was not 13 or 14 when she became the mistress of Henry VIII - and, accepted historical information indicates that Mary was the OLDER sister, not the younger. What happened to the years spent in France and her being mistress to the King of France? Needless to say, just the first few pages frustrated me so badly that I ceased reading the book and shall not bother finishing it. This author has done a better job following historical information in some of her other books - I just can't imagine what happened here. And now, to think that the movie will project this information to people - but then, if they're not history buffs, they won't know any difference. It's like the cable series about The Tudors and the actor portraying Henry VIII is a scrawny little man instead of someone over 6 feet tall and well built! Oh well - Anyway, I would not recommend this book to anyone for any reason.",0
"I'd rather not try to pick thru profanity to get to a story.If it wasn't so vulgar, it might have been a good book.",0
"Sorry to all those people that seemingly loved this book, but i am afraid that i found it just woeful.  It was the sort of book that gives fantasy a bad name.  Indeed it is so inferior to such ""B"" grade fantasy as the Belgariad series that it would need a catergory all of its own.  As so many other reviewers have said it is an amalgam, a ""hash"" of Tolkien, Narnia, Arthurian myths and a myriad of other borrowed themes.  Surprisingly, upon acknowledgement of these borrowings, most reviewers go on to say this it was still a fine book?  The characterisation was stereotypical and superficial with little or no exploration of the potential for culture shock that C21st americans might experience in what would be their technological equivalent of a third world country.  There is so little to recommend this book that i am truly surprised that it has such a strong following.",0
"I'm beginning this ""review""(although it is more accurately a letter of complaint) before I've finished the book. At this point I'm 62 chapters in, and 81% done, and I'm sick to death of it. I'm struggling to finish, and I never not finish books. The only book I ever didn't finish in disgust was the first Wraethlu book and this is nearly as bad as that. I don't ever remember waiting this long for a book and being so disappointed. Even the Deathly Hallows didn't disappoint me as much as this, and that--if you'll remember my horror at that book--is saying something.I have now finished and while the book took a minor turn for the better it soon plummeted back into ""disappointing.""The main problem to me is that it's bloated beyond control. I can't blame the editors for this, because I understand they had very little time to manage a monster of a book and it had already been cut down by about a third, apparently, but there's so much padding it suffocates under its own weight, like Lord Manderley falling asleep on his wife, or something.Plus I would suspect that the editors worked on an arc, or a pov, and didn't see the book as a whole--but even if that was the case, there's no excuse for the repetition and rehashing Facts are repeated within the same POV - we are told a dozen (maybe two dozen) times how Tyrion killed his father and Shae, as if we'd forgotten, not only since reading the book where that happened, but since reading Tyrion's previous chapter. We are reminded, over and over and over and in fact, over, who is leal to Winterfell and who has turned their cloak and who are enemies--so many times that I just wanted to scream. Even Asha, who in previous books knows nothing of the grass-soft lords and their history, suddenly seems an expert and we are reminded YET AGAIN what the position is regarding the Karstarks.Every time we see Davos (and as much as I like Davos as a character I was glad we didn't see him more than we did or I would have given up reading altogether) we are reminded over and over (and indeed, over) and over again that he had seven sons and he's lost four and about his fingers.and every single thing else we've ever learned about this insignificant character. It's not as if this fact is pigging relevant. Then, when we are invested with all this time with Davos, he's dropped and we don't see where he goes, who he's with, blah de blah de blah. He's a deus ex machina, simply there to show plot points as they move on.So many chapters are not only rehashing, ""as you know, Bob"" narration and dialogue, but are entirely unnecessary. It seems that GRRM thought ""well, x person has got to get to x place so I'd better show the journey."" And the actual journeys are pointless.Seriously. Tyrion's entire story of hundreds of pages could have started ""Tyrion woke up and found he didn't like being a slave."" Yes,there was one vital character he met on his travels, but his interaction with him was inconsequential and we did need the whole journey and the turtles. Ditto for Quentyn's journey. Ditto for Victarian's journey.This is a classic example of his padding (in miniature)""the sky above Meereen was the colour of corpse flesh, dull and white and heavy, a mass of unbroken cloud from horizon to horizon. The sun was hidden behind a wall of cloud. it would set unseen, as it had risen unseen that morning.""You see what I mean. We've had a literary description of the wall of cloud in teh sky, then for people who don't quite get it, we get ""it's cloudy"" Then for the complete thickos we are told what the consequence of this will be.I am not judging the book on this one section, merely holding it up as a classic example of GRRM taking two or three ways to say the same thing. I have been tweeting over and over that ""nothing has happened yet"" and while that's not entirely true, it certainly felt like it--probably due to the over-weighted and bloated chapters that are nothing more than description and travelogue and internal (repetitious) dialogue and angsting and telling us crap we already know and listing everyone in the scene and every merchant and every turtle and every type of food and every mercenaryI have learned that - if you can take out a scene, or a chapter entirely and it makes no difference at all to the plot--then that scene is entirely irrelevant and should--must--be excised. Now, of course, I don't know GRRMS plan, it might be that there's a very good reason he left all the boring tripe in, but it didn't help to make this the kind of book that the first 3 were.The problem with the chapters that are (probably) essential is everyone's so bloody PASSIVE. There's a reason Jon is, so that didn't bother me, but what the hell happened to Dany and Tyrion? Did they both have lobotomies somewhere between books 4 and 5? Dany has gone down with a case of Tonks-itis. (Tonks, from Harry Potter was a smart, feisty auror -that alone meant she was in the top 3percent of her class--who rocked in the fighting department.She was clever, witty and amusing. Then in later books she fell in lurve, lost her powers, became nothing more than a weepy clinging woman and consequently died. Even when we see Ghost!Remus later on, she's not with him.) And Dany has gone the same way. She won a Horse Lord's heart, and his followers, and thousands of poorfolk's hearts, then turns into nothing more than a girl in love led by men.Love doesn't do well in this series,as a matter of course. Of course I know that the good side doesn't always win, but sheesh - sometimes they do. But there's no character here who falls in love who gets a fair deal. In fact, GRRM goes so far to list a whole heap of people who married for love and allthe appalling things that happened to them. (that's on top of the main characters who married for love and died horribly. Cat/Ned, Lysa, Dany/Drogo, Tyrion/Tysha and the others who loved without marriage and died horribly... Add to that the sudden homophobia from all corners,when it had been much more accepted before. No, love doesn't do well.LISTs: What was the point of all the lists? Naming every hostage that came through the wall? All the irritating hostages at irritating Meereen (is there a point to Meereen?) All with too many Zs in their names.There were (a paltry few) chapters I liked. Perhaps ten out of 70 PLUS. But they don't save this book which could have been cut in half and wouldn't have lost a thing.I will not be buying the next one. I'll get it from the library.",0
"The whole middle section of the book (about 400 pages) could have been edited out, which would have left room for more exciting final chapters. Martin seems to favor a flurry of plot twists at every book's finale, which is fine--but this time even these felt half-completed. Hopefully he'll listen to reviews and get a new editor for the next book.",0
"Title says it all. It took years for this book to come into our hands, and it falls short. I guess between his other books he was able to write and his HBO series even George has forgotten his story line. I for one will not wait another 6 years for book Six. Its a shame because this series could grip readers by the throat! But I can't justify the wait or tolerate the authors indifference to his readers.",0
"Like many others who have read this book, I've been fascinated by the Tudor era and have read quite a lot about it. I enjoyed the idea of a story written from the perspective of the sister and it was interesting up to a point, but then....Anne Boleyn is portrayed as such a hideous harridan that it's almost unbelievable that Henry VIII would have put up with her. Philippa Gregory has also taken every single accusation and rumor thrown at Anne during her trial (when her enemies were hell bent on character assassination) and uses them all as fact.  (brief spoiler), When Anne essentially gives birth to Rosemary's Baby/Eraserhead I actually laughed out loud.A good attempt, but ultimately this book disappointed me.",0
"I'm a big fan of Tom Clancy's thrillers. Unfortunately, most of what makes them enjoyable to me is sadly lacking in this novel - the intricate global conflicts between various countries and political groups, the gobs of military technology, the inner workings and interactions of various government agencies.What we are given here instead is a tale of one man fighting his own private war on drugs. An interesting idea, but unlike Mr. Clancy's usual subject matter he demonstrates little knowledge of the domestic U.S. drug trade. The Drugs Are Bad message is hammered home in an unnecessarily preachy manner, and I found myself wishing that Clancy had been more succinct. Nancy Reagan managed to sum up the point of this novel in three words, and I'll echo them as my advice to potential readers: Just Say No.",0
"I am trying to be fair, and I will not deny that this book had for me some elements of interest.  I read all 5 volumes in quick succession, and I still feel semi-invested.  But I am honestly not sure this volume (or even the series as a whole) deserves even the 2 stars I am tempted to give it.  GRRM has sucked me in, but he also makes me feel like a sucker.  And having read it, I would now give 10:1 odds that the series will never be completed.This latest volume alone contains 959 hardback pages; over 400,000 words; close to matching in length all 3 volumes of Tolkien's LORD OF THE RINGS.  How could a book this long contain so little in the way of plot progression?  Is the author stalling on purpose, or is this the only way he can cope with some weird kind of writer's block?Part of the problem was that George RR Martin, whatever his talent for piquing the readers interest and keeping him turning pages, was never that efficient a writer.  He often uses 10 words to say would could be better said in 5.  Even the early volumes could, in my opinion, be trimmed down significantly and be the better for it (in particular, I could have without the voyeuristic sex stuff, constant whore references, etc.).  But the level of inefficiency and bloat has increased with each volume, reaching new heights with the last two.The other part of the problem is the proliferation of characters and points of view (""POVs""):1. Game of Thrones:  9 povs2. Clash of Kings:  10 povs3. Storm of Swords:  12 povs4. Feast for Crows:  13 povs5. Dance with Dragons: 18 povs4/5. Feast/Dance combined:  25 povsIf you consider that FEAST and DANCE are supposed to be ""the same book"" divided by POV, then you can see that the number of POVs suddenly doubled after STORM.  No wonder the story suddenly became unmanageable for the author.  If one divides ones story between twice as many different characters in twice as many different locations, then the story can only progress half as fast.  And if your chapters contain twice as much bloat (as seems to have happened), the your story can only progress one quarter as fast.And then the author starts repeating himself, perhaps because he fears you have not seen So-and-So in so long that you have forgotten what happened last time.  More bloat.A third aspect of the problem is this:  In the first volume, not only were there only 9 povs, but they were mostly gathered in the same place and time and able to help a single storyline forward.  GAME OF THRONES started most of the main POVs together, such that there were initially 2 main threads, which then divided into 3 main threads.  Only at the end of the volume were the 7 surviving POVs completely scattered to the winds.  Then did the author require 2 more (larger) volumes to complete the same level of plot progression that the first volume had.  And yet many fans remained patient and even enthusiastic.  Then it got worse ...By the end of DANCE, we still have about 20 surviving POVs, and they are all still all scattered.  One would think that the author would recognize this problem created by this vast scope, and adjust his writing style accordingly.  But no.  He thinks he has the time to describe how it feels for a character to urinate, and then describe a conversation he has with another character about how good he is is at urinating.  Will his urinations skills have future plot relevance?  He thinks he has the time to spend an entire paragraph describing a humble boat whose sole plot function is to transport a minor character from point A to point B (and leave him there), and then the author wastes another paragraph on how this minor character could have arrived on a nicer boat had things been different.  George, you could have saved half a page, there.  There are COUNTLESS such examples.  Each chapter needs to have its length cut in half AT LEAST.So where are we now?  How close is he to finished.THRONES was originally sold as the first of a ""trilogy"" (though the author admits he already knew better at publicaton).  But his ""trilogy"" plan had originally been as follows:Part 1:  Game of Thrones:  Covering War of 5 Kings.Part 2:  Dance of Dragons:  Dany invades WesterosPart 3:  Winds of WinterWell, he ended up needing a full 3 volumes to complete part 1.  Part 2 was supposed to resume the story 5 years later, but for whatever reason, the author decided to scrap this plan and write an interim volume called ""FEAST FOR CROWS"".  Let's call this Part 1.5.  Well, as you recall, FEAST ended up becoming so bloated that it had to be split in two volumes, the second half being what is now being released as ""A Dance with Dragons.""But the bad news is, this unplanned Part 1.5 is not even finished.  All the threads that were set up in FEAST and DANCE to converge on Meereen have not reached there yet, as this latest closes.  Hey, remember that guy Victarion with the dragon horn who set off for Meereen at the beginning of FEAST FOR CROWS.  Well, he is still at sea.  BUT HE'S GETTING CLOSE!!!  When will Dany finally land in Westeros?  At this rate, it won't be until volume 7, because she will need all of Volume 6 to resolve the impending climax in Meereen.So here is a release schedule, with my estimated projections into the future, giving George 5 years to complete each future volume:Part I, Vol 1 (A Game of Thrones):  1996Part I, Vol 2 (A Clash of Kings):  1998Part I, Vol 3 (A Storm of Swords): 2000Part 1.5, Vol 1 (A Feast for Crows):  2005Part 1.5, Vol 2 (A Dance with Dragons):  2011Part 1.5, Vol 3 ...  2016 (Climax in Meereen)Part 2, Vol 1 .... 2021  Dany reaches Westeros)Part 2, Vol 2 .... 2026Part 2, Vol 3 .... 2031Part 3, Vol 1 .... 2036Part 3, Vol 2 .... 2041Part 3, Vol 3 .... 2046GRRM still says he hopes to finish the series in seven volumes.  But if that were so, those who believed that promise had a right to expect better story progress in this volume.  He should just be honest and say that he hopes to complete the series in 12 volumes and that he also hopes to live to be 120 in excellent health (don't we all).  That way, potential readers could make an informed decision as to whether they should invest time and money in this story.But I cannot see it at his current rate.  This story will not be resolved, and readers who hope for a resolution are wasting their time with it.  That's how I am calling it.  George, you are welcome to prove me wrong.",0
"Trite, by the numbers love story with spectacularly banal romantic dialogue.  The author doesn't bother with much setting or character development.  The two lead characters are two dimensional, with the girl too good to be true.He drinks on practically every page:  Wine, beer, cognac, vermouth, brandy, whiskey and soda; morning, noon or night.It's hard to imagine what anyone thinks is so great about this book.",0
"In Ice Station Zebra, a British secret service agent is given the aid of a U.S. nuclear submarine to investigate the fire that destroyed Ice Station Zebra, a weather research station that is also testing intelligence technology.Alistair MacLean really knows how to set up a story and characters. Within a few pages, we know the gritty world of the submarine, the hard-bitten men who serve in her, and the intense preoccupation of Carpenter, the narrator, who has both a professional and personal stake in discovering the fate of the ice station and the secret technology. MacLean is outstanding when he writes about jeopardy, and the men and the sub are in constant danger throughout the book.I found the resolution of the mystery very disappointing and substandard, straight out of an old Columbo in which the rumpled detective assembled the suspects in a room and then talked us through the unlikely scenario that made that person the murderer. It was made even worse by the fact that I guessed who the killer was on the very first page in which the character appeared.For that reason, I couldn't really recommend this particular book, though I am a fan of the author and plan to read more of his thrillers in the future.Reviewer: Liz Clare, co-author of the historical novel ""To the Ends of the Earth: The Last Journey of Lewis and Clark""",0
"I was very disappointed in this book.The plot doesn't develop significantly, but that is not my main criticism.I can see what Martin is doing with the story, and I appreciate it.It is a build-up, every story needs that.What lost me was the world-building.Way too many ""characters"" and ""cultures"".Endless lists of names and relations.What am I reading, a family tree?  Or a travel guide?I can see why the author might think this makes the world bigger and more realistic etc, but it fails.  Why am I wasting my time reading about hundreds of irrelevant not-even-secondary ""characters""?  Answer: I'm not.  I had to do the unthinkable and skim through this verbiage.  If you are a speed-reader, this is the perfect book to practice on.  I suspect Martin likes to make his readers suffer but I think he even failed at that here.  Instead of suffering I skipped.Pros: I enjoyed the descriptions of feasts - Jordan is a pro at that, and it makes my mouth water to read.  The early Tyrion chapters were a nice diversion.  I enjoyed the Theon plot arc, although it was horrifying.  The opening of his first chapter hit me unexpectedly, and my stomach still roils thinking about it.  Props to that, Martin, you got me.  I was not expecting that.  I also had some fun digging back into the 2nd and 3rd book to find out who ""Reek"" was.However, in the end, the book just wasn't believable.  The motivations and decisions of many characters felt forced.  For instance, why would the Boltons want Reek to listen in on their secret/personal talks?  Why, for the author to give the reader some juicy info.  Add in silly cliffhangers concluding each chapter, new POVs (more scenery, more setup, more verbiage), and cut-aways from action, and the book had me scratch my head thinking ""huh?"" instead of ""that's amazing!"" like the previous books.It's staggering how this series went from a focused dramatic saga to a recital of minutiae.  Martin must have gotten convinced along the way that the world-building was the best part of his books, because he's delved into that headfirst, trying to grow the world so large that it absorbs every possible name, event, history, etc.  But it just becomes encyclopedic in nature instead of dramatic, and all the superfluous stuffing smothers the story.I laughed at my friends who had been suckered into Jordan's pointless world.Joke is on me this time.  A Feast for Crows was superior to this book, at least the author's voice was confident.  A Dance with Dragons reads like a stunted and rickety mess.I am unsure whether to continue with this series.  Just because one of the books is bad doesn't mean all hope is lost.  But I am a little worried that with all the extra plot threads, I'll have no idea who is who and what is what next go round, and that the author will undoubtedly throw in hundreds more unnecessary characters.  There is just too much here, and little of it is interesting, and I only have so many brain cells to devote to fictional worlds.",0
"Usually enjoy Derek Robinson's books but this one I was quite disappointed with,had the tendency to even miss a page and still not lose any of the story",0
"It is not that the book is bad per-say it is just full of frivolous side plots, useless ponderings, and pointless details. This would be tolerable if he published one of these a year, but he doesn't. The end effect is you wait five years for half a story that is 950 pages long. Every story line ended with a cliff hanger and no resolution was reached for anyone or anything. It was like he got tired of writing with 50 pages to go and said ""f*** it, they can find out in the next book"". I suppose we will now need to wait another five years to find out who lives and who dies (2 different characters), which army wins the battle (3 different armies), and if the lost characters return (1 character). For those of you keeping track at home that is 6 story lines that were left as cliff hangers.I genuinely liked this series, at first. But each book seems to get worse. Not that the plot is bad, or the characters aren't compelling, but to get to those gems you have to wade through pages and pages of drivel. Mr. Martin, please, I beg you, by the old gods and the new, hire a good editor and heed their advice.",0
"What if Mars were colonized by Ralph Nader's campaign managers? Answering that uncompelling question is Kim Stanley Robinson, in a bid for left-wing bragging rights among his neighbors in infamous Davis, California, his cultural template for a utopian Mars society. The novel's only character development and dialogue involves a dozen or so main characters agonizing and bickering over hair-splitting differences in Green Party dogma. There's no dimension of the characters, of any personal motivation or romantic involvement, that doesn't serve as an addendum to ad nauseum political ramblings. Everyone bands together though to fight the real adversaries: the bloated Earthbound corporations, depicted as a caricature of pure evil in their insatiable quest to consume human dignity and the natural environment, and bent on extending their insidious reach to corrupt the unsullied red planet. A ham-fisted socio-economic polemic dressed up as a novel, which unfortunately doesn't work well as either: the repetitious, clich&eacute;d social critique is about at the intellectual level of a college freshman trying to show off to his parents on his first visit back home for Thanksgiving.Which is unfortunate, because interspersed among the leaden characters and left-wing rhetoric is also a fascinating, thoroughly researched look at the colonization and terraforming of Mars, in the finest tradition of ""hard sci-fi."" From landing, through base-building, prospecting, resource collection, exploration, etc., we are treated to an insider's peak at just how the first permanent crew on Mars would probably settle in and prepare the way for others to follow. Anyone interested in the science and engineering aspects of settling another planet will be spellbound by these passages.Even here, though, after borrowing extensively from what must have been an exhaustive review of the technical literature, the author egregiously leaves only the skimpiest possible reference to the actual developers of these speculative technologies for settling and terraforming. A page of notes listing references, or at least giving credit for specific bright ideas to their particular originators, would have been more fair. I've had to try to trace down individual references since reading the book to link the hastily mentioned names in the scant reference listing with their particular ideas and papers. This may not affect your ability to enjoy the book, but then again, I found it disappointing.Meanwhile, about halfway through the novel, the first ship of settlers are no longer alone on Mars as hordes of new ships start showing up, at which point the only interesting material from the novel gets phased out in favor of more and more squawking about the same issues. (and more, and more... a decent editor would have insisted he trim half the bulk away, it still would have been more than enough to cover the same material.) Anything incidental, like how or why all these people are leaving Earth for Mars in the first place, is ignored. Although characters start getting killed off at a respectable pace, they remain content to spend all their time debating the fine points of surrendering private ownership of property to the collective community, prohibiting profit-motivated economic activity, and whatever else you're likely to overhear at any Davis-area Starbucks. If you think you'd find this an unacceptable substitute to realistic characters with compelling dialogue and an intriguing plot, maybe we can petition Robinson's editor to pass his stack of references to Orson Scott Card for the next sequel.",0
"I don't really know what to say about this. I rated it 2 stars because I guess I enjoyed parts of it? I actually did enjoy Bran's chapters, but there was precious little of that. And I enjoyed Barristan Selmy, because it was such a relief to be in his head after so many bleak, cruel, depraved, or hopeless perspectives.The overall feeling is bad, though, and I feel really bothered and annoyed with the direction of the storyline in almost every specific case. I put it down, completely fed up, after one of the Asha chapters, read a couple of other books, and then picked it up again. The author is supposedly ""realistic"" in that, you know, sometimes bad stuff happens and the good guys don't always win. But this is beyond unrealistic. This is gratuitously dark. And rapey, wtf. I don't even understand, at this point, how any of these characters managed to be born, or any of these long family lines survived long enough for these characters to exist, with all the bad things that constantly happen and how evil and rotten 90% of the people in the world seem to be. I felt really uncomfortable reading a lot of this. Even right from the very prologue, I was just sickened. But it really set the tone of the book. So, if you start it up and find the prologue off-putting, keep that in mind. I'm annoyed with this story, annoyed that I've invested so much in these characters to only watch pointless, horrible things happen to everybody.",0
"I hate not finishing a book that I've started, but in the case of this incredibly long, drawn-out, and boring novel, I had no qualms whatsoever. The characters are as unsympathetic as they come, with the 2-D Maria who has probably never entertained a thought in her head, she is so stupid and empty, except to please Robert Jordan, who spends hundreds and hundreds of pages just thinking random thoughts, and walking from place to place. I thought that Anna Karenina was long and drawn out, but even at 800 + pages that book was less drawn out than this wprthless piece. It was completely unnecessary for it to be so long--one of Hemingway's short stories, about an old man on a bridge during the spanish civil war, at less than 3 pages is ten times more movign and poignant than this book. And it doesn't even really paint the Spanish civil war all that well--if you really want a glimpse of what it was like, go rent and watch the classic movie ""La lengua de los mariposas"" or ""Butterfly"" in English, which will give you a better idea and much mroe enjoyment at the same time. This book also isn't really that action-packed at all for a war book--I'd say fighting and battle takes up maybe two-fifths fo the book at the most, it's mostly just talking, long stories, long ten page thought streams of RJ, or just walking from place to place, describing things with some of the longest run-on sentences I've ever seen (anyone who tells you that Hemingway's style was just short and simple sentences is full of it in regard to this book).In short, this book is not worth your time--read one of Hemingway's short stories if you must, but not this long, drawn out, boring yarn.",0
"While I usually love Agatha Christie, I found this novel rather dull and quite disappointing. It wasn't the typical body-at-the-start book, where a mystery must be solved, and that may be part of the reason I didn't enjoy it as much; in addition, the twist seemed to come on... a bit too fast. I felt like I knew the twist, but only because (I think?) I may have seen the movie version of the book at one time or another -- clearly it was unmemorable, if I had seen it.In all, I suggest you steer clear. The first part was fun, but the majority wasn't, and the end did not make up for it.",0
"Sheldon tried to create a plot consisting of a string of unrelated scams pulled by his heroine Tracy White, succeeding in all of them, certainly, this is very difficult to believe by a serious reader. The main character and heroine, Tracy White working for a man named Gunther, becomes a modern Robin Hood ripping off cardboard characters of unsavory reputations with no logical reason at all, just for the sake of doing. The so called story goes superbly fast and the scores of situations popping up get solved in a couple of pages one after another with an abuse of twist and turns but there is no plot after all. I have rated it two stars one goes for the poor quality and another goes for the fun the story sometimes carries on, particularly in the beginning. If this is your first time with Sidney Sheldon, try other Sheldon novels, i.e ""Master of the Game"".",0
"First off, I am not finished reading Dragons yet. I'm a quarter way through, but that doesn't mean I can't comment on this book because the errors Martin made in ""Feast for Crows"" are just as apparent as they are here.From what I've read so far (and this includes ""Crows"") this series is out of control. The +200 pages I have read are bursting with clumsy writing, people wandering and sailing forever, and a constantly expanding universe of new characters, new cultures and new plot lines - all of which I find displeasing. I'm already burdened with remembering who the Lannisters, Starks, Martells, Freys, Tullys, and every one else involved is. Please stop adding new characters.When I read ""Game of Thrones,"" it was simple. Now it's agonizingly complicated, all because Martin has forgotten where his epic is going.Thanks, sir, for complicating an already needlessly complicated epic. I will finish Dragons, but I do so under protest.",0
"I read the free preview on my kindle and liked it so bought the book.  I enjoyed the beginning but toward the middle - I was at 41% and was surprised that I wasn't farther along- it just seemed to stall and be so much of the same thing.  Main character Anna lacking confidence, scared not knowing whom to trust.  Soap opera dialogue between characters.  I didn't finish the book.  I couldn't take it any more and figured there was a better book out there to read.",0

"I had a professor once that said you should make any work of art strange enough to be interesting, but if you get too weird, people will get bored and go do something else. I had a lot of time to think about that precept while I was reading this book, because my mind was constantly wandering as I dutifully trudged through these tedious pages.Maybe I should start off by saying I really loved the first two or three books. In most books you're willing to put up with a certain amount of what you could call informational garbage. Pages that aren't necessary to the plot, but they fill out the characters in an interesting way. The detail on the whaling industry in Moby Dick is an often-noted example. There seems to be a lot of dalliance for its own sake in these books, and although at first it's something I put up with and even enjoyed, somewhere the balance tipped and beyond that point the book became a slog.I read one review the title of which was apt and creative: ""The song has become a noodling free jam"". When a main character dies, it's exciting and chilling, and you wonder who's going to fill the power vacuum. But after five books, they're dropping like flies; you invest time and emotion in a major charismatic player, they get murdered, and you stop seeing the value in emotional investment. On the other side of that same coin, so many of these dead characters become magically resurrected that it's usually two or three hundred pages before I allow myself to believe that someone is actually dead.I wanted to finish the book, so, even though I wasn't enjoying it per se, I plowed through the final three or four hundred pages. The ending of the book was like the beginning and the middle. Seemed somewhat vague and unsatisfying; why should we care about these characters? Where's the trajectory? What's the point?",0
I am not a big fan of books on tape.  My husband is...on long trips we listen. If you dont mind listening to an old man with wet phlegm in his throat for hours ...go for it.  Since I picked this tape based on the reviews from Amazon I suffered through 5 dvd's so far. The story is not interesting or enlightening. A bad story can be read thru rather quickly but on tape listening at a horribly slow pace....well  ...it is like water torture.,0

"This book has about one-fifth the ""story line"" even of book 4, and instead fills the pages with excruciatingly detailed descriptions of the bloody flux, greyscale, bad weather and maggoty food.  NOT what one would expect from the author being touted as the ""American Tolkein.""It's utterly unsatisfying, to the point where I am dumping it and the other 4 books at the local library.If you feel compelled to read it, just to find out how bad it is for yourself, at least don't spend any money on it.  Go get it at the library.  You'll feel slightly less ripped off that way",0
"This book is quite boring and provides little to no suspense. I would strongly recommend that readers avoid this novel.I skipped the fourth book in the series, ""A Feast For Crows"", because of horrific ""word-of-mouth"" feedback, and should not have invested time reading this novel either.The first book in this series was excellent, and the second one was quite good, but each successive novel is more tedious than the prior one. Needless to say, ""A Dance with Dragons"" is the most boring novel of the series thus far.The author continually drones on and on about inane, nonconsequential matters. He spends inordinate amounts of time describing scenery in the most minute detail, and also subjects the readers to numerous narratives that possess zero entertainment value. For example, readers should not read a single Daenerys narrative (they are the equivalent of ""watching paint dry"").At this point, Mr. Martin is solely writing for the sake of writing. My view is that he plans to extend the serious indefinitely in order to reap as large a monetary windfall as possible.  There is a colossal difference in ""entertainment value"" between this book and the first book in the series.I gave this book 2-stars, rather than 1-star, because it is the perfect book to read prior to retiring for the evening. I normally finish a novel every week or two, but spent 3-months reading this novel. The book will undoubtedly put any reader to sleep within 5-20 minutes.  This book is perfect for someone who is hoping to fall asleep quickly.",0
Saw the movie first and was excited to read the book next. Very disappointed about the book. The movie carried the story line so much better. The worst thing about the book was the main character. In the movie at least they made him out to be a real hero. In the book he seems like a complete jerk.,0
"Martin's forte was his political intrigue and the unexpected way he killed off major characters.  Now, it seems everyone comes back from the dead, the political intrigue goes nowhere and he traded realistic fantasy for stupid absurd talking-tree fantasy.  Lots of people are on the move, but no one seems to get anywhere.  The Reek chapters are so over the top and frequent that I started to hate reading them - ""Oh God, not another stupid internal rhyming dialogue"" was a frequent thought.Martin has really started to let the size and scope of what he's doing overwhelm him.  It took five years for this...series of unresolved events.  I can only imagine how long we'll wait for more unresolved events, new POVs and new stupid rhymes from Reek (aka Theon).",0
"Here's the run down: You've got a emotionally compromised psychic investigator who has been sent to an intellectually compromised town. He's heard creepy stuff has been happening and he's a scientist sent to do his thing. He does everything but behave like one however.To give him credit, 'ol Herb the author did have some suspense going. But as I was turning the pages, I was grimacing to find out what was next. There was an exceedingly large portion of icky violent scenes. And by ick, I mean things being ripped off, oozing down, cracking apart etc etc... Another con, would be the psychic-link romance quotient... Yeah, who'd a thought.",0
"Red Mars started off just dandy, with a variety of characters (a bit too one-dimensional, but hey) struggling with how to best colonize Mars.  No one was a 'good' guy or a 'bad' guy - just good hard sci-fi mixed with honest ideological differences.Halfway through the book, however, it all changed.  All of a sudden, Trans-national corporations are launching nukes, after buying out the United Nations.  Christian fundamentalists try to dominate the colonies.  A few hundred scientists on Mars discover wildly optimistic technologies, while the billions of people on Earth decend into chaos, primarily because of those darn evil trans-nationals.What started out as a balanced and interesting book jumped clear off the left end.  I'll only read the sequels because I want to read all the Hugo and Nebula award winners - not because I have any hope for the rest of the series.",0
Looked forward to this for many years.  Now that I have started it I am not sure I will go to the end.  This is because I don't think anything will happen.  In the first 500 pages we have not gotten anywhere.  Nothing looks to be close to resolution.  Characters are either struting in place or wandering aimlessly.I can put up with Dave Weber's data dumps because you know that something will happen by the end of the book.  After the previous book I had my doubts we would get any answers.  Now I am almost sure that we will be wondering we this book was written when we finished it.,0
"I have the paperback edition, published in 2008 by PM Press.  While I am more than sympathetic that it was printed by the ""Employee Owners of Thomson-Shore in Dexter, Michigan"", I have to say that the point size of the text is making my life miserable.  I try to keep my mind on the ideas expressed on the pages, but the tiny type size bothers me a great deal.  In addition, on some lines the point size is larger than others and some entire pages are a tad blurry.  I don't know if I have a copy from a bad print run or what, but it is really annoying and I don't think that I'll be able to finish the book.  The point size appears to be 8 and quoted text is 6, so it is quite small.  I have 20-20 corrected vision, but this is asking too much.  I may inquire of the publisher.  I wouldn't recommend buying this particular edition - if there is a hardcover edition with larger type size, I'd go with that edition. I'm giving the book a single star, simply because of its readability.  Perhaps that is not fair, but it is the only way I know of to draw attention to the serious defect of this edition.",0
"I am a natural speed reader & just received a Kindle for Christmas. I have been downloading favorites to the Kindle & just spent a few hours re-reading Clancy's ""Executive Orders"". The experience was totally spoiled by the HUNDREDS of typos, most typically ""c"" for ""e"" and vice versa. It really ruined the experience of reading a 2041KB (896 pg) book. Didn't anyone ever hear of SPELLCHECK? The book was FIVE STARS but the printing was awful.",0
"I have been reading this series since 1997, and it almost pains me to say that this book is not worthy of the first three.The fourth book, Feast for Crows, received a good review from me based on the assumption that Martin would follow his original plan and focus on the characters we care most about in Dance.He betrayed that idea.  Dance only follows Dany and Jon for a limited amount of time, and it introduces several characters that no one cares about because we don't know them.  The book was a waste of time and money, and it may have kept me from finishing the series.Martin is receiving undeserved rave reviews for this book from critics based on the fact that he has a television show.  Anyone who has been reading Martin for a while knows that this book is a colossal failure compared to his previous work.  If you are not hell-bent on finishing this series, leave it alone.",0
"I purchased this book because it received great reviews from readers on amazon.com.  Truthfully, I was disappointed because I found the book rather dull.  There was very little action in the novel and I did not emphathize with any of the characters other than Jankowski in his 90s in the assisted living facility.  The insight provided into the ""circus world"" of the Great Depression was interesting, but overall, I would not recommend the book.",0
"The book is well-written, and if you like the rest of the series, you will like this. It still only deserves 1 or 2 stars in my opinion for 2 reasons:1) Too many characters that died (or seemed to) in the previous books come magically back to life. This Deus ex Machina will not help the plot. In real life, we deal with dead people and the problems the deaths left behind. The first books did that. This book tells us that they weren't really dead -- it was a deception. Blech.2)Martin pulls a Robert Jordan and creates new points of view that extend the plot rather than wrapping up plot threads. We want an ending to the series, even if it makes us sad to see it wrapped up.I also found it confusing to read, because even though I know it takes place concurrent with the previous novel, it was hard to mentally go back to ""before this happened."" I will have to get both converted to text, then rearrange all the chapters of both books chronologically to get a better picture.My request as a reader: Let the dead stay dead. Minimize the points of view. Write the end of the series now, and then write everything that happens between Dance and the end. But make sure the end is written -- if you die, at least we'll have a satisfying ending to a wonderful literary banquet.",0
"My expectations remained just that, expectations. Did not enjoy the book. I would have prefered to see the book continue in the same way as the rest of the books.",0
"I could not finish this book. It might have been interesting were it not for the terrible language, the graphic and totally disgusting sex scenes, and the cruelty to animals... ugh! I hated it!!! I still have the scene of the masturbating dwarf etched in my mind, and I read the book over a year ago!",0
"At the Frankfurt airport the diplomat Sir Stafford Nye takes an enormous risk when he gives, without questions, his flamboyant cloak and his passport to a young woman who slightly resembles himself. But the woman is desperate and tells him that it truly is a matter of life and death. She must take a seat in the airplane from Frankfurt to London and no one must know who she really is, because that would mean certain death. Later he understands that she did not exaggerate a bit when he learns who she is and what her real purpose was.Passenger to Frankfurt has nothing to recommend it; except for the study it provides of an author in declining years trying to concoct a plot that involves topics like world domination and fascism. The novel subsequently stays always one pace removed from reality and the characters seem to be as lost as any reader would be.Agatha Christie wrote this book as a birthday treat in 1970, the year she became eighty. Fans deserved a somewhat nicer present, I think. Even the publisher realized that the story would be hard to sell to the readers and insisted on the subtitle ""An Extravaganza"".",0
"Ice and Fire Books 1 through 3 are brutal, powerful, and engaging if you can look beyond the cruelty and enjoy the ""game"".  Book 4 is brutal, ponderous and not very interesting.  Book 5 is brutal, boring, circuitous, and disappointing, and contains nothing but cruelty.  Martin has lost the game, dropped the reins, left the building.Having just slogged through ""A Dance with Dragons"", I am no longer interested in the fates of the characters -- those who remain -- and Mr. Martin's world has become an endless, dreary hell of death, destruction and despair.  I will not buy Books 6 through Infinity as I don't want to read about unrelenting hatred, gratuitous violence, baby killing, blood sacrifice, grotesque animal abuse, face eating and/or excrement eating, body fluids, gore, little boys being thrown overboard because ""their kind"" shouldn't be allowed to live, and men whose only use for women is to ""take"" them forcibly as a prelude to killing them.  Really, how many child rapes can an author cram into a series?  Hey! I enjoy sex scenes as much as the next person, but some of this dreadful stuff is kiddie porn.It seems that Mr. Martin continues to write not to advance the story lines established in Books 1-3, but to vividly describe each and every horrible way a woman, man, child, infant, or beast can be gruesomely hurt and/or die.  And, oh yeah, forget about dying and coming back to a happy afterlife! Indeed, every story development that could be considered even slightly uplifting was left hanging back in Book 3.In some reviews of the early Ice and Fire books, Martin was favorably compared to Tolkien -- undeniably, Martin can write a powerful description. And, each author does have a double-barreled middle name! However, Tolkien developed an intricate, magical world in which loyalty, compassion, honor and even--gasp!--love could endure.  Martin's world is so dark and his characters so despicable that nothing worthy can endure. Tolkien wrote about a quest, Martin writes about --what? -- who cares?Take the advice of many reviewers -- save your grey matter and skip this one.",0
"Like the previous book in the series, the story just goes on .. and on ... and on ... and nothing gets resolved. Martin can spend a full page describing what the participants are wearing at a meeting and then kill off a significant character in a short paragraph. I was entranced with the first two volumes, but now getting through the book is more of a chore than an adventure. I keep looking at the percentage left on the kindle and thinking - is anything going to happen?... is it over yet?",0
"After reading The Farseer Trilogy which was very promising, I decided to take another chance with the author and try The Ship of Magic series. This first book is very silly. The concept of a liveship which speaks to it's  occupants was intriguing but it loses it's appeal as the characters were  very annoying, and the magic was very unsophisticated. I tried very hard to  find some good in this novel but it falls short of anything spectacular.  Only for the extreemely imaginative and open minded. If you have your feet  planted firmly on the ground, this fantasy novel is not for you. Goodkind  fans will find this novel a hard read. The Farseer trilogy is far better.",0
I couldn't really get into the book.  Still have not seen the movie either but to me the book starts out slow and I hate books like that,0
Very disappointing.  A huge let down from previous books in the series. Not sure I will buy the next book....,0
"What started as quite interesting, turned out to be rather mundane.  Quiller, super-brain and second in world-importance only to The Person, fails to foresee what most readers would have guessed from the beginning.  Never once does he suspect that when everything goes ever-so smoothly, something may not be quite as it seems.  When I bought this e-book, I was thinking of ""The Quiller Memorandum"" which I remembered as very good.  ""The Ninth Directive"" didn't come close to it, in my mind.",0
"At the pace he is going he will be dead before winds of whatever comes out.  Shame, it is a decent story even if he does keep killing off major characters.  I am trusting in hbo writers to bring the story home because obviously this guy can't",0
"First off, I have the kindle version and it works just fine, I had no problems with it at all.  Now for the review of the bookThe first few books started out with a Bang and I thought we were going to get something special and new.  Instead this book has continued what started in the 3rd book with a descent in obsessiveness with mediocre ramblings that while connected to the main story do NOT in any way move the story forward.It's turning into the Wheel of time series for being excessively wordy and boring.  I honestly think that the writer is just writing to make money and not tell a story.The writer just fails to engage beyond the interest created in the first 2 books.  Great you're trying to give us plot twists and intrigue, possible redemption for a few and definite characters that are grey, neither good or bad, just normal.That doesn't mean that the author has to spend pages and pages without moving the story forward.  At this point, I'm not sure I'm going to read the rest of the books.  I don't like getting bilked and that's what this is starting to feel like.",0
"If I wasn't already bought into the series with books 1-4 (and if I hadn't waited 6 years for it) I would not have finished this book. This book is a perfect example of what happens when you don't plan out exactly what you're doing. I think GRRM really screwed up big time with AFFC and now this. He introduced too many PoVs and the book starts to feel really disjointed about halfway through when it seems like nothing happens with many of the main characters just so we can get more of the PoVs in. Characters like Victarion and Asha are super interesting and all, but they just don't advance the overall story.The mark of a series going sour in books and in TV is usually when you watch/read a bunch of stuff without anything really happening. There is really no other way to describe this book. Let's look at some examples (minor spoilers):Tyrion - A favorite character to many; last we heard from him he was being squirreled off by Varys. In this book, he goes across the narrow sea and then does.... essentially nothing. If you read the preview chapter for Tyrion on GRRM's site, then you're pretty much where I am after reading the book.Danaerys - This was the biggest travesty of them all. Literally zero movement here.Jon - This character had some movement, though if you've read the preview chapter (posted on GRRM's site in 2008) there is really nothing of interest here until the last Jon Snow chapter in the book.Theon - This character was pointless and drawn out.Overall, as well, there is VERY little different in this book.The whole idea of this book is to try and take as long as possible to build stuff up as to make even the smallest changes seem epic. Things like Theon's escape attempt takes many, many needless chapters of labored anguish. Why?!The whole book is structured foolishly as well: the first half is split about evenly between Tyrion, Jon, and Danaerys with some Theon sprinkled in. The characters move slowly, but it's acceptable. After the first half, the book turns into PoV after random PoV. Asha, Victarion, Melisandre, Barristan, it's just random person after random person and then it brings people back from AFFC. Of course, nothing is going to get tied up! The story basically stops halfway through the book!This is the problem with this whole 'time split' thing. He needed more PoVs for AFFC and so now he needs to wrap those PoVs up, even though the story doesn't need them to continue. Textbook case of good intentions gone wrong. Bit sad to see this happen to a great series.",0
"I have come to the conclusion that political dramas are best for me on screen.  Having this original story have a lot to do with a government that I am not as familiar with most likely made this a 2 instead of a 3 and that is not the authors fault at all.  The story was written well, and there were some interesting scenes but I struggled through this book and at times felt it more of a chore to read.",0
"The main characters are, with two exceptions, despicable.  The heroine alone is redeemable.  Even the hero, her choice, is shallow and unbelievable.  The highly improbable, but effective detective is the only other character worth a fig.  I am thoroughly disgusted with Sheldon.",0
I was looking for a good read and after seeing the high marks this book received I thought I couldn't go wrong. I put it down halfway thru and only picked it back up because I paid for it. I read alot and I just don't get the extreme praise this book racked up.,0
"I was an avid fan of the first 3 George R R Martin books in this series and I anxiously awaited this last one to come out, especially since it took around 6 years to write. I was horribly disappointed by this book and I honestly could not finish it.The sad truth is is that this book could have been about 300 pages and still accomplished the amount of story told in this book. Nothing actually happens. Although a large amount of time passes in this book it seems like none of the main characters actually get anywhere or accomplish anything. In fact, most of the book is about people just sitting around and talking, their is a chapter were a character is sitting in a room talking and only 1 sentence said in the course of 15 pages is relevant and actually forwards the plot any at all. At times I would start a chapter and wonder if I should just skim it because I wondered if it would be relevant or another character simply walking around and talking about his or her day. Their is also very little action in this book, maybe 1 fight that lasts half a chapter, which also hurts this book tremendously as the previous once were a non stop thrill ride.I wanted to like this book, I truly did. The fact that nothing happens and that I don't feel like I have enriched myself or the story ANY makes me realize what a tremendous waste of time it was to read this book. I pray that his last 2 books liven up the story, I would hate to have this book end on such a horrendous note.",0
"This book is not what I expected at all.....I guess I expected more of a love story as well as an adventure and what I got was neither. While I give the author credit for her obvious research on the era...the story was so incredibly slow!!! I kept thinking ""is this over yet??""  I wanted to like it I really did. Definitely a disappointment. I wish I thought differently.",0
"Excellent books inspire readers to write excellent reviews.  Red Mars however is so tedious that even writing a review about what is wrong with it feels a lot worse than Monday shaving.Where to start?From the huge portion of the book, around 10 to 15% of it, which reads like a tractor operation manual?From the obnoxious and unpleasant characters, with nothing to like about almost all of them?From the magic elixir of youth discovered conveniently by a handful of Martian scientists?From the overall feeling, that colonizing Mars is something like a weekend trip to the beach?I could go on for ages, but it is pointless and I already feel the chore of writing this review heavy on me. If this is the best way Mars is colonized in literature, I would be glad never to leave the Earth - Luna system and read again and again the Heinleinian colonization with the Moon Is a Harsh Mistress.Still 2 stars for a two-page debate about the preservation of Mars, where the writer rises to a level well above his potential.",0
This was a substandard piece of work by Agatha Christie. The plot is boring. The main character unsympathetic. I didn't like it.,0
"I will admit, I usually would not write a review for a book if I do not finish it, however my feelings for this book are exactly why I never finished it.I first bought the book around three or four years ago and tried to read it then. I got about halfway through before it became too boring. More recently, I tried reading it again from the beginning and got less than halfway through.The main problem with Red Mars is that the author finds it necessary to put in an excruciatingly large amount of detail in everything. From describing procedures the astronauts use to descriptions of the Martian environment. A certain amount of detail is nice and helps create a vivid image, but I am not an astronaut-in-training so all the excessive technical detail should have been avoided.In my own opinion, pretty much every character in the book is annoying. I found some of them rather flat. They seem intent on talking politics (read: the author's political beliefs) or getting themselves into love triangles and wondering what went wrong. This does not help when the story shifts from one character to another when it is hard to like any of them.The book teeters on the edge of complete implausibility. I can believe the technology used to get the First Hundred to Mars, but the fun ends there. First, we are led to believe that space agencies would be so mind-blowingly incompetent as to send a bunch of under-qualified astronauts on a long-term mission to Mars. Later in the book (and I do not think I am spoiling much here), the colonists come up with a plan to use a bunch of wind-powered heaters to increase the overall temperature of Mars. Nonsense.I had hoped to read the entire trilogy as an epic story about colonizing and terraforming Mars. Instead I never made it more than halfway through the first book. If you want some real science fiction, go read some Clarke. This book did nothing for me.",0
"This is a fantasy book for teens.  Yep!  There really are evil monsters that follow the biddings of satanic witches.  Our trucker hero, Josh, is caught up in a small, isolated Virginia town's nightmare when he accidentally runs over a newborn in a stroller.When he refuses to recant his story that an evil woman pushed the stroller purposefully into the truck's path, the bad guys have got to silence him.This was written in an average writing style with silly, unbelievable characters.  Gray, I'm sure, will have lots of followers--those who like books about witches, dragons, zombies, and anything else teenager-ish.  Please don't waste your time with this!",0
"So, this is the dreck that is passing for 'modern literature' these days? Honestly, after hearing some very good reviews about this books (actually, the reviews came to me via a co-worker who pressed a hand to her stomach, frowned and said, ""my daughter and I loved this book"") I figured I would give it a try.The first sign that this was not going to wind up on my favorite book list was that after an hour or so of reading, I realized that I was more than 100 pages in. Normally when I'm reading, I pause occasionally to think, reflect, sympathize, emphasize, synthesize, etc, etc, etc. But alas, nothing deep and worthy of reflection was to be found. Nothing to stop me reading for a moment to think about what I'd just read. Not that I was expecting much, but I find myself more appreciative of a book, story, news article, movie or television show if it can make me think about at least something more than the words in front of my face. Again, not here. There was nothing to be found.Eventually, as the story continued and I learned more about Jacob and the circus, I can't say I was surprised when I found myself not caring one way or the other what was going to happen to him, or the rest of the circus bunch - there was nothing for me to connect myself to these characters with. If anything, the more I read, the more impressed I became with the author's ability to keep me so detached!In addition to the weak and utterly predictable story, (I mean, who didn't see that August was either bi-polar or a schizophrenic, that Marlena was going to get pregnant, or that Jacob's family wasn't going to show?), the dialogue comes out incredibly thin - to the point that I'm actually thinking that the author has never heard two people speak to one another. The dialogue comes across as forced and, for lack of a better term, soap opera-ish. I half expected to hear the dramatic soap opera bumper at the end of each chapter ""will Jacob get the girl, will August find out about their illicit love affair and will Rosie finally learn English? Tune in next chapter..""But I digress. For everything I've stacked in the negative column about this book, there is one redeeming quality - and that is the story. I'm (somewhat) not ashamed to admit that I literally couldn't put this book down. It was like literary candy on a rainy day (actually a smoky day here in So-Cal). I picked up the book at 8am and set it down again around 10pm (having stopped for food, news updates, etc). Needless to say, I was disappointed.Overall, a good book for when you require some mindless entertainment - like sitting in an airport, or on death row.Finally, I was not impressed with the authors use of 'authentic circus lingo.' Apparently, she did some research. Well, I should hope so!",0
"I enjoyed the first three books. There were some really interesting characters and twists and turns. I don't know if dementure set in or what but Martin lost the plot in books 4 and 5, literally. It kind of reminded me of Anne Rice novels from the 80s. Way too much detail and side plots that were frankly boring and irrelavant. Meanwhile the really interesting plots moved at a snails pace.I am able to read boring documents - believe me - but this was just too much. I barely read half of it and I won't be buying the last book I don't think. Such a waste as there were some exciting stories building. He just made it too complicated and not in a good way. In an extrecutiating way. There should have only been 4 books in the series total, with all the crap removed.",0
"The last time I read Clive Cussler was around twenty years ago, and the experience had not exactly had me wanting to read more.  Time, however, dulls the memory, and I'm a different reader than I once was.  When I had the opportunity to read Sahara, therefore, I was hopeful that the reading experience would be pleasant; alas, such hopes were to be crushed.  Sahara is not a good book, and reading it, I wonder exactly what makes Cussler such a popular author; maybe it's his exotic locales and his almost non-stop action; it certain isn't his ability to write.Sahara begins with a pair of prologues, the first dealing with a Confederate warship disappearing at the end of the Civil War, the second focusing on a female pilot crashing in the Sahara back in the 1930s.  We then go to modern times, where Dirk Pitt is called in to investigate a toxic waste runoff that threatens a biological catastrophe that could kill all humanity.  Standing in his way is an evil dictator in Mali who is almost cartoonish in his cruelty and an equally vicious billionaire.  Pitt's adventures will lead him throughout the Sahara in a series of adventures that bring him closer to the truth while battling soldiers and the hostile desert.What about the prologue material?  It turns out to have almost nothing to do with the main story.  The crashed plane is a mere plot device to rescue characters at an opportune moment, and the lost ship contributes even less, only really reappearing in something of an epilogue, in which we get some ludicrous distortion of history.  In literary terms, one is a deus ex machina, the other a non sequitir, and any time either one of these appears in a story, it is a substantial weakness.  With both, you have truly bad writing.The characters themselves are stiff and generally one-dimensional.  The villains are laughable clich&eacute;s and many of the heroes are little better, and between pure good and pure evil there is a Sahara of sorts with no one to be found.  Then there is Dirk Pitt.  A godlike man who never flinches from danger and always prevails.  Even when we are not seeing him beat the odds, we are having other characters praise him.There is enough cheesy dialogue to open a deli, but on the plus side, Cussler does have a decent (though not great) ability to describe settings, and his action sequences are often interesting if not really exciting.  Unfortunately, the chief virtue in this book is to make other books seem better in comparison.  For those who think I'm being overly hostile, read the far superior adventure stories of authors such as Wilbur Smith, Ken Follett or even Jon Land.  There are better authors out there; if Sahara is typical Clive Cussler, I strongly recommend skipping his books and going elsewhere.",0
"If I weren't an X-Files fan and didn't know how excellent the show was and how wonderful Mulder and Scully were I certaintly wouldn't run to watch an episode after this book. It was slow and very confusing at times, I found  myself wanting to skip whole pages. I missed Mulder and Scully's quick  paced banter they have on the show and found this not at all as good as any  of the episodes. I hope others are better.",0
"I endured this inartful, trite novel from beginning to end and I'm baffled by its popularity. Even as a peek into a fringe society it lacks any surprises. Frustratingly boring.",0
"I was looking forward to reading this book. I really was. I love sci-fi and the idea of going to Mars has always fascinated me.So needless to say I was a bit disappointed to find that reading Red Mars was about as interesting as watching paint dry. No, let me take that back...watching paint dry is more interesting.The book is two things: a character study and a detailed (painfully detailed) description of Mars itself.As for the character study: Different sections focus on a particular character and provide a view from inside that character's head, so to speak. The problem is that the characters aren't particularly interesting, putting a damper on the whole notion of ""character study.""As for a plot, well, there isn't much of one to speak of. Oh, there's a kind of overall direction of events, but nothing that one would confuse for an actual plot, heavans no.This must have been intentional and part of the artsy-fartsy idea the writer had when conceiving this book as I know that just about every first year writing student understands the idea of plotting.Oh wellAlong with this we get page after page of lovingly detailed exposition on Mars itself.Now, I find Mars fascinating. Just looking at the NASA lander pictures gives me chills. So trust me when I say that the reams of paper devoted to describing the planet gets gets old fast. You will get hundreds of pages describing just about every nook and cranny of Mars. I really can't imagine anyone finding this much detail interesting, unless one is a gelologist, naw...I don't think that I will continue on with the series at this point.",0
"I have read and enjoyed two other books in the Churchill series by Mr. Dobbs, but I can not recommend this one.  I stopped reading after roughly 300 pages.  Mr. Churchill is barely present in the first half of the book which is taken up by minor characters and minor sub plots.  Perhaps I missed out by not finishing the book but I could not see plodding through another 300 pages.",0
"After several recommendations I picked up this book. More than one of the reviews on here mentions 'Smartly written' and 'Supurb' I question where their bar of judgement is. 3 prime examples (there are many more) are:1- This serial killer did his first job at 12. Later in the book it refers back to this (from the killer's perspective/POV) and he is looking back on it SIXTY years ago. Simple math (apparently not done by the editors, writer, or any praiseworthy readers) puts our serial killer at 72 years old. And this 72 year old man bests kids at video games and kills an FBI agent with a knife in hand combat? -Get real.2- Yeah, we get it, Alex Cross is black. Does it really need to be mentioned on every single page? Was race the major motivator in this story? Seems like it was more of a focus than plot. Does it really matter what race he is?3- No matter how good Alex Cross might be at his job, a detective mouthing off to the police chief and the *Mayor* keeps his job and is allowed to say things like F__ you to his superiors? Unrealistic!New York Times Bestseller... about as realistic as the Academy Awards has become.",0
"Seriously, i wonder how Patterson ever became a Bestseller writer. Though this was my first experience with him, i've decided it will be also my last.I love serial killers books. I've reed some good classics. Psycho is still one of my favourite, and i cherish Red Dragon. But this book is just awful. Everything is wrong. Everything.The serial killer is not beliveable. He doesn't act as a real serial killer shoudl act. There's nothing more horrible than a serial killer who makes jokes about cutting up someone's penis and shoving it up one's mouth. it's just too funny to come from a man who should be lonely, methodical, devoted to his work. Instead, he has a perfect family and a house with a garden. What happened to the real killers, those who hide human body parts in the basement or in the attic, who have sexual innibitions... who are just real? Then there's his intelligence. He's anything but, because the writer doesn't try to show us that by actions, but merely by telling us.As for the detective, Alex Cross, he's so transparent, without characterization. he spends his time complaining and beeing sorry for the victims. What about thrying to get the killer?Patterson's narrative are even worst. The prose is very simple, as if the readers were too dumb to understand. And then there's his subplots: all that stuff about racism, all seen by the eyes of Cross, who is black. I understand the message, but Patterson doesn't make it sound true. It's not like he ever suffered this problems in his own skin, is it?Thus, avoid this book. There are better thrillers in the market awiting.",0
"I would review this book if I could get my hands on a paperback edition.  I am waiting for it to come out in paperback so I can read the book.  The hardback is too heavy for me to carry around with me.  It's been 2 years, what's the hold up?",0
"Ever hear the phrase ""suspension of disbelief""?  You'll need a truckload of it for this book.  The story is entertaining enough; I can see why it was made into a movie.  But you'll need to turn off the logical part of your brain as the invincible, superhuman Dirk Pitt achieves one utterly implausible escape after another.Cussler finally lost me when Dirk and his pal, after wandering in the Sahara Desert for days with no food or water, discover a crashed airplane and manage to rebuild it into a ""land yacht.""  They ride it to safety and are restored to perfect health in moments after guzzling some water.  Oh, please ...This was my first Clive Cussler novel, and I suspect it will be my last.",0
"I've always been a huge Agatha Christie fan, but this book is a complete departure from her usual work and I hate to say it, but it falls short. I always finish reading a book if I start it, but there were times when I was really tempted to just put this one down. If you're looking for classic Christie, this is probably not the book for you. I found the beginning quite good, but ended up plodding through the rest of it.",0
I managed to read half the book and then couldn't handle reading any more animal abuse. It was the worst I have ever read before. I should have known since it was written about a circus not to read it.,0
"If I live to be a thousand years old, I will never understand the hoopla surrounding this novel.  It was praised for its meticulous research, but while reading it I found myself thinking that it had been written by somebody who had never been to a circus, and I was unsurprised to find out that I was correct.  My first college roommate was a real circus girl, and I can tell you that Sara Gruen did not even scratch the surface of circus life.It's a rare writer who can write well in the voice of the gender they are not, and Sara Gruen is not eligible for that club.  If I had not known for sure that a woman had written it, it wouldn't have been a difficult guess.The story is so melodramatic, it belongs among the most florid of historical romantic fiction, and that is not my cup of tea.  I had to force myself to complete this book.  I wish I hadn't.",0
Wish I had waited until I could check it out of the library. Pointless meanness to characters I had come to admire.,0
"George R. R. Martin is a brilliant writer and he proves it here again. The problem is he has turned into a terrible storyteller. He does very little in ADWD to move the plot of the previous novels forward. I've highlighted a few of the many problems with the book below. Spoilers are ahead, so read at your own risk:-Why is Dany in Meereen for the whole book? What does this accomplish? Her character essentially resets at the end by meeting a khalasar on the Dothraki sea, but this time she can control a dragon. Did we really need hundreds of pages of her pining over Daario and worrying about her ""children"" that we don't care about at all? Get to Westeros already, woman!-Tyrion embracing his dwarfish ways, but doing relatively little throughout the book. I always enjoyed the Tyrion chapters, but they were extremely unsatisfying this time around. The only ones that were any good did not have to do with him, but with the introduction of Griff and Aegon.-The cliffhanger with Jon Snow that really seems laid on a little too think to be believable. And yet we still don't know about his parentage.-Jaime having one chapter that ended in a completely unsatisfying way.-Quentyn Martell's storyline bursting literally into flames; no point at all to the whole subplot.-Davos going off to find Rickon? Why? Rickon didn't ever factor into the books before, why should we care what happens to him?-Bran can look through trees...really? That's his power? Sigh...Bran somehow needs to be integrated into the proper plot of the books. So far he is just there being Bran.I really could keep going on and on about the deficits of this book. Granted, there were some good things that happened. I enjoyed Theon's and Barristan's chapters, since they are great characters (though I miss Theon now that he's Reek). Also, the addition of Aegon and Jon Connington shook things up immensely. Finally a Targaryen is in Westeros! (though not the one I expected).Basically, this just seemed like endless setup with very little that actually happened. I don't know if Martin has become paralyzed with his popularity, unable to appease both his fanbase and his editors (what editing they do is beyond me), or maybe he just doesn't know where his story is ultimately going.The Winds of Winter has been setup with 2 novels now over the course of 11 years. If Martin cannot deliver after spending 2,000 pages setting the stage, then he needs to relinquish his purported ""best living fantasy writer"" crown.I hope it doesn't disappoint. This one, however, did.",0
I must confess that I really enjoyed the first three books of this series. I was disappointed with this book as well as its predecessor. They were mostly filler and history lessons. I kept reading this book because I was attached to Snow (The only main character with a sense of honor). After I finished it I regretted deeply the hours of my life that were wasted on book that didn't deserve them. This book feels more like a horror flick: crude and pointless violence with no depth.,0
"I had the opportunity to meet Sara Gruen recently. She came to Fort Collins because her German Shephard needed open heart surgery, and while she was in town, she held a discussion/book signing at a local bookstore. Something she said struck me as rather odd. She said that she wanted the old circus photographs included in her novel because she didn't feel her readers would believe what she had written without the pictures. I'm not sure why she would feel this way, because as many reviewers have noted, her descriptions of the circus where the strongest parts of this novel.This was a book that I wanted to like better, but after all was said and done, it didn't leave much of an impression, other than her extensive research. The story, particularly the love story, was cliched, and the entire plot is predictable. Additionally, some parts of the story don't seem plausible. *SPOILER* For example, why would Jacob walk away from an Ivy League degree, needing only to complete a final exam? Yes, his parents were killed, but he knows that they made great sacrifices for him to attend Cornell. And what are the odds that when he jumps onto a passing train in the middle of the night, it just happens to be a circus train?In addition to the predictable plot, it was hard to relate to any of thecliched characters. I think it says a lot when the most interesting character in the book is Rosie the elephant. Jacob displays little or no character growth. And the book has a typical ""Hollywood"" ending where the good guys get everything they want, even though they've had to sacrifice virtually nothing. And some of the dialogue in this book reads like a romance novel.That said, there are flashes of quality in this novel. The sections that take place inside the nursing home are well done, and in fact, old Jacob is a more interesting character than young Jacob.I just wish that the author had taken as much care in plotting her book and developing her characters as she did in doing her research.",0
"I'm hardly a bleeding heart liberal and I thoroughly enjoyed ""Dirty Harry"" and ""Death Wish"" (movies that you could really relate to in the context of their time, when it seemed the criminals had more ""rights"" than their victims) but this book is too much even for me because the vigilante style ""justice"" that our hero, John Kelly, dispenses to Baltimore's drug dealers and pimps in his quest for revenge is almost impossible to justify. That's the principal plot of this book, along with a somewhat interesting sub-plot that explains how Kelly was recruited by the CIA to set up a mission to rescue some POW's in Vietnam, which in time led to his taking on a full time job with the Agency, along with the alias John Clark.What sets the story in motion is when Kelly encounters a skinny, but attractive girl named Pam who is on the run from a gang of vicious pimps/drug dealers. In the first 100 pages or so, he falls for her, and with the help of a friendly doctor, gets her cleaned up and drug free, only to lose her when the gang spots her riding with him through their turf. Right off the bat this seems like an act of monumental stupidity on Kelly's part. He knows how ruthless these gang types are, yet he brings her back to their neighborhood without putting her in any kind of disguise! What a bonehead! And to top if off, after he initially eludes the bad guys by driving his 4x4 through a muddy lot in which their low riding sports car gets stuck, he then parks just a few blocks away, where the villains track him down and ambush him, giving him a nasty shotgun blast to the arm while taking Pam to be killed in an extremely cruel fashion.The rest of the book is about Kelly's one-man mission of vengeance. He finds that by disguising himself as a wino, he can roam the gang's territory without attracting attention, and he then starts homing in on the gang as he kills off an assortment of small fry dealers in his quest for info on his real targets. And that really is the problem with this book. It is entirely reasonable to cheer him on when he actually starts working on Pam's killers, including a scene where he tortures to death a particularly vicious [man] named Billy, but the rest of his killings are little more than cold blooded murder. True, pimps and drug dealers tend to be human scumbags, but neither crime warrants the death penalty, as Clancy seems to be suggesting. Viewed purely as a work of fiction, ""Without Remorse"" is basically OK, but in moral terms it comes off as somewhat disturbing.",0
not for me.,0
"I did not like this book. I did not care for Wouk's depiction of women in general as I tried to read the book. Consequently, I did not finish this book.End of story.",0
"Because it did not let you look in the book you were not able to see and get a feel for the book, which is not a great book, so I beleive that is why they did not let you get a peek before buying.  I would not recommend this book.",0
I don't believe the story will ever be finished and I don't believe any additional books will recapture what made the series so addictive in Books 1 - 3.I sincerely hope that HBO cuts ties with the book after season 3 the way they did with the Sookie Stackhouse books OR that Martin gives up all together and lets talented ghost writers take the wheel.I'm kind of glad that the next book probably won't be out for six years because it will probably take that long for me to get over my bitterness over the weeks I wasted reading Books 4 and 5.,0
"Clancy's quality shot downhill, man. This is where his books moved from entertaining, engaging reads throughout to techno-porn and drivel. Red October, Clear and Present Danger, Patriot Games, and Without Remorse are his best ones, and the reasons are simple. They also provide a clear contrast with this book.1) The best, particularly Patriot Games and Without Remorse, are character and plot-driven. When characters develop, you can see it happen and understand the reasoning. They also don't solely fulfill stereotypes/archetypes, like the godless, moral-less mercenary terrorist. This loses that completely aside from Ryan and Ryan alone, and he's been developed plenty in the preceding books. I don't care about archetypal Indian Prime Ministers who are solely politicians and offer nothing interesting. I don't care about the aforementioned terrorist who is never even named. If a character arises that I do find interesting (IE Badrayn), I expect them to stay in the plot or at least have some resolution, not disappear halfway through when they should be central to the plot.2) They're not techno-porn. Part of Clancy's appeal has always been his realism, of course. The battle towards the end of this book is about a full 100 pages too long. Running through the minutiae of a large-scale tank battle without providing background on most of the commanders? Boring. Sum of All Fears is the worst about this but only in an isolated section - the techno-porn pervades this entire book and makes it quite hard to read, even for an engineering grad student.3) They're not preachy. The morality of the characters, fine, help explain their motivations. Discuss the problems associated with treating drug lords as criminals vs terrorists vs enemies of the state. This is where Clancy decided that he knows the solution to every political problem and his views are the only ones that make sense. Ok, rebuilding the government from scratch essentially is an interesting topic - doesn't mean I care at all that Clancy wants a flat tax. Red Rabbit is easily the worst in terms of this, but this book is where it started. Political drivel spouted from the characters fits - political drivel spouted from the narrator doesn't. You pick no-nonsense types to head your agencies and they push for new ideas - that doesn't mean theirs are the only ideas that make sense, unlike what is put forth here.4) The subplots are meaningful and tied together. The books aren't padded out (at least the good ones) with ridiculous plots that do absolutely nothing for the story. The subplot in this book about the Mountain Men serves no purpose whatsoever besides lengthening the story. They never meet up with any other characters, there's no evidence that any other pivotal characters ever learn they exist, and their plan amounts to nothing in the middle of nowhere. I can't believe the editor let this garbage stay in the story. Solely padding the story out.You can see the problems I have with this book. There are some interesting ideas, though - the reaction of world leaders to an untested new president who has never been scrutinized is intriguing. The political aspects are, also. There are way, way too many flaws here to overcome them, though. Clancy used to be able to spin a good yarn - Without Remorse is an excellent story and an excellent book. This is neither. Avoid this book if you haven't yet read it, and I can't say I recommend any of his later works. Stop before Debt of Honor, even.",0
"Clearly George Martin is being paid by the word.What else could account for a 1000-page novel, with more emphasis on describing food, clothing, hairstyles, scenery, and the genealogy of every plant the allegedly-main characters traipse by, on their slog from nowhere (the location the plot reached at the end of A Feast for Crows) to nowhere (the plot's final resting place)?The edition of A Feast for Crows that I read (from Amazon's box set of the first four novels) included an apology for that novel's lack of focus and plot development, with a promise that A Dance with Dragons would make up for it.  Consider that promise well and truly broken.Rather than plot advancement, we get a second helping of Feast's emphasis on who wore what, the trivialities on which they pondered as the trudge through exhaustively-described scenery, and a glutton's enthusiastic recounting of every dish at every meal, what it looked, smelled and tasted like, where the ingredients came from and how they were prepared, ad infinitum.  One suspects that the author was perpetually hungry while writing--and perhaps should have scheduled his time at the typewriter _after_ his meals, instead of before them.There's also the (now-formulaic) build-up of some character's plans, his surmounting obstacle after obstacle, drawing ever-nearer to success, and then -BOOM- death from out of nowhere.  Gratuitously killing off main characters just for the shock value ceased to entertain after about book 2.I'm grateful that I hadn't spent much time waiting for the release of this book, having been introduced to the series by HBO and having read all five in quick succession.  If I were one of the unlucky early-adopters who waited for years and years to get book 4 and then book 5, I might well be organizing some sort of sit-in protest at Bantam, until they agreed to handcuff no less than two rigorous editors to the author from now until the series is completed.As it is, I am unlikely to buy any further books in the series; I'll simply wait until others have bought, read, and been disappointed by them, and then borrow their copies.",0
"It reads like one of the weakest books in the WoT series.  So much useless detail that does not move the plot forward.  Remember when you had a paper that was due in two weeks and you tried and tried to write something and couldn't come up with anything.  But you put in enough filler that if changed the spacing to 1.5 and picked a different font you would get your minimum 10 pages, 8 of which was just restating the question ?  Yeah that paper is pretty much this book.",0
"We purchased this book after reading reviews that made it sound like it had the most in-depth coverage of Rome, even though we knew it wouldn't be good for carrying around with us as a guide. Unfortunately, after a week in Rome we decided this book was fairly worthless. If it provided deep history on the sites we saw (so we could review what we had seen in the evenings), I'd be thrilled. Unfortunately, the book comes with maps printed so small it's hard to read them even after you've seen the things they portray in person. And the guide has only a tiny amount of history and background on things... mostly it provides inane comments like ""to the left of XYZ, you'll see ABC"" which a guide like the Eyewitness Guide does more clearly with pictures. (Not to mention its descriptions say things like ""from the entrance you can see..."" without acknowledging that there are 6 separate entrances to the site or clarifying which one it's referring to.) It also provides distinctly un-insightful history saying things like ""[name] was the person who gave real meaning to the abbreviation S.P.Q.R"" but without actually telling you what SPQR stands for or how the person gave it meaning. Perhaps the book is a decent refresher for people who already know Rome's history, but don't expect any insight into things you don't already know. And it's definitely not a guide to carry with you--the maps are tiny and illegible with 3-point type, and the information too dense to find things quickly--it's laid out and reads like a 400 page novel.",0
"I understand that fiction is not always true-to-life.  But this story is SO far-fetched that it just makes bad fiction.  From beginning to end, it is just nonsense. There really is no other word to describe it.  I don't understand the raving reviews by some of the people on here. They must not read very much. I have enjoyed other books by Lisa Scottoline. This one is just awful.",0
"Bought, read, and promptly returned.  I know, it was bad.  But, in my defense, I couldn't help it!  The first three books were just so good.  Sure, Feast of Crows was disappointing, but (again) the first three books were just so good!  So, I had to know what happened.  I mean, GRRM might have turned it all around in this book.  Plus, it's well past the mid-point of the series, and we should finally be getting some answers (or so I thought).Well, we didn't.  In fact, other than some WTF moments, the book plods.  So, I've decided to give up this series altogether.  Don't get me wrong, the actual writing isn't bad (if overly repetitive and food-based) but the plot... GRRM's attempts to keep it compelling smack of desperation rather than inspiration.  And, that's a huge problem, because authors who try to consistently write ""twists"" into their books... well, it only works if they're truly inspired and the twists flow from the characters and the story itself.  The problem with Dragons is that GRRM seems to be trying to create ""twist"" plot points by throwing together new plots or characters, at the expense of the old and beloved ones.In fact, it almost feels as if GRRM got sick of writing the story/characters he wrote during the first three books, and decided to change it up and make it a little unpredictable.  Or, found something about the original situation didn't work, and couldn't quite figure out a way to paint himself out of that corner.  Unfortunately, in trying to solve his problem (to put it in tv parlance) he jumped the shark.Moreover, the way this book developed, and the lack of any kind of closure (or even move toward closure) makes me seriously suspect that he doesn't really know how to end this series.Oh well.  No hard feelings George.  It happens.  I get it.  I'm moving on.  Maybe IF the series is ever finished, and I hear enough glowing reviews from those who had the patience to stick with it, I may give it another go.  Until then though, this whole series gets chucked to the bookcase of shame in my garage.",0
"This book was the biggest crock of terrible historical fiction I've even had the misfortune to read. A friend lent it to me, knowing of my love for all things Tudor. A waste of paper and time--with each terrible page my blood pressure increased notch by notch. It wasn't even well written! By weaving her mis-information into this story, Ms. Gregory will only keep people whom are unfamiliar with Anne Boleyn's life even more ignorant of the facts. Historical fiction doesn't mean ""change the story around to whatever you want."" I've read some really great historical fiction where the author RESEARCHES the FACTS to try and tell a possible version of the truth. Not so here. So don't waste your money. Why do authors find it necessary to write for the lowest common denominator? It should have no stars.",0
"It was all I could do to muster the enthusiasm to read while engaged with this novel. Why? Very Technical. So much so it got into the way of the story. Disguised propaganda encased in a story? Yes. The idea of the story cloaked in this book kept me reading. If you must have the experience of pain reading this book, but do not want to read it, cut off a toe with a razor. You may feel the same after is all over.",0
"I love Hemingway, but this book bored me to tears. I'll concede that I watched the movie first and knowing the ending took some of the fun out of it. Go read A Moveable Feast. You can always come back to this one later.",0
This is a very small book - only 4 x 2.5 x 2-inches at best.  You may need a magnifying glass to read the tiny print.  Lookup entry is often a single word - can be misleading.  Not a friendly companion when reading latin.,0
"Maybe it gets to the exciting part somewhere, but all I've seen so far is melodrama and weird situations - like when the girl who the main character picks up  meets two strangers that are man and wife doctors, she allows the wife to give her a physical exposing that she was sexually brutalized and on drugs!Yeah, sure! And then this dock blabs it all to her new boyfriend, then the main character after sleeping with her for several days, only after the doc's report, notices the welt scars on her back!  Umm, I don't think so.And all this while, the main character is bawling about his wife who passed away 6 months prior, and the only action we get from him is him repairing the propellers on the doctors' boat!I am glad amazon has a lenient return policy. Four days of on and off reading and still no action gets this thing returned!",0

"This review is not about the book, story or author - I regret buying this book on the Kindle without Text to Speech. I am a busy reader that needs to keep a story going during my commute when I can't read - and then pick up reading when I have a break - publishers should be more concerned about selling books than limiting the medium of my unabridged consumption.",0
"Five books later at an expensive investment, I will not read Book 6, 7, 8, 9.....???I loved the first three, even four books.

Martin have to be so verboise?His fifth book of meanderings is useless.  He is like a mad man on speed, going off on moretangents than need be.I am angry that I spent the time and money on this one.But I will learn my lesson.  Skip this book five.  It in no way adds to the the earlierfour (that was suppose to be only a triology).It could have been a triology, but the editors' were  evidently  afraid of facingthe dragon RR Martin when he is  such a 'stark struck literary darling' as a never- endinggolden  purse for the publishers.....to rein him in on verbriage that never should have been allowed.But a golden calf is a golden calf....thinking of more gold by stretching these books out into infinity.No, I quit the series, now, once and for good.",0
Just plain bad.I struggled through more than half - then I gave up.,0
"Ok, so I have now read all five of the ""Ice and Fire"" series and can say that I will not be picking up the sixth when/if it ever comes out. The first three books are some of my favorite titles of all time. A Clash of Kings is just all around a great story with great character. And the next was good, but you could tell it was beginning to fall off. And then you get to A Feast for Crows where the whole series falls apart. You read about a bunch of character you don't care about and wonder ""Where the hell is Jon and Tyrion!"" Well you finally get them back in this book, but you will be very disappointed with these characters. The book in whole just never catches steam. You read about people walking, and thinking about doing something, and sitting in rooms with each other talking about doing something and then by the end, none of it happens.I know no review will make someone who has read all the books stop them from reading this one  I read a ton saying do not read this and look at me) but i figured I'd spare you the 15 bucks and tell you you are not missing anything.",0
"I agree with almost all of the reviews. I'm just so disappointed that the main characters from books 1-3 have been given such short shrift. I mean - come on already - at least tie up a few plot lines before inundating readers with new characters that come and go randomly through the last two books. I found myself going back and forth trying to figure out who the heck these people were when they popped up hundreds of pages later and no sooner do you figure it out than they disappear again completely. I get it, he's going to milk this since the series came out, but PLEASE resolve at least a few of the sub-plots about the random characters and get back to the meat of the first three books. I'm not opposed to continuing the story by any means, but it drove me nuts reading books four and five with basically NO resolution whatsoever. After reading all five books I just can't help thinking that the only things I know for sure is that Ned's dead, Jaime lost a hand and ""half a hundred"" is one of GRRM's favorite phrases - among others that we can all repeat by rote...all together now: ""about as useful as nipples on a breastplate"" - which has just occurred to me could pretty much describe the screwy timelines and general frustration in reading these last two books. I could go on, but I'll let George do that - if he ever gets around to it.",0
"This spy adventure starts out promisingly with an airport incident that can happen to anyone.  However, it quickly degenerates into plotlessness, lack of direction, and a boring lack of suspense.  The characters are so grotesque and unrealistic, that Christie loses one of her most formidable writing weapons: the ease with which her readers (normally) connect to the characters.  I could not connect, and after the first few chapters, could care less what happened to anyone.Christie uses this novel as a platform to present her age-old world view of a secret society that is plotting for world domination.  In it you see a lot of resentment towards the young, betraying the total incomprehension this octogenarian had for the generation of the 60s and 70s.  She mixes up student protests with leftist tendencies, ""violence for the sake of violence"", and neo-Nazi currents, all together.  Add to that the rambling, incoherent, conversation style of most characters, and you get a befuddled mess.What makes her other novels so great is her (usually) deep understanding of human nature.  Regrettably, she doesn't show this understanding here.  The young are mere hypnotist fodder, to be brainwashed by whoever is capable of doing so.Even worse than Elephants Can Remember, the only reason to read this is to say that you're read all of Christie's books.  I just quit halfway.",0
I first read &#34;The Demonologist&#34; fron Pyper and LOVED IT!!  So I bought &#34;The Guardians&#34; and &#34;Lost Girls&#34; with high expectations.  I first read &#34;The Guardians&#34; and really enjoyed that as well.  So I had high expectation for &#34;Lost Girls&#34;.  I struggled to finish the book.  Just a let down after reading Pyper's other two books.  The main character's personality was a turn off.  I didn't like the flow of the story.  I just found the storyline slow.  I might have had a different opinion had I read this book BEFORE the other two.  I just expected more.,0
"If this were the first Lisa Scottoline book I had ever read I would not read any others.  I don't remember ever hearing the word ""ridiculous"" scream in my head when reading her other books, but I sure did this time.  From the implausible premise that defense attorneys would be incensed to learn that their client is actually guilty (horrers!) to the lengths said attorneys would then go to prove him guilty including breaking the law this story is ridiculous.",0
"Water for Elephants has its good moments (a particular incident late in the book, during which the protagonist is standing over a sleeping but dangerous man with knife in hand trying to decide what to do next is hauntingly poignant), but all told, I'm glad that I read this book through the Kindle leasing program rather than buying it.There are several themes in Water for Elephants, including the lack of dignity often associated with the treatment of the elderly and the evil effects of greed. However, the backbone of the story seems to be a sort of iconoclasm. The Sterling images of the circus often inculcated in us during childhood are challenged by images of violence, animal cruelty, and graphic sexuality. However, the fact that this book unearths the dark side of the early twentieth century circus speaks less to its quality than to the fact that our society all too often allows commercialism and popular mythology to shape our images of the past. Simply challenging false notions held by society contributes very little to the value of a story like this one. In the end, the tone of the book takes on moods which can change violently from the darkly cynical to the unrealistically optimistic (the ending of the book feels impossible, illegal, and unsafe). Sentimentality, rather than a meaningful exploration of human emotion, dominates the scenes of the assisted living facility, although as noted above, the fact that those scenes also bring to light the continuing need for respect to the elderly does serve to redeem them to a decent extent.The story is, on some level, a ""forbidden romance"", and on this level, it has many failings. The rapidity with which Marlena falls for Jacob seems more indicative of a woman torn by the violent nature of her relationship than a woman in anything approaching love. The way in which August is killed seems to do nothing but Grant a legitimacy to the relationship via Pacidermis ex Machina, and to tie up loose ends.All in all, this isn't an awful book, but it seems to be the type of story commonly found in book discussion groups for all of two months before being rapidly forgotten. There is no real draw, beyond a handful of tense and well-written moments in the last quarter of the story.For the Kindle edition, images work surprisingly well, and I have no real complaints about formatting.",0
"The back cover of this book praises Beryl Bainbridge for her &quot;deadpan prose&quot; and her &quot;emotionless sentences&quot;. It's ironic how attibutes like these can possibly be descriptions of a good writer. It is these very faults that bring about the ruin of MASTER GEORGIE.The novel spans the years 1846-1854. Master Georgie, or George Hardy,  is the young son of a rich Liverpool merchant. He is a shadow figure in the sense that he never takes over the narration of the story. That is left up to three other characters. One of these is Myrtle, an orphan who was taken in by the Hardys as a child and is deeply in love with George. She follows him in his restless wanderings of Liverpool. One night, in a sordid episode they find George's father dead in the bed of a prostitute. Along with another character who does narration, Pompey Jones (a street hustler), they are able to cover up the scandal that would have hurt and tarnished his family. The three characters are bonded by this secret for the rest of their lives, and as the novel progresses this deepens into love, both sexual and spiritually. It becomes a love triangle which causes a lot of pain and little satisfaction. The last voice that enters into the picture is  the eccentric Dr. Potter who has a hankering for George's sister. Nobody likes the guy because instead of confronting life, he dwells instead in books, mainly the classical writers of Rome and Greece. When you start a conversation with him, he begins quoting from an author instead of communicating sense to you. Towards the latter part of the book, all the characters become involved in the Crimean War. Or actually George becomes involved in the war and wherever he is it sucks the others with him. Just like all wars, this one changes the future of not just the combatants but also of the bystanders.The parts of the book set in Liverpool are quite good and interesting. They seem to be written with more passion and personal knowledge than the war scenes. The books problem lies in the deadpan writing. It's like watching the stand up comedy of Steven Wright, where a monotone voice is supposed to make you laugh by its very absence of emotion. It's the same thing here. We are supposed to feel horror and love through understatement when neither of these emotions are capable of understatement. The closer I got to the end, the more bored I got. I skipped over some pages to get to the end. I didn't care about the character's fates. I just wanted to say i finished it.",0
"The first three books were great.  The fourth  one was lacking and I had hoped that this fifth one would redeem the fourth book by being as good as the first three- it did not.Describing things, places, men that have been described by the author before a hundred times- gets old.  The descriptions take me nowhere that I haven't already been or want to go.  Entire chapters about people that I don't care about, or that I didn't come to like as well as the characters who've been conveniently killed so things will become a little more simple, these chapters pretty much are worth skipping or browsing- looking for quotation marks and key words that may have something to do with someone who is interesting.Anyway, if there are going to be seven of these books, I guess that I can wait five years for the next one and I'll probably buy it and read it.  I read that Robert Jordan series and that was trying.  There's always Moby Dick, I haven't read that in a while.",0
"Next to Kay's later works, this one stinks.  I stopped somewhere under 100 pages. The characters are loosely conceived.  Their behavior and dialogue are stilted.",0
"I'm a huge fan of ASOIAF (and the HBO series), to the extent that I've had to buy multiple copies of the earlier books because I've worn them out from re-reading. Luckily (I think!) for me, I picked up the series between ASOS and AFFC, so I haven't been left with *as* unbearable a wait as some others.With ADWD, many of the problems that spawned out of splitting the planned fourth book into AFFC and ADWD (some of which were already present in the last book) have become hard to ignore and detract greatly from the overall reading experience. Not every novel needs to have the breathless pace and constant action of A Storm of Swords, but both AFFC and - especially - ADWD suffer from a languid pace that leaves you wondering ""when is something going to happen?"" more than ""what will happen next?"".It was nice to see some of the characters left out of AFFC again, although I can't say I was all that pleased with what we did get. Tyrion's travelogue through Essos could have been interesting had it (1) not been so drawn out and (2) not felt quite so contrived with running into a certain character in Volantis to continue his story. It's nice to get some world-building (unlike many people I see post, I'm actually very interested in knowing more about Essos), but it just doesn't work when you spread Tyrion's journey across an entire, huge, book to do so (especially compard to the more reasonable way travel was dealt with in, say, AGOT, when Catelyn can get around Westeros without needing the entire book to do so).Dany reappears but, well, her character and storyline are both rather stagnant until her last couple of chapters where...well...it's not that significant things happen so much as it seems like they're *about* to happen. Small victories, I guess. Theon returns (he lives!), and probably is the most compelling PoV character in the book. He's not really on a redemption arc, but his psychological sufferings are quite vivid and the goings-on in the North are probably the book's strong point on top of it. I wish I could say the same for the Wall, but while it was good to see Jon suffer some consequences for his decisions, many of his chapters felt rather repetitive (someone comes in to tell him some advice, Jon ignores it, Jon deals with wildlings, repeat). Brienne, though figuring significantly in AFFC, is present but her appearance feels extremely tacked on and without any real purpose other than to set up a cliffhanger.What else? Well, there's the multiple cliffhangers that, while dramatic at first, are now tiresome (Brienne returns from one cliffhanger to exit in another, ugh), the excessive description of traveling, food, urination, sex, etc. that - while providing a lot of detail of the world the story takes place in, does little to actually move the story forward. Repetitive phrases (where do whores go?, etc.) are introduced, descriptions we've heard ten thousand times are back (did any of you know the Sand Snakes are deadly? that they might hide poison or knives in their clothes?), and the book as a whole feels more like it's about putting people in place than anything else. As an aside, it's fitting Areo Hotah appears as a PoV character again in ADWD because he's the same; just there so we can see Doran but offering basically nothing aside from it.Now, if you've actually read some/most/all of this mini-rant, you may be wondering what I liked about the book. Frankly, I'm feeling a bit tired of my own ponderous writing at this point, so I'll use bullets.(1) Theon, Davos, the political situation in the North in general(2) Aegon Targaryen(?), though I admit he should have been introduced earlier probably and I also liked his chapters because they provided much needed action.(3) Wyman Manderly(4) The Melisandre PoV was a good example of how to give a PoV to a character to flesh them out and not simply to relay plot details (plus Melisandre's role is interesting)Despite my complaints above, I feel like we've finally trudged through AFFC and ADWD and the series is in a position where a sense of 'normalcy' can return - the characters in Essos are all more or less positioned where they need to be to meet Dany, in particular. I just wish the journey to get there had been more engaging and worthwhile.",0
"I've read hundreds of thrillers, and this one started out relatively slowly, I almost gave it up in the first hundred pages because it seemed like it was just plodding along, but the writing was good so I kept at it.The middle got really good, the writer was really rounding out the character and all the pots put on to simmer got boiling (the neighbor was a bit obvious, the reader never thinks he's wholly who he seems to be, the only question is who is he spying on Stephanie for, but it's a nice touch), he sets up a jim-dandy climax at the end inside the airplane...... then kicks you in the gut with an ending as credible as a Hamas press release.  You feel completely cheated, realizing that he's set you up for 400+ pages for a thin, limp little pro-Palestinian terrorist screed, he's sacrificed any credibility his character had (which was quite a lot, the scenes with Iain Boyd are wonderfully written) for the sake of jihadist PR, and you can quite understand why so many of his books, all published quite recently, seem to be out of print.  After being jerked around so badly and clumsily by the ending I'm certainly never going to read or buy anything else he writes.And it's not just his political viewpoint, if the positions were reversed it would still be the most fake, insulting, unreal ending outside of a North Korean propaganda film.  Shame, since once he got going this book was really well-written.  Lilies that fester, however -- had the main character been any less believably drawn you wouldn't feel so lied to at the end.",0
"Tyrion escapes across the sea, crosses an entire continent, discovers a long lost secret...and nothing happens.  Daenerys rules over Meereen, fends off eager suitors, discovers a deep-seated desire for sofa cushions...and nothing happens.  Jon commands the Nights Watch, defends the Seven Kingdoms from the cold, worries about groceries...and nothing happens.  Words ARE Wind and GRR Martin is full of it.",0
"Unlike many who have reviewed this book, descriptions of barley porridge and bends sinister don't put me off. In fact, I think many fantasy writers neglect the basics of medieval life whilst they stroke their immense swords. I'm also not one of the readers who get all self-righteous because an author takes too long to write a book. It's his living, his book and I am a paying customer, not an investor.Having said that, I was still somewhat disappointed by this latest instalment for basically the same reason outlined by others who have reviewed it: lack of progress.The key POV character storylines advance very little throughout the novel. Indeed, what little advancement they do make seems somewhat negated by the end points of the threads at the close of the book. Meanwhile, other threads just seem to vaporise and some of the new ones that are introduced are rendered somewhat pointless by their climaxes.In other words, the book seems about 95% padding and 5% substance.The use of journeys, both physical and mental, for so many of the characters is part of the problem. The plot lines become like so many tedious car trips. You watch the scenery roll past to the point of boredom, hoping against hope that there will be something of interest in the next town you enter. Only to realise that the next landmark is fairly much the same as the last.Of course Martin does throw in some of his trademark surprises at the end, but they're starting to become contrived. Worse still, the reappearance of some characters we thought killed now makes anyone else's apparent demise less certain. Like when Indiana Jones goes over a cliff and you just know that he's not going to fall to his death because, well, he's the *hero*.All up I won't give the book one star because it's still a very richly written piece of work. But it's not worth the price I paid for it on pre-order. Perhaps the worst condemnation I can give it is that if you did not read this book, I imagine that you could pick up the next one in the series and not have any trouble following the story.",0
"But the best sleep aid I've ever found.  After reading the reviews, I thought I'd really like this book.  But the plot development is glacial, the character's so pendantic, that out of sheer determination I finished the book (and find the obvious ending that bad guy Holt dies and Angus kills him and the world is saved and Morn gets a medal and a pardon- no, can't make this bad stuff up).My advice. If you are interested in this bloated book, read every 20th page.  I kid-you-not that you miss nothing other than time wasted from your life.Obviously the author was paid by the word.  If one would suffice, twenty were used....Do NOT buy this book unless you have no imagination and have eons of time to kill in worthless pursuit of entertainment.If I could rate this ""book"" a zero, I would...I HATED THIS BOOK!",0
I found the book to be drawn out.  Did not enjoy reading it as much as the first book.  The book looses its intrigue.  Will not be buying the other two books that follow on Dance of Dragons.  Will rather watch the TV series Game of Thrones.,0
"I never thought I'd be writing this review. I once considered myself a fervent fan of the A Song of Ice and Fire series. I started reading the series about a decade ago, when it consisted of three novels. Since then, GRRM has managed to add a grand total of two books. The plot's forward momentum has ground to a halt as beloved, well-developed characters are unceremoniously killed off and replaced with vapid, one-dimensional pawns who are coldly maneuvered on the ever-shifting chessboard of Westeros (and now the Free Cities).It's not hard to say what went wrong. Martin, quite simply, pulled a Jordan. Too many characters, too many subplots; too little editing and focus on core conflicts. There's nothing offensive in comparing him to Robert Jordan: those who award 3 stars or less to this book are fans, or former fans, who wanted to see the series end as strongly as it began. We don't say this out of spite; we say it out of disappointment with something we once loved. We would not have read five books deep--including the mediocre A FEAST FOR CROWS--if Martin hadn't earned our devotion and good will by doing *something* right in those first three books.In two months I've read a quarter of ADWD and even that much required a massive effort of will. The plot is going nowhere. I am tired of reading about Davos, Daario, Griff and Young Griff, and all the other meaningless minor characters and subplots while Tyrion, Jon, and Dany spin their wheels. I'm tired of the once-fresh device of killing off sympathetic main characters turning into a gimmick. I'm tired of prose that reads like a dry travelogue of Old Valyria, listing the flora and fauna of the region, including types of river turtles, the precise width of bodies of water and their tributaries, and other similarly riveting subjects. At this point I'm just waiting for Martin to start describing the embroidery on a shawl or the cream color slashing a blue silk dress.I'm tired of hearing ""the tale grew in the telling."" It's an excuse. The tale didn't grow; the editing shrank.Martin is clearly floundering, unsure of how to proceed. As I read about Tyrion wallowing in self-pity, Dany losing her wits, and Jon bumbling around aimlessly, I can't help but see them as metaphors for their creator.Books 4 and 5 of ASoIaF should not have been written. Martin should've embraced the boldness that made him famous for beheading dear old Ned and made the jump to five years in the future. Skip the setup; cut straight to the good stuff. I hope Books 6, 7, and possibly (probably) additional titles will return to the glory of the original three, but I'm honestly not sure I'll be there to read them. The good will Martin built up with the first three books in the series has been systematically squandered with a decade's worth of waiting for the monumental disappointments that were AFFC and ADWD.Meanwhile, back to slogging through encyclopedia entries about Meereenese political customs and shipbuilding practices from the Narrow Sea region...",0
"The first three books in this series are a wonderful reinvention of a tired genre, the epic fantasy novel. Many have compared Martin to Tolkein in the process, and it's true that they have each invented a complete Otherworld, real and yet alien, filled with acutely realized characters.But Martin stumbled in Book Four, and falls in this, Book Five in the series.There's some good here. Thankfully, Tyrion is back, and Arya continues to be a complex and enigmatic character. Some of the intrigue on the Wall, with winter falling, is gripping. When the dragons eventually appear, they are as fearsome as dragons should be.But much of the rest of this book is dull nonsense (please fans, don't flame me!). It goes on, and on, and on, and on. I skipped pages of filler. Many of the plot-turns feel false and hurried. In the final chapters the book falls apart. There are so many incidental characters it becomes pointless to try and follow the numerous sub-plots that in any event aren't interesting. I could go on, but I'd be committing Martin's sin of saying far too much over and over again.What happened, Mr Martin???",0
"With this latest book Martin has found a steady predictable pattern. It goes like this:Stalling, stalling, stalling , stalling, interesting, boring, stalling, stalling, exciting (a few paragraphs, not a chapter), boring, boring, boring, stalling, interesting, boring, stalling, stalling, exciting (again only a few paragraphs), boring, boring, boring, stalling, stalling, stalling, depressing, depressing, depressing.You come to realize that when something exciting happens, you will turn the page, the chapter will end abruptly and you will be whisked away to the most boring threads he has, even if he has to make a few new irrelevant threads to do it.What I have come to realize is that my initial expectations were wrong. I expected an epic adventure, but Martins intent does not seem to be to write a ""story"" in the usual sense. That is to say, it isn't meant to have a beginning a middle and an end. There is no character who comes from humble beginnings, works through his trials and saves Westeros in the end. What Martin is writing is more like one of those generational dramas. The characters mill about and then die and their sons and cousins mill about and then die. The value in this type of book is that it gives you a thorough look at life in an interesting time and place, but they are seldom what I would call entertaining.If I had known this would be a generational drama instead of an epic adventure I would not have bothered in the first place. Martin can be a great writer when he wants to, but he is in desperate need of a strong editor who can help him with plotting and pacing. I will not be buying the next books when they come out. Instead, if by some miracle he lives long enough to finish them all, I will have a look at the final chapters and decide then if there is enough payoff to justify sludging through the final books.",0
"I'd heard that Patterson was a bad writer, but I wasn't prepared for the true impact of his shoddy, grade-school prose. The story is plodding, kept alive only by single-word paragraphs and two-page chapters. The line-by-line writing is juvenile and the story developments - such as a split-personality killer being hypnotised in court - feels more like a parody of a psychological thriller than a NYT best seller. Avoid.",0
"On p. 442, Marshall writes, ""Georges Sorel, inspired by by Proudhon and the syndicalists, maintained in his Reflections on Violence (1908) that class war invigorates society. He opposed 'bourgeois force', arguing that the latter has a purifying effect that enables people to take possession of themselves. The general strike moreover is of value as a 'social myth', an article of faith which inspires the workers in their struggle. For Sorel, social myths are important since they are 'not descriptions of things, but expression of a determination to act'. Although he later influenced Lenin, Mussolini and Action Franaise, he did not object to acknowledging himself an anarchist since 'Parliamentary Socialism professes a contempt for morality' and the new  ethic of the producers.""Mr Marshall, as a historian of anarchism, seems to share their indifference to facts.Sorel did not influence Lenin. Lenin called Sorel `the well-known advocate of confusion'. The Marxist historian of philosophy George Lukacs referred to Sorel's `totally insubstantial theory of myth'. So it is a bit of a stretch for Marshall to write that Lenin was influenced by Sorel.This mistake is typical of this unreliable book. It is careless of the facts, even about its subject, and still more unreliable about any other politics.",0
"PROS: Realism, distinct characters.CONS: Slow-moving, too political, unlikable characters, repetitive descriptions.BOTTOM LINE: I was looking for a ""Sense of Wonder"" and was left with a ""Sense of What For?""How was I to know that it was a book about politics, economics and sociology disguised as Science Fiction?I had hope for the book in the beginning.  I really enjoyed ""The Voyage Out"" and the character development (even though, for me, the characters were not very likable).  When they got to Mars, the book seemed to slow way down.  The same features of Mars are explained over and over again.  The author only has to tell me once that the sand/cliff/mountain/sky/terrain is red/rust/orange/crimson/brown/tan...I get it already!  I do agree with other reviewers who say that 150-200 pages of describing Mars could have been left out to make a much more enjoyable book.The parts about the colonization were technically interesting, but overpowered with political issues (not a favorite SciFi topic of mine).  While I think the events were a realistic expectation for people under such a situation, it just makes for very dry reading.  And after all, I'm reading fiction for its entertainment value, not for it's educational value.",0
"The first 4 books, all well written, came to no conclusions, except for the characters that were killed off. -- This book isn't as well written - revealed very little story and less conclusions to the story began.  The whole thing feels like a ploy to make more money, without offering any reader satisfaction. - I have to confess that having read over two thousand of Martins pages, and being a real GoT fan (computer games,TV series, etc.)it was all a gigantic disappointment - but at least I won't be looking forward future books of his, I was a sucker, but I'm done.",0
"este libro es excelente para atajar una puerta o para hacer ejercisios, junto con otros libros malos para levantamiento de pesas. la trama parece la de una pelicula de esas que se ven para esperar que a uno le de sueno.  un presidente que tiene que tomar el mando despues de que el gobernante  actual es asesinado con todo y gabinete, una trama de unos arabes, es  aburridisimo y mas porque el autor se lo toma todo tan en serio y termina  creyendose su historia. ademas el libro es excesivamente largo, no lo  termine, con cada pagina me iba a burriendo mas y finalmente despues de  usarlo como banquito, termine regalandoselo a una profesora amiga que es  fanatica de tom clancy, asi que creo que lo deje en buenas manos.LUIS  MENDEZ luismendez@codetel.net.do",0
"Good novel, but extremely poorly published......at least in the Kindle edition.

"It might be fun to speculate about what history might have been like if .... . But this book is different. It confirms all - mainly British - prejudices about Germany and - this is unfair - makes the US part of it. Only Great Britain seems to be the root of democracy. It might have slipped Easterman's mind that the English invented the concentration camps when they fought against South Africa's independence. And they fought against a lot of peoples who wanted to be independent from the Great British Rule. I have always been a fan of Easterman's. But this novel is really bad, its plot lousy, its characters ludicrous. And his German is even more ridiculous. His worst novel.",0
"I haven't read much Clancy since I was a teen reading Red Storm Rising which I liked a lot.  This book however was a disappointment.  First of all there's too many different stories happening at once.  It's got spy tales and intrigue (a left wing activist and his KGB contacts), police procedural with Det. Ryan (Jack Ryan's dad), Mafia connections and drug dealing, the usual high tech military aspects with all the jargon, and a long drawn out POW rescue attempt in Vietnam. By far the worst and main story is of Navy Seal/CIA recruit superhero John Kelly/Clark and his bloodthirsty goal of revenge.John's wife was killed in a tragic car accident 6 months earlier and so he picks up a skinny and beat down looking hitchhiker off the street and takes her to his boat.  Almost immediate she pushes him down onto the deck and makes love to him. There is supposedly a connection because each sees each others pain and suffering and understands each other.  She doesn't mind that the blood type of at least three different men must still be inside her from the previous night of being treated like a dog by her pimps and drug pushers before she escaped.  Well soon she is killed and Kelly goes on his revenge rampage by just sneaking up to drug pushers dressed as a drunken hobo and shooting them point blank.  Sometimes he doesn't even ask any questions of them yet he always knows where to go to next.  After one double homicide, Kelly is escaping the scene when he sees a nurse being threatened with a knife by a kid who wants money.  He quickly dislocates the kids shoulder takes his knife and drives it through his skull.  Eventually, he gets all the bad guys and suffers no consequences.  In fact he gets a job at the CIA.In Clancy's Vietnam, all the aviators and POWs are of course heroes and the Vietnamese are routinely referred to through most of the book as little monkeys, and little yellow cowards, brutal child rapists and so on.  I would have like to have heard some more honesty here.  He could mention something about the US propping up a Latin American style terror regime in S. Vietnam.  The bombing of S. Vietnam, the use of chemical warfare  on the land to drive the people into concentration camps and the eventual spread of this war all over to N. Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos.  The US dropped more bombs on Cambodia for instance than the entire Allied forces during the entire second world war.  The only character who seems to know this is going on is portrayed as a leftist pot smoking traitor who is forced to commit suicide by Kelly.  This book kinda makes me sick the more I think about it and I shall not go on.  I know Clancy supports right wing ideology and sometimes is on right wing radio and TV and with this book makes porn for the right.  With that said as long as you know this is fantasy and fiction it's ok, because there are good parts to the book.  I mostly focused on the bad because I don't want people to think this is realistic or that the world works like this or that everything is in black and white. For a more realistic perspective of the drug trade on the street level watch the series The Wire and grow some sympathy for people who are trying to survive in a different way of life from you before you cheer some fantasy right wing superhero murdering them.",0
"I can't say it any better than some of the other reviewers already have said it. The author has lost his way, developed too many characters that we don't care about, and spent too many words saying nothing.I wish I had not spent the money and much more importantly the time on this book. This author is too busy writing cookbooks and blogging about football, he should turn the franchise over to someone else so they can at least finish the stories. We read books to escape not to be tortured.Also - the american tolkein? Really? The way these last 2 books have been, they really are just rated M or NC17 soap operas.SPOILER ALERT:Cliffhangers that simply do not get resolved (e.g. Brienne, how did she get out of being hung? - thought it would be resolved in this book? WRONG).Seige by Stannis, and then it's over with NO DETAILS. Wow. Big twist with the onion knight. He's dead, he's not dead - in the end who cares nothing happens. Just a huge waste of time.",0
"1000 pages of endless dithering.  Dany has three dragons but can't bring herself to work with them.  Too many different characters doing different things with little story cohesion.  Just when a chapter actually gets going it ends and you are back to food descriptions, sailing, marching, back story...There is little development of Bran and Arya, both were fascinating possibilities but he just teased us with them.And not an Other in sightAnd the end?  Was the worst part. Made me angry. No more of my money  will I spend Mr Martin has lst his way. Good stories have a beginning a middle and an end.  He is just milking us now like Terry Brooks and Robert Jordan.",0
"I knew that this book was GGK's first, and I also knew it concerned the cliched fantasy theme of downtrodden Good guys must somehow defeat the powerful Bad guys. But I was really hoping that with Kay's superior writing evident in Tigana, the Summer Tree would also be similar in enjoyability. Alas... it was not not. I only got halfway thru it, before I had to set it aside, unable to get interested in it. Mundane names like Kevin and Kim and Paul and Dave mixed in with fantasy names like Loren Silvercloak and Diarmuid and Eilathen and Ailell just didn't work for me. I think the part that really did me in though, was during a scene where somebody explains about how ...&quot;the wolves have been coming down from the North. And these are BIG wolves...&quot; C'mon, how many times have we all read that scene during years of reading fantasy?I will definitely give Kay credit though, since these are his first published books. And of course he was influenced by JRR via the Silmarillon that he helped re-construct. Not a bad book I guess, but after reading Tigana, I expect much more than this re-canned plot. I will probably read A Song for Arbonne or The Lions of Al-Rassan next.",0
"despite it's popularity, this series gets worse and worse with each succeeding book. the last volume is so disjointed and unsatisfying that it spoiled the first two which weren't bad.",0
"same as what everybody else said.  this story would have made a great 5-book series, but at this point he's just stringing us along for no good reason.  there's an art to writing an epic series like this, and part of that is making each book feel both self-contained and part of a whole at the same time.  this one feels more like a place-holder.  it's a shame that there are so many plot lines here, and that, rather than move any particular character one foot forward, he instead moves a dozen different characters forward an inch.",0
"We, Your loving and concerned fans, want the good stuff back! Give us the good old action packed ""song of ice and fire"" we so loved and got addicted to for the first 3 installment!Are you Robert Jordan, Master of BORE, Or the acclaimed GRR Martin, creator of worlds, master of intrigue, emperor of suspense?If you read most of the reviews here you'll find all the reviewers say the same things -  a very very long book, with almost no plot.Boring. Tedious. superfluous. Are those the words you want to be associated with your creation?What started out as one of the most thrilling, exiting, and enjoyable fantasy series, took a dive down, leaving millions of fans bitterly disappointed. We  want to be able to read on and see what happens. lead us through this epic tale you created, make us again love and hate, cry and lough, and read with wonder what magnificent and thrilling adventures are installed for your characters. Do not let it end this way.Make ""Feast for crows"" and ""Dance of dragons""  just a bad dream you woke from, and write us the book we are waiting for.Join me in telling  Mr. Martin to deliver the goods: Do not buy this book. Nothing much happens there, you are not missing out.If you must read it - borrow it from a library or from someone who waisted his money already.  Resist the urge to buy, I know it is difficult sometimes - but it will serve a good cause. Maybe if the sales of this book will be considerably lower, Mr. Martin will understand that he has let down his fans, and that he needs to give them the terrific sixth installment they are waiting for.I am not a crazed fun. I can go on with my life with or without the 7 kingdoms, but a decent sequel and a worthy ENDING would be nice, too.I mean - I love an epic saga, but how long can it go? Don't the devoted readers deserve a closure?  It appears to me that Mr. Martin does not seem to think so. Maybe he does not have a clue as how to end it, or maybe he thinks we are walking, talking ATM machines.If he does intend to end it, with the brilliance and magic he knows to weave, let it happen now. If this is the best he can do - Why would you give him your money? How can a book this disappointing, that has made so may people give up entirely on the series, be on the best sellers list?I have posted this exact same review/protest for GRRM's ""Feast for crows"". In my opinion - these two books are basically the same long, endless,  less than mediocre book, That should not have been written.  The two were just too thick to bind together and I guess that making the readers pay for two bad books instead of just one appealed to Mr. Martin and his publisher.",0
"This is the weakest book of his I have read, and that is about thirty MacLean novels.  I understand that he passed away prior to this book being  published and that is was compiled posthumously.  While admittedly not all  of his books are great, I don't feel this is up to snuff with any of the  others.  Don't make this your first MacLean book and unless you feel the  desire to read every one of his books like I choose to, take a pass on it.  I am unwilling to touch any of the Alistair MacNeill books written using  MacLeans notecards because I feel those are apt to be pretty weak too, and  no one ever seems to duplicate the originals.  If you are going to give a  couple of MacLean novels a try, go for &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot;,  &quot;Puppet on a Chain&quot;, &quot;Bear Island&quot;, &amp; &quot;Ice  Station Zebra&quot;.",0
"Tom Clancy probably wrote this on a ship in his early 20s.  It's a great example of a first novel, and how much better an author can become.

I started it, shelved it, read three books, went back to it and I just could not foster up enough interest to continue reading.  The story line is uninteresting and the characters were dull. I finally accepted that I would not likely ever to read it; so I tried to sell the book back to the store. The book store did not accept it because this item was not moving from the shelves!  It was definitely not worth the money I spent on this item.",0
"This is a disgusting book in my opinion. The author is way too graphic in descriptions, just not necessary. That and the profanity seems to be the basis for the book, no depth in it. Would not recommend.",0
"This is the fifth book I have read by Lisa Scottoline. I was disappointed in it. I enjoyed the others. This one had to many things going on at one time, it was almost like trying to read five or six different stories at the same time. There would be a chapter about Marta, then one about the jury, then one about City Hall, then one about Steere, then one about Judy and Mary, then she would start over again with Marta. The material on Marta at the beach house of Steere was a joke, I know it is fiction but for Marta to do what she did in that much cold and snow is so far out it is unreal. I had really looked forward to reading this book as I enjoyed the others so much. Don't know if I will try another one or not.",0
"I love the Berenstain Bears, but this book stinks.  This is the only book of theirs that I rank low.  I grew up with the Berenstein Bear's books and love their illustrations and messages, but this one lacks in content and craftsmanship.  Buy every other Berenstein Bear book out there but skip this one.",0
"Extremely insulting that no one ever proof reads books after conversion to kindle format.  While the kindle edition appears to have undergone some clean up after so many negative reviews for a chapter to have ""Bearl Barbor"" as the title is beyond belief.  There are many other conversion errors with improper character recognition but I did not track those.  A few problems with hyphenation also remain where the printed edition used hyphenation as a means to word/line wrap but the after conversion to kindle the hyphen is no longer appropriate since the line wrap occurs at a different point in the line.  There are a few graphics from the printed version also scanned into the kindle edition and therefore of poor quality.  Can only imagine how bad War and Remembrance kindle edition must be since that title has been unavailable for many months while awaiting correction.",0
"I just finished DoD and I truly feel like it was a waste of time. I loved the first 3 books, thankfully I read the reviews about a Feast of Crows and wasn't too disappointed  by the fact that a lot of the characters I had invested in were no where in the book. I also read the reviews for this book, and bought it, and skimmed, skimmed, skimmed - oh read about Theon, skimmed, skimmed, read a bit about Arya, skimmed over all the useless filler, no forward moving dialogue- ugh just boring! What happened? How could the first 3 books be SO GOOD, and the last 2 so poor?",0
"I have read the series this far, so I am a fan. And only a dedicated fan should read this book. I love Martin's writing, but I have to say that this is by far the worst book he has written. Where were the editors? It's way too long and it fails to advance the story more than a millimeter. You could read the first chapter and the last chapter and skip everything in the middle, because nothing happens! Well, it does, but somehow it all seems very boring and predictable. The copy editing is sloppy with errors in grammar and overuse of the same words and phrases.This book should have been released as two books. Then the first book would have been released sooner, it would have been shorter and the publisher would make twice a much money. The fans would be happy and the author not so burned out. I hope the next book is shorter, tighter and more eventful.",0
"Bleaah. Another of Lorenza de Medici's big, unwieldy books of gorgeous pictures of Italian scenery paired with mediocre recipes.The text, not written by de Medici, has several silly errors, saying that sugar cane came from the New World and pumpkins from the Old, which is backwards.The recipes are better than in some of her other cookbooks, where we were treated to a gorgeous picture of, for example, croque monsieur, which isn't Italian and isn't really a recipe.But not much better. Vegetarians might go for many of them, since they are supposed to be from the peasant kitchens, where meat was, until recently, seldom seen. Yet the recipes are dull enough. Steamed asparagus topped with butter and lemon is, indeed, a fine dish, but not really a recipe.The food illustrations are punk, well under the gorgeous picture of croque monsieur, for example.The full page pictures of Italy are superb, though, if you like that sort of thing.",0
"The books feels like the author was writing it while she was running on the treadmill, sometimes things speed up so quickly you can tell the author just got really sick of the segment and wanted to move on with the storyline. It renders the main romance somewhat rushed and insincere, at least that's how I felt. Characters who have known each other for a very short time share passion and requited love for one another, vowing to be together forever when one of whom is still married.Some details like the villain being Jewish are completely impertinent to the story but makes you why exactly the author did that. The protagonist is lovable and portrayed in very positive light throughout the novel, but his actions are just as villainous and psychotic. At one point where the protagonist gets really jealous he climbs on the roof of a moving train while carrying a knife in his mouth, intending to kill the villain in a very really Indiana Joneseque segment that makes you giggle at how superficial the author's line of thought was.Without revealing too much, it's very close to Moulin Rouge, only without the interest, tempestuous music and theatricality. If you enjoy sappy romance novels you'll like it.",0
"The first three books were great.  They moved and I couldn't put them down.  Book four was a disappointment, slow pace and not a thing about DT who was one of the most interesting characters.  ""Dances With Dragons"" is a disingenuous title...not much DT here either and not much about dragons either.  I had anticipated this book with high hopes only to be sorely disappointed and the only thing draggin' was the pace.  If the next one takes years I'm not sure I'll remember to read it.",0
"I've just been notified by Amazon that the paperback release date for this book has been pushed back AGAIN, this time until September of 2014.  Absolutely ridiculous that it will take at least three and a half years to get a paperback to market, and for people who like their series to be in the same format, a hard cover is not an option.  Order cancelled.",0
"In There is a Tide, Poirot remarks to Superintendent Spence that it's always the human interest that gets him. I think that is what I like so much about Agatha Christie's books - her incisive and almost brutal analyses of all the people in her books. This is especially well achieved in her books about murders within families. Unfortunately, that's also what this book lacks.Passenger to Frankfurt seems to be Agatha Christie's attempt to write a thriller. I am not sure how many of these non-murder mystery books she's written; this is the first one I've read. It follows a global conspiracy to control the world, reviving Nazism along the way. The protagonist is a British diplomat, who is aided by a beautiful female spy.The book features some traditional Christie trademarks, like the couple falling in love, and some incisive commentary about the players in the conspiracy. However, most of it felt muddled and incomprehensible, and a little dated. I think Christie's brand of sensationalism works really well for small towns, but doesn't translate well to global events. I also didn't really understand how each event led to the next, and there were way too many characters introduced, so I couldn't keep track of who was who. The narrative wasn't cohesive, with viewpoints being switched erratically.I'd stick to Christie's murder mysteries.",0
"I remember when Cecil B. Demille directed a behemoth circus film called ""The Greatest Show On Earth"" in the early 50's.  It had such spectacle, and what a star-studded cast headed by the great Jimmy Stewart, Cornel Wilde, Betty Hutton...it was, just, well, awful.  Yes, AWFUL.  And ya know, Hollywood decided to give this giant piece of piffle the year's BEST PICTURE Oscar.  I mean, it really makes you wonder why people (uh, powerful people, that is), go to the trouble of praising something that's not worth the price of admission.  Could it be....to make the film more profitable???  Could it be....money, money, and hopefully more money????  To gush and fawn over something so abysmal, luring the public into conforming to the propogandic publicity, that it finally becomes a pseudo-masterpiece, not to be missed?Know what I mean?Because if you don't, then borrow (DON""T BUY!!), Sara Gruen's Best-selling monkey-poop called ""Water For Elephants"".  This is a book that may give the beginning writer hope and much needed optimism.  Repeat after me....""If Sara Gruen can be a published writer, then I can be a published writer"".  It's so easy you don't even have to develope characters to any great extent, as long as you have a skeletal outline of your story, just scribble it down and then decorate with some tacky sex so it doesn't fall into the children's market.  Make sure the story is narrated too, but make sure it's just about as pretentious a narration as you can dream up.  Then populate the text with various freaky deaky characters and situations....like animal torture and alcoholism.  Then let the 'big boys' market it for you and wait for the film, that will hopefully have an all-female cast.  I mean, who cares?",0
"I pre-ordered ADWD and I repurchased and reread the first four books.ADWD SUCKS!!!!! AHHHHH! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!! This book was SUCH a disappointment.Let's be clear, I enjoy Mr. Martins' writing style. His depth of character, wicked twists, breathtaking descriptions and a world that is unique and realistic.However, this particular book SUCKED BEYOND ALL THAT HAS EVER SUCKED BEFORE!!! I feel that this book is a stalling tactic for the HBO series to pull new fans into the series (AND the next two books) in order to make as much money as possible. I think Mr. Martin is fully aware of the suckyness of ADWD, and as a fan all I can do is SMDH. Shame on you Mr. Martin! It could still be good even if it was just a place holder!This book was a drag, a bunch of new characters I DO NOT CARE ABOUT (I have been trained by Mr. Martins previous 4 books not to care too much for any character as they may be killed off at the drop of a dime) I was bored with all the traveling here and sailing there and eating locusts and puppies and other nasty stuff, and still not tying up any conflicts, old or new, just creating more and more and more conflicts. Enough is enough. I first started the series 2001 and I am too through! I have also told all my friends and family who I bragged and bragged to about this series to that it is a big fat waste of time. I am selling my books to a newbie to the series. They won't know any better. SMDH.",0
"I have been a huge fan of GRRM's Song of Ice and Fire Series.  Admittedly, A Feast for Crows had come as a disappointment.  But Martin had an explanation for that.  He reported on his web site that he had disagreements with the publisher about the scope and content of the book.  When I learned that A Dance with Dragons would finally be released this summer I felt confident that Martin would not disappoint his fans again and that he would deliver a novel that was worthy of the first three books in this series.  I anticipated spending a few weeks of the summer by the pool with this hefty tome in my hand.It turned out to be a big disappointment and I have put it aside several times to read other things that I wanted to read.  I have finally finished it.  In the previous books in this series, events had unfolded slowly but they had always maintained a sense of tension and drama.  Unfortunately, things move forward so slowly in A Dance with Dragons that it causes the reader to lose patience.  His handling of Tyrian, one of the most interesting characters of the previous novels, was particularly disappointing.  Tyrian sets out to align himself with Daenerys.  But after hundreds of pages of his adventures and misadventures, he never makes it to her.  This is extremely unsatisfying.  I would rather have read hundreds of pages of Tyrion interacting with Daenerys.  Maybe GRRM plans this for the next novel.  But if you don't have anything exciting to say in this novel, why not just move to it immediately?The plot lines revolving around Jon Snow and Daenerys are somewhat more interesting and suspenseful.  Some of the plots surrounding attempts to poison and assassinate Daenerys did hold my interest for a while.  Jon Snow has always been my favorite character in the series because of his combination of nobility and complexity.  His election to Lord Commander of the Nightwatch and his interactions with Melisandre were also interesting at times.  But these story lines were not enough to overcome my overall frustration with the lack of movement in this novel and Martin's tendency to skip over some of the larger conflicts that have been brewing in the series.This novel was a disappointment but I don't think that the series has been irredeemably lost.  It's clear that Martin still loves his characters and, let's face it, so do we.  Otherwise we wouldn't be criticizing him so fiercely here.  I am just hoping that in the next novel there will be some more significant events and major resolutions and that the development of the characters will go hand in hand with the measured unfolding of the story.",0
"He fancies himself Tolkein, however he's just another wannabe even going so far as to add the second ""R"" to his name. He even borrows some things from LOTR for example his ""Kings Moot"" compared to Tolkeins ""Ent Moot"". Tolkein was smart keeping the story moving and ending it in three books. Martin will be lucky to finish in seven books if at all. The fourth book was very disappointing because what happened to all the characters?????? I gave it one star should be a 0 since I'm done now, I've lost interest and won't buy any more.",0
"""The Great Escarpment was strange country, cut by north-south canyon systems, marred by old craters, overrun by lava flows, broken into hummocks and karsts and mesas and ridges; and all of them on a steep slope, so that on top of any rock or prominence one could see far down to the north"" (408).The above quote is to give you a real taste of Red Mars. A very large percentage of the novel is devoted to landscape descriptions like this, or the science background to the geological/terraforming events. Perhaps you're looking into Red Mars for the same reason I chose to give it a read--it won some prestigious awards. Having just finished the book, I can say that it won those awards on the strength of the large amounts of research that obviously went into its creation.While I applaud those efforts as well, it is also possible that you're like me in that you're seeking a good story with an exciting plot and well-drawn, sympathetic characters. In those respects, Red Mars is quite a disappointment. The characters are fairly flat and, save for the ones that die, they essentially are the same from beginning to end. Further, none are particularly endearing; by the end, I did not care much what happened to them, or who succeeded, or who failed. The plot begins promisingly enough, but once past the first couple hundred pages it begins to meander off, neither building tension nor resolving anything.Part of the problems lie in the fact that the author wants his story to be ""epic."" Thus, he tells the story over several decades. The problem with this approach is that it distances us from the characters and the plot. There is no sense of immediacy. Also, it underlines the unchanging nature of the characters--surely someone could develop a new insight over thirty years? Further, the pacing is horrendous, punctuated as it is by all of the landscape details as noted above. The truth is that Mars does not have a particularly interesting landscape, being mostly rock and sand. The author tries his darndest to make it interesting, describing it at length, and he occasionally succeeds, but it just becomes frustrating after about page 300. As a parting slap, he makes the last 40 pages or so just about nothing *but* landscape description... sort of a final exam, I suppose. It is alienating and loses whatever interest the events in the story generate.Lastly to discuss is the philosophy of the piece. I got the impression, throughout, that the author is presenting two extreme sides of an issue (terraforming)--radical environmentalism (Ann) and radical, ""meddling"" science/humanism (Sax)--and saying that there must be some sort of compromise we can manage. The only real villain is capitalism (Phyllis/transnational corporations); otherwise, the author wants to be the voice of moderation. Sadly, the author displays very little real sympathy for any of the viewpoints presented and no understanding for those who would genuinely disagree with what he believes to be moderation (a strange form of socialism). His arguments will only seem right to you if you agree with him beforehand. The tone of the writing is clinical. Its prognosis for humanity, bleak.In all, I'm certain this book has an audience. After all, it has several glowing reviews here and did win those awards for some good reason, no doubt. It represents a mountain of research and, I am sure, painstaking work. Perhaps you are a part of its audience. I am not. The things I look for in a novel include exciting plots, engaging pacing and well-drawn, sympathetic characters who grow and change over the course of the story. This novel fails in those respects. There are two sequels but my journey ends here.",0
"I've loved every one of Martin's preceding books in this series.  Unfortunately, book five falls short of the excellence we've come to expect from the author.  Reading this book has been like talking to my mother-in-law on the phone.  That is to say, Martin goes on and on, in excruciating detail, about people and situations that have no apparent bearing on the real story.  This book is a long, tedious read.  I have yet to finish it, and I started it almost two months ago.  For an avid reader, that should speak volumes!I hope that he brings the story back around in book six and that it's not another disappointment.",0
"I never found a book that so accurately portrayed growing old and how you are treated. The story begins with life in the circus,",0
"I will try the next book in the series based on reviews, but this one was just too much for me.  I couldn't get past the rape stuff",0
"I consider myself ""ripped off"" after receiving this book. I should NOT have pre ordered...will not make this mistake again. This book seems to be edited out material that was thrown together to take advantage of the huge interest generated by the HBO series. I doubt the author ever meant to finish this series but saw the huge paycheck that he would get if he churned out another book. Last book I will buy from this author and last book I will ever preorder.",0
"A ""trilogy"" in seven or more (potentially) volumes, several thousand pages, and nothing really happens.  We waited how many years for this ""conclusion""???  I have lost all faith in Mr. Martin and in his ability to actually end a story.  The final pages of this book leave us with almost every interesting character either standing in a field, or half-way to a desired destination, wondering what comes next, or (even worse) suddenly killed without warning.  There is very little actual plot advancement from the end of Book Four.The Bible required only 2 ""Testaments"" to cover a great deal of material.  War and Peace managed to be complete in ONE volume.  Many, many great authors have created satisfying masterworks in Trilogies..  Originally planned to be a trilogy, this series was (apologetically) expanded to 4 volumes.. which still didn't reach a conclusion.  Then there were FIVE volumes, with a promised ""conclusion"" that didn't happen.  Now there are chapters of a SIXTH volume making their appearance, with hints that a SEVENTH volume may be necessary.  Where does it end?  How many years?  Will Brian Sanderson be asked to complete this series when another five volumes eventually seem to be required. and Mr. Martin has retired at the age of 150?  Will my great grandchildren still be alive when the final page is completed?  Will the TV series run even longer than ""The Simpsons""???  Give us a break, Mr. Martin!It seems far easier to create a bunch of interesting characters than to know what to do with them.  There are far too many characters in this series for anyone to expect the author to track them all the way to their ultimate goals, so Mr Martin solves the situation by many, many sudden deaths.  Still, it would have been pleasant to see the main characters eventually achieve some kind of goal.  Even two of the three dragons vanish from the storyline shortly after being introduced.The one star is for creating interesting characters.  Sorry that they are all, after all these years, left dangling or (at least temporarily) dead.",0
"It's true that historical fictional novels don't have to stick strictly to facts. But ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is completely unconvincing as a novel, not because of its sensationalism, exaggeration, and gross misrepresentation of historical facts, but the dubious characterisation of the two sisters. Mary is the innocent, sweet, moral heroine who is forced to become the King's mistress due to her family's hunger for power. Anne is the cold and calculating villain whose every word points to her monstrous greed and selfishness. The characters are very much one-dimensional, it's like reading a children's fairy tale about how a beautiful and kind heroine fights off the mean and ugly baddies.Gregory's idea of Mary narrating England's most famous historical affair is brilliant. She had an opportunity to write a brilliant masterpiece to both entertain and stimulate. Despite the popularity of the novel my personal reaction to TOBG is that it's tedious and distasteful. This book belongs in the soft porn section of stores rather than works of historical fiction. The dialogues are so vulgar and unrealistic as conversations of two upper-class sisters in the 16th century England. To me they sounded like something you'd read in a trashy magazine article by a prostitute who didn't pass high school English.",0
"It is very rare that I don't finish a book. I just couldn't find a single reason to continue reading; the writing style is that of a children's book - in a strange combination with graphic sex and 21st century profanity (both of which I don't mind in the right setting), the language doesn't match the 30ies, the cruelty to animals made me cringe, and the story was predictable.",0
"I couldn't stand this book.  Not only does it completely butcher history, it maligns Anne and makes her sister Mary look like a saint (when in fact she had also been a mistress to King Francis of France before coming to Eng. Court).  *SPOILERS*:  Gregory writes as if the accusations brought up against Anne (adultery, incest and witchcraft) are true (any historian will tell you Henry just wanted to make way for a new wife to bear him sons). *END SPOILERS*  Throughout the book I felt that she was really shoving down my throat that ""this is definitely a good person"" and ""this is definitely a bad person."" The characters are always very black/white and sinner/saint, ridiculously sweet/innocent and ridiculously conniving/evil (instead of letting each character have their own positives and negatives). No char development or depth.  PG tells you who to like instead of letting you decide for yourself.I think I would actually be able to tolerate/overlook (some of) the inaccuracies if the characters were actually developed and realistic, each having good points as well as flaws instead of them being just ""good"" and ""evil.""The majority of other authors will either (A) stick to the facts and actual events and create their characters and stories AROUND that. Or (b) it will be a completely made up story, set in a certain period with accurate detail as to daily life/events for that period. Or (c) there will be a few actual historical characters around which the story is set, but the story itself is complete fiction (ex Girl With A Pearl Earring). With b and c, the authors flat out tell you the story is fiction. With a, the authors usually write a note if they have left out/ignored a fact, purposely changed something in the story, or whether there are several theories as to what happened (and why they chose to go with whatever reason they ended up writing).The problem is that Philippa Gregory acts like she's writing A, claims she ""sticks to the facts"" when she actually ignores the majority of facts and instead of writing her books AROUND them, she writes OVER them (basically she's trying to re-write history). It's extremely frustrating to people who study history, are historians or people who just plain old really enjoy history that this author INSISTS that all of her books are based on fact.  In reality she completely ignores the majority of the facts, making her books mere skeletons of history - names, dates, marriages, births and deaths are correct (well, maybe not birthdates in this book, but you get my point), but other than that don't count on the rest of it. In some cases PG even makes up facts (she claims that she's SURE Anne Boleyn is guilty of at least one murder/poisoning, but offers no proof, and I don't think any of today's historians would agree that Anne was a murderer.  In fact Historians tend to distance themselves from PG books and PG herself because they don't want to be related to what is clearly utterly false).  And Ms. Gregory breaks the first rule of historical research, which is to USE PRIMARY RESOURCES.  When she actually does reference sources, they are secondary and usually have not stood up to the test of time or academic debate.  If PG admitted that she was changing historical facts to suit her stories, I think people would be more accepting, but unfortunately she claims her books are all Fact based and makes no notes in the text of the actual facts.",0
"Several reviewers have cited Mr. Cronin's readability - which is definitely a plus for this volume.  However, I didn't find his tone as neutral as did others.  It seemed a virtual panegyric of Napoleon, when compared with Frank McLynn's dispassionate tome.  I found Mr. Cronin's willingness to buy into much of Napoleonic apocrypha off-putting.  Impressive in its personal tone - it's obvious Mr. Cronin is interested & approves of the subject, however, I prefer a bit of objectivity to my history, as far as that is possible.",0
"So I just finished ploughing my way through all 5 of the Song of Fire and Ice books and I'm regretfully finding myself in agreement with many of the other reviews here.  Despite the breathless reviews posted on the back cover hailing George RR Martin as the ""American JRR Tolkein"" what he's shaping up to be is the next Robert Jordan.  This is not a good thing.Like the late Mr. Jordan whose Wheel of Time series was strung out horrifically, padded with useless new characters and endless descriptions of clothing, and basically milked for all the new volumes it could sell until the author lamentably died before he was anywhere close to a conclusion, the Song of Fire and Ice series is showing disturbingly parallel tendencies.  While the series started reasonably strong in the first book or two, by book 5 it's clear the author has no idea where he's going, doesn't know how to keep the plot moving anymore or even build suspense except by the soap-opera-like device of continually having characters you think he's killed off amazingly resurrected (sometimes off-stage so you have no idea how this actually occurred), and he still maddeningly pads out his prose with endless lists of clans and the heraldry of all those present at any event whether or not those people will actually play a part in the subsequent plot.And like Robert Jordan, it is looking as if the author is likely to expire before he can finish.  Even in his book jacket photo on Dance With Dragons (which would normally be expected to show the author in the most flattering light), Mr. Martin does not look well.  I am certainly not wishing any ill health on him, but I really wish he'd just get on with it and wrap up all the various plot lines in one final, climactic book.  Robert Jordan would have written a modern masterpiece if he'd had the willpower to make it a 6-book series; George RR Martin would be well-advised to do so.This is really a failure of editing.  It's an understandable problem - once an author becomes a wildly-successful bestseller, no editor has the power or the guts to say, ""George, this is a piece of long-winded crap that doesn't go anywhere.  Take it back and cut it by 50% and tighten up all the plotlines.""  But I guess they figure they'll sell a lot more books this way.As long as the author can survive the experience.Bottom line - I think I'll wait until I hear that the series has actually been completed before I purchase another volume.",0
"I really loved the series and was looking forward to the resolution of a lot things. No resolution. Also an epilogue that made me think the writer is saying, &#34;I'm done with this one.&#34;",0
"There are two specific reasons I rate this novel so low on the scale. First it is very long, tedious and at times laughable as far as plot and story line go. The characters are often cliche and difficult to take seriously and the scenes tend to be forced and come off as phony at best. Not present is the pins and needels descriptive narrative Clancy is so well known for. There are dozens of mistakes and errors and at times the plot gets away only to come back with an anti-climatic closure or worse, a very predictable one.Secondly without going as far as accusing Mr. Clancy of plagiarism, I will go as far as saying this story virtually mirrors that of Mack Bolan, the Executioner, written by Don Pendleton nearly 30 years ago. This is the story of the mysterious Mr. Clark who has so often come to the aid of Clancy's favorite protagonist, Jack Ryan. This novel is a prequel of several others in the Ryan series and attempts to explain who and what Clark is. Not only does it fail to do so, it takes a bit too much from the original Executioner novel. Worse, it doesn't have the gritty edge of Don pendleton's work and it is obvious it was written many years after the Vietnam war and the etire era it is supposed to depict. There are errors of detail and just plain poor development of the times and characters and their interactions.Read this one at your own risk or read it first to be more impressed with previous and latter offerings. Don'tlet it sour you on Tom Clancy's work. He is a great author, but this particular book is a disservice to his loyal readers.",0
"I actually bought this book years ago, but just got around to reading it when I saw that the movie was out. I had high expectations because of the press from the movie and from the many positive reviews. Unfortunately, few of my expectations were met.What I Like About This Book:It's the Circus. I love the sideshow era and just to read a book that was set in a Circus was entertaining.Easy read. Ending was fun, even if it was a little too neat.What I Did Not Like About This Book:Poor character development, especially the villains. It was obvious everyone hated August and Uncle Al, but not obvious why. Even when we finally see August at his worst, its too little too late. In fact, August loses his mind because he thinks his wife is sleeping with Jake, something that is not quite true yet, but definitely headed that direction. His actions are unjustified, but his anger seems entirely justified - his wife is already having an emotional affair with another man, and has already kissed him. The villains were never developed and because of that, the story was not nearly as engaging or suspenseful as it could have been. The hero also makes some odd decisions that don't match up with his character, like letting August beat the animals.True Love? Nope. Love story seemed contrived. Falls in love at first sight.Rosie the elephant was poorly developed as a character. Almost a background piece in the story.I really can't pinpoint exactly what it was about this book that didn't work, but it definitely didn't. The characters were poorly developed, the love interest and suspense contrived, and it was hard to care a lot about the elephant because we never really got to know her. It's a shame, because I love the idea, but it just did not cut it.If you want to read some great non-fiction about sideshows and entertaining attractions, check out Ricky Jay's books.

"Warning! These books are hypnotically attractive. The cover art is outstanding: excellent artwork for each, red motif for RED MARS, green motif for GREEN MARS, blue motif for BLUE MARS. At least BLUE MARS was a bestseller, and all three won prestigious awards. RED MARS won a Nebula for best novel, and GREEN MARS and BLUE MARS each won a Hugo for best novel. It is tempting to buy the whole set, which I did.And which I regret.The books have good parts, but you can get good parts in other books without having to wade through sludge. If you want to teach readers about Mars, write a book of nonfiction. If you want to write a story and take readers to places that cannot be reached in reality, then write fiction that is easy to read.These books have too much detail. The author elaborates too much. Many long paragraphs are tedious. Here is one from RED MARS:""Now she could wander in the dim ruby light of sunset, her old jazz collection piped from the habitat stereo into her helmet headphones, as she rooted in supply boxes and picked out any tool she wanted. She would carry them back to a small room she had commandeered in one of the storage warehouses, whistling along with King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band, adding to a collection that included, among other items, an Allen wrench set, some pliers, a power drill, several clamps, some hacksaws, an impact-wrench set, a brace of cold-tolerant bungie cords, assorted files and rasps and planes, a crescent-wrench set, a crimper, five hammers, some hemostats, three hydraulic jacks, a bellows, several sets of screwdrivers, drills and bits, a portable compressed gas cylinder, a box of plastic explosives and shape charges, a tape measure, a giant Swiss Army knife, tin snips, tongs, tweezers, three vises, a wire stripper, X-acto knives, a pick, a bunch of mallets, a nut driver set, hose clamps, a set of end mills, a set of jeweler's screwdrivers, a magnifying glass, all kinds of tape, a plumber's bob and ream, a sewing kit, scissors, sieves, a lathe, levels of all sizes, long-nosed pliers, vise-grip pliers, a tap-and-die set, three shovels, a compressor, a generator, a welding-and-cut set, a wheelbarrow--and so on.""This is the worst paragraph I could find, but it should help you to understand what I mean when I say these books are not easy to read.",0
The Game of Thrones peaked in book #3 for me.  These last 2 books have been dragging and not as exciting as the first three.,0
"The series has completely run out of steam.Fair warning, here be spoilers.George R.R. Martin continues to deliver excellent dialogue and sparkling prose, but his ""terror tactic"" writing (where he builds up a point of view character only to be cut-down in cold blood, e.g., Ned Stark, Rob Stark, Kevin Lannister, the Onion Knight, the King Beyond the Wall, et.al.) has finally produced the result that it is nearly impossible to care about any of George's characters.  (Why invest the emotional energy when the character is likely to die, no matter how improbable the reason?)  Neither the murder of the Onion Knight nor the murder of the King Beyond the Wall had to occur to promote the plot in DwD.The plot is soooooo plodding in DwD that you have to wonder if the purpose of the glacial pace is only to wring out another novel from a cash cow.  The filler pages go on and on and on about flora and fauna.Our Dragon Queen decides to hang out across the sea when given the opportunity (13 vessels) to go home and reclaim her birthright.  She also cages up her dragons (well, the two that she and her minions can fool or capture).What?!!?  While character development and change are important in great stories, this particular change seemed to be a pre-mature birth.It just makes the series drag on and on.When Tyrion falls off the side of the barge into the deadly water, I actually felt relieved, but, since Tyrion is George's alter ego in the series, the dwarf is improbably back a few chapters later.  (The means of recovering the dwarf that fell down into the murky river and was essentially drowned is glossed over in the book.)  Of course, George will just kill Tyrion off in the first chapter of the next book as a way of saying, ""nah-nah-boo-boo"" to his remaining readers.Jon Snow ends up helping out our usurper king too.  Why?  Who knows?And the god of the deep ends up being ... I can't even bear to tell you in the review; it is sooooo silly.Then, there is the Deus ex Machina and returned minor character at the end of the book who kills off K. Lannister.  The character's appearance is not so much a dramatic plot twist as a ""head scratcher.""  It completely destroys suspension of disbelief.  Also, the character, who was previously portrayed as completely amoral if not actually evil, now ""rides in on the white charger"" as the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.What?!?!?  Why?!?!?Actually, more to the point, it is hard to even care.I understand that the HBO mini-series was very good.Hopefully, if HBO gets to the point where the Feast for Crows and Dance with Dragons takes place, the playwrights will take significant liberties with the story.In service,Rich[...]",0
"I am an avid Victoria Holt fan, but The Silk Vendetta was not my cup of tea at all. The dialogue was stilted -- there was too much of it -- to much redundancy -- and in many places unbelievable. There was no consistency about who was going to be the hero in this story for so much was going on  and (without giving a spoiler) from the middle to the end Ms Holt took us all over the place. The daughter who started out young and sounded very much like a youngster her age, and that was fine, but when she got older, Ms Holt forgot to make the dialogue and reactions of the daughter grow up with her age. From age 5-6 to age 12 she sounded the same. Once again difficult to believe. There were too many subjects, too many characters who didn't play enough of a part to be a part of the story. The gothic elements of suspense were nothing like Ms Holt's other books. For me a great disappointment.I kept watching and waiting for the ARC but didn't see that transpire either.No, this was not my cup of tea...or if it was, it was lukewarm, at most.",0
I could not finish this book. I normally enjoy his books but this one was full of unnecessarily lurid descriptions which left me sick to the stomach.,0
"The Queen's Secret is about Katherine of Valois who married Henry V and was the mother of Henry VI. When Henry V dies, Katherine is at first devastated. Her one year old son is now King of England and she fears that he will be taken away and raised by others. Her fears are well-founded and, in despair, she turns to Owen Tudor, her Clerk of the Wardrobe, for comfort. Eventually they fall in love but a queen isn't allowed to love where she will. They marry in secret and the rest of the book is about them trying to keep their relationship a secret.This book is so repetitive and badly written. Katherine will narrate that something has happened. Then she will go and tell Owen that it happened. Then twenty pages later, they will repeat their conversation. Seriously. I was on page 264 and Owen and Katherine had a conversation that rehashed everything that had previously happened in the book. And, if Katherine is worried about something, you get to read about it again and again and again and again. She worries about her son getting taken away. So she talks to her nurse, then Owen, then a random person. There isn't any new information in these conversations either. You just get beaten over the head with her feelings. I thought she would be an interesting character. Instead Plaidy makes her seem like a whiny, helpless, creature who magically forgets the world when pregnant (this isn't an unfounded accusation, she is pregnant five times in the book and mentions at least twice that, while pregnant, the world's events don't seem very important to her). This really may be attributing too much characterization to her because I cared about none of the people in this book. The dialogue is like a bad romance novel. I think the average sentence is about five words long. Is is all so awkward and stilted. This is a fascinating time in history. Henry V actually conquers France, then suddenly dies before he fully consolidates power. He leaves his two brothers in charge while his infant son grows up. Joan of Arc then rises up to save France from the English. And yet, reading this book I was either bored to tears or frustrated enough to throw it against a wall.One final complaint. Ellipses are not substitutes for commas! Jean Plaidy apparently never learned that. In a random sampling of four pages, I counted 14 ellipses. It is...ridiculous...and distracting...and completely inappropriate punctuation.Really I recommend reading anything other than this book. Save your money and your time and get something different. Edith Pargeter wrote a novel called A Bloody Field by Shrewsbury that is about Henry IV and Henry V when he is young. It is an excellent book. Read that instead.",0
"This series started out great, then the second book was ok, the third and fourth were pretty bad. This one is middling good. It started out as if it were on fire, then the end totally bit. Once again, characters who are good and honorable and likeable - end up dead. What is Martin's problem? Is he clinically depressed? People have called him the American Tolkien - hah. No way. He doesn't have half the talent. It seems as if he's making this up as he goes along. Everytime he seems to have written himself into a corner, he pulls some rabbit out of his hat and goes off in another silly direction. I may not even read the rest of the series until it's in the Kindle bargain bin. I'm really tired of the endless ways he finds to just drag things out. It snows, so everyone stops. We sail from here to there. Even Tyrion is starting to be a boring character. Unlike the Lord of the Rings, which this can't even hold a remote candle to, I get no sense of history from this. He throws a bunch of names about, events about, how about a LOTR like timeline in the back of the book, rather than those endlessly dull repeats of the houses. Does anyone really not know who Robert Strong is? I'm surprised he even killed of Tywin Lannister, since he seems to hold such love for the evil characters. Now what he does at the wall, and leave us hanging... well, I'm fed up with this crap. It took him six years to write this? I think he has a dart board in his office and he hits it and says ""Ok, that'll happen."" This started with such promise, and it's going down hill so fast. The sad thing is for at least half the book, it was far better than 3 and 4, the ended just like them. Also, little tidbits like Brienne showing up for two paragraphs, are not fulfilling. Now we have to wait? Where's Bran's little brother? I'm rapidly not giving a damn. I wish Daneyrs would show up with all three dragons and lay waste to all of Westeros so this whole endlessly, needing some serious editing, series would come to an end. Color me unhappy.",0
"I must note at the start that I was a sea officer myself (a Merchant Marine navigator) for sixteen years, so I can appreciate the fine points of seamanship and leadership styles that may elude some readers. Please keep this in mind as I review the book.I've read all of Forester's Hornblower, and Kent's Bolitho; and about half of Stuart's Hazard novels. O'Brian's ""Lucky Jack"" Aubrey suffers badly by comparison. I do not approve of him as an officer; about the only thing he gets right is that you must inspire and not drive the men. But he depends far too much on luck and does far too little planning in his campaigns, and I cannot say that I approve of his personal conduct ashore. When Aubrey is at sea, he does an adequate job of running his ship, but on dry land he lends new meaning to the phrase ""spending money like a sailor on shore leave."" In my opinion he should not be allowed ashore without a keeper, and never should be allowed more than pocket money. He needs a man of business to handle his prize money, for heaven known he can't. But that is by the way.When I read Forester, Kent, Reeman, Stuart, Gallery, or Griffin I expect action, and I am generally not disappointed. But O'Brian spends FAR too much time on the soap opera aspects of Aubrey and Maturin's lives ashore. I frankly could not care less about their romances, because they fail to advance the plot, as, say, Hornblower's romance with Barbara Wellesley does; or in similar vein, as General Frank Savage's romance with Flight Lieutenant Pamela Mallory does in Twelve O'Clock High. I find that O'Brian gets so bogged down in the non-naval aspects of the novel, that actions such as Aubrey's cutting-out raid in the Polychrest or the strike against the Spanish flotilla in the Lively late in the novel are almost incidental.If you like your seafaring adventures with a strong admixture of irrelevant soap opera, you will adore Post Captain, and O'Brian's other works in the Aubrey-Maturin series. However, if you are looking for action and adventure by men of decision and daring, you'll much prefer any of the authors I mention in the third paragraph.",0
"I truly believe that Patterson believes three-fourths of the world (if not  more) is illiterate.  This book irritated the hell out of me.  For goodness  sakes, I am a sentient, intelligent person who can structure a sentence and  appreciate a good phrase.What is this regurgitated madness? Yada,  yada, yada.Stop pandering for the sake of a buck.  One word to the  reader: NEXT!!!Smooches!",0
"I'd read the rest of the series and wanted to find out what happens next and anyone contemplating this book is likely in the same situation and willing to buy the book regardless of my review, especially now that it is being discounted heavily. But man does this book DRAG. It has been a 2-year gap since I read the book that comes before this one (remember that the last book parallels this book so we are going two books back to the prequel). The book dances between multiple character threads and locations, referencing plot developments that have faded in my memory. And it just goes on and on and on with angst-ridden wanderings and plots with little in the way of action. I'm writing this at about the 1/3 point in the book so maybe things will pick up. If you've read the rest of the series you're going to have to read this one but it isn't literature.[Edit] I am editing this review after having just finished the book. The edit includes a downgrade from two stars to one and this additional material. This book is just horrible and I feel like I am being held hostage to whatever Martin wants to do because I'd invested my time in the previous volumes and the story lines. I wanted to find out what happens to characters with whom I've built relationships but still no joy and no resolutions. This book has no fewer than eight different plot lines going and each chapter jumps from one to another meaning that continuity within the book suffers. Further, many of the plot lines are left over from previous volumes and given the time gap between this one and the latest it was difficult for me to remember what was going on the last time we visited some of the characters. Further, the plot is dispersed so widely in both geography and characters that I am frankly having trouble keeping many of the minor players straight.Martin has woven a world that I am sure he understands but if you are looking for something to read with an ending don't look to this series. Instead, this is more like a multi-year TV show where you have to just tune in week after week to see what happens. But instead of following a close cast of characters through ongoing adventures Martin has created his full employment program by just broadening his world. I'd have much rather he had created spin offs so I could at least have some resolution on part of the story.I'll probably buy the next one, if it ever comes out. But I certainly won't pay full price for it. I'll wait again until it is deeply discounted for Kindle.For what it is worth, this is the worst review I've ever left and am not someone who goes around looking for problems or complaining just to complain. But I resent having my investment in this story and characters hijacked into a vehicle to sell me this unsatisfying content.",0
Am a big SiFi fan. I just couldn't get into this one. The pacing is slow and uneven. The beginning is confusing and I couldn't get beyond it.,0
"Only good point of this book , his writing skills are still sharp as ever.Now bad points, I dont pay money to read about nothing happening. Plot doesnt go anywhere.There is no character development or movement in the timeline.Coming to violence , he must really have a dark and dreary mind if he cannot write a single chapter of hope, of unsullied dreams. I am tired of reading about his endless sufferings that the good guys have to suffer. By trying to make his bad guys so bad he is making them look like fools. & he is forgotten about the main threat from behind the Wall. There is no appearance of them in the entire novel.I was compelled to write such a scathing review of him because he is a well-establised behaving like he can get away anything.One star is because of the beautiful writing.",0
"I didn't like it, honestly.  People consider the Alex Cross trilogy thrillers, (If you call them thrillers at all...I just call them straight out slow paced and boring) fast paced.  They're not fast paced! There's hardly any good action scenes and gun battles, no Shoot 'em up lethal weapon stuff, which was what I expected yet didn't get it.  The only reason that people consider this book fast paced is because of the short chapters.  Yeah, I admit it, there are some very short chapters.  Lots.  But that doesn't mean that it's fast paced.  It's fast paced compared to Stephen King, but I think it's a slow paced book.  I want action.  I want adventure.  The killer kills a lot of people.  I didn't need disgusting and awful as well as dull details that James Patterson gives out.  And also, Patterson had a good chance to make this a good cop thriller.  He failed miserably.  I don't think I've ever read a good detective novel...all I want is a book with a bunch of action scenes.  If you think this is fast paced, good for you.  But if you desire more action, more events, more UNPREDICTABLENESS, then go to a different book.  I don't know which one, since I've never read one like that...anyways, don't get this book.",0
"So I started reading this book on Kindle because it was free. At first I liked it. I was even considering buying the 2 other books in the trylogy (Green Mars and Blue Mars). I enjoyed the way the author narrated the story - moving from character to character. I enjoyed the description of the travel from Earth to Mars. I enjoyed the political discussions the first few days/years on Mars.I was even fine with some of the inconsistencies - for example, if you were going to populate Mars, why would you spend time and resources to do the same with one of its moons at the same time? It didn't make sense to me - and the book did not give any justification for this. They simply sent some of the scientists to the Mars moon and the rest to the planet itself. No big deal. But in my mind an inconsistency nevertheless.And then the book went on to describe Mars geography. At first it was fine, but after a while it became really boring. I typically like to read details, but when they matter to the story or they make sense. To describe Mars landscape in such level of detail did not add anything to the story. I started to gloss over those long descriptions.So as I was reading the book I played with the idea of stop reading it. Why waste my time. But I wanted to like it and I continued. Until I got to 70% of the book. I decided to stop and go read something else.I finally decided to stop reading after realizing how weak the author was in character development. There are two important characters that are quite different - one is an adventurer, who likes to move from place to place and engage in small projects. The other one is an administrator - who seems to like to be in the office and deal with administrative and bureaucratic stuff. Part 5 of the book is dedicated to the first one (the adventurer). Part 6 is focused on the second one (the administrator/bureaucrat). So in Part 5, the adventurer is doing what he likes to do - travel from settlement to settlement visiting with people. Midway through part 6, we find the bureaucrat (immediately after obtaining a major success in a political conference) leaving his office life behind and joining a group of nomads travelling from place to place. The same way the first character did (the adventurer). So in short, the author seems to like to describe Mars geography more than anything. And as a result any character he is focusing on will be travelling from place to place all the time... Even if it doesn't make sense to the story...So, I decided to stop reading (my first book I didn't finish). And I will not buy the other books in the series.",0
"Many reviewers are condemning Miss.Gregory for the harsh portrayal she made on Anne Boleyn (Introducing her as a power hungry/evil woman who manipulates other people's feelings and is striving for Global recognition) In short Miss.Gregory has used all those false/inaccurate accusations that were against Anne Boleyn as solid facts in this novel to further our dislike for her person. As if it weren't enough that the character is already portrayed as an ungrateful/spawn of Satan/absolute b*tch to everyone around her including and perhaps especially her own innocent sister but it is also strongly suggested that Anne Sleeps with her own Brother George and for what you say ? For creating a male heir, when Henry couldn't give her one when Tudor England was a time commoners and nobles heck even doctors alike all believed women were responsible for their child's sex !I'm not sure if the author was willing to neglect this fact like what she did so frequently while writing this book but the science of genetics didn't exist in Tudor England. We know this things now after years and years of research but people back then [weren't] aware of the X & Y chromosomes. So for Anne Boleyn to commit incest with her brother George [because he can give her a *male* heir to the throne] is not only improbable but highly inaccurate.Unfortunately, the plot doesn't help us as [readers] sympathize or empathize with Mary Boleyn [Who is portrayed as the sweet/naive/innocent girl that falls into the claws of her overly ambitious family] which is something Miss.Gregory very clearly wants us to do. Historical inaccuracies aside there isn't much likable about Mary's Characterization in this novel she is represented as a sweet/innocent child of 13 [I know it was common for women to marry early back then] but yet she already commits adultery with the King and avoids her husband in the process but it's O.K because her family forced her into this. She betrays her Queen Katherine of Argon by stealing the letters she sends to her Spanish relations for her family to use it in their spawn but yet again that's perfectly suitable because she loves Katherine. Her Husband eventually dies and Mary gets over his death in lighting speed [which is perfectly fine but doesn't render any affection towards the character] then she falls in love with another man, marries him and leaves her maddening sister to her own devices which would render her downfall. A sister that she doesn't even care about and hates.The Plot yet again doesn't make sense. If we were to believe that the Boleyns really pushed their daughters into the arms of King Henry VIII and eventually into his bed [Yet again another inaccurate assumption/doubtful] and that both Mary's children were Henry's [yet again another improbability] then one keeps wondering why would the Boleyns replace the Younger [more] fertile sister with the Older and shrewish sister ?Anne Boleyn wasn't a Power maniac who seduced the King ruthlessly and tricked him into marrying her. Thus ruining her family's good graces and digging her own grave. It is was [death] to disobey the King. If Henry VIII wanted Anne in his bed it would've been really foolish for her to tell him [NO] or to run away. She knew the destiny of her sister Mary and how she was no more than a mistress, she probably didn't want to repeat that fate and did what she could with what she had. Got the best out of the situation. Whatever Anne was it is clear enough that Henry wanted her badly to not only leave his Queen of so many years for a woman of no noble blood but to break with the Church of Rome in a time were the protestant faith was looked upon as heresy.If Anne was [What] this novel claims then it's a wonder she didn't have her head cut off the first five minutes she entered the court. I'm Not a fan of Anne Boleyn having more interest in her daughter Elizabeth but she was more than just sex and lies. I know it's Historical [Fiction] and the authors take some liberties but show the woman was some slack. And the reformation ? Show us that this is what had caused England years and years of Religious turmoil.Can this Novel be enjoyable ? Yes, but only if one treated it as the way it should be a [fictional] account plucked out of the author's imagination Not as what Miss.Gregory want us to treat as which is Historical facts or High Probabilities.PS, It is mentioned somewhere in the novel that Anne & Mary's mother has also been rumored to sleep with the King. In this light the author portrays the Boleyns as nothing short of concubine providers for the King's amusement which is ridicules and unnecessary. Plus, almost disturbing to think that Henry was possibly but improbably a father to either Mary or Anne ! [Disgusting]PSS, The author claims to be a feminism writer and wants to show that in her novels. I think derogatory is the more accurate term. Portraying women who are sex slaves as angels while ambitious once as evil to society.",0
"I bought this book because it was rated so highly and it was a NaNoWriMo novel. Somehow I made it to the bit that describes the old man having a shower which is about a 1/3 the way through according to my Kindle progress bar. I don't know how. I found it so incredibly vulgar that I just couldn't keep going. I didn't even care enough about the characters or the story to skip to the last few pages to find out what happened. In fact, I wish I could erase what I did read from my head and gain back the time I wasted reading it.",0
"Along with many other fans of this series I am disappointed with the direction this series has taken. This is easily the worst written book of the series, and as far as storyline goes, along with A Feast of Crows, should have been edited down to peharps the first two hundred pages of a real novel, one that would have have moved the series forward.I really have to wonder what the writers at HBO are going to have to do to make these books palatable for a television audience. There are so many new characters, so many new viewpoints, that the story has gotten completely bogged down. And Martin doesn't just tell us what they are saying, we have to know everything that they are thinking as well. Add to that he's been giving us glimpses into the disatnt past of the land by sliding in snippets of ancient legends and myths that we have no reference points to, or any real reason to care about anyway.At first I was glad to see that he has included the maps to the Free Cities and the lands to the East, but this was short-lived. Much of the story takes place in these lands, asnd so we have to have endless descriptions of the customs and food and governments of these places that just serves to take up space. A lot of space.. What it also does is take is away from the main plot in the first three novels, which is Who will eventually sit on the Iron Throne of Westeros. We cared about what happened to Arya and Jon and Bran, but now they are such a small part of the overall plot that they no longer seem importanat, or relevant to the resolution of the main storyline.The plot, what there is of one, isn't very interesting, and much if not all of the action takes place off stage, like the battle for Winterfell. There are no surprises, no stunning developments or character deaths that made the first three novels so much fun to read.One last observation. Martin seems to take perverse delight in humiliating his characters, both great and small. Tyrion, Sasnsa, Arya, Asha, Theon, Cersei, the list goes on and on. It all began actually when Eddard agreed to allow Sasna's dorewolf Lady be killed, thus dooming her to the role of a pretty pawn. This trait has gotten much, much more pronounced in this novel. So much so that several of the chapters are nearly impossible to get through without physically cringing. What this leaves us with are a group of characters so flawed, so affected, that we don't have anyone left to root for. And those characters that we did care about, are so far out of the mainstream that what they do can't possibly seem to matter anyway.By the time Martin gets to finishing Book Six of this never-ending story, HBO will have to hire all new actors for the televison series. Or maybe they will rewrite these last two books, and edit them, the way this one should have been edited in the first place. Better yet, they should probably just skip it all together.",0
"There is a reason that 40% of reviews of ADWD are 1 or 2 stars.  As good as A Game of Thrones is wonderful this book is so uninteresting that I couldn't wait to stop reading it: picking it up now and then, like any addict, hoping for a fix that never comes or satisfies.  The trajectory of this series is much like that of free falling object. If the first couple of books hadn't sucked me in I'd have stopped reading this one in the middle, much like I was quick to jettison Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time which at least kept my interest for 5 books. This much I know: If Martin ( who is as far from being an American Tolkien as the nearest blackhole is from earth) doest wrap this abomination up in book six I won't even bother to finish.  I can't imagine that Martin in his heart of hearts truly believes this work comes within light years of approaching A Game of Thrones.  Maybe we are expecting too much and Martin is just another one hit wonder.  You can't help but wonder if he is dragging this out for the money.",0
"I was very eager to read this novel. The picture on the cover intrigued me; that's as far as the fascination went. The book was not very interesting. It read like a documentary with a few poorly written graphic scenes to keep its readers reading. I finished it, but wouldn't read it and again and won't recommend it.",0
"This would have been a great young adult fiction book. However, the author, for some reason, was really into nasty words and graphic sex. Too bad she took the low road and destroyed her book. I don't understand all the people who thought it was brilliant - it was just ""dirty."" However, it had potential.",0
"I was very disappointed by this book.  I am a great fan of Christie's writing (I named my cat Jane Marple) and I could not be more ready to enjoy something that she wrote.  In this case, however, I repeatedly put the book down and walked away from it, only finishing it because I wanted to see how it ended.  Christie wrote it late in her career and the best explanation that I can come up with was that she was coasting on her success and not putting as much effort into this as in her earlier books.  Passenger to Frankfurt is a spy novel rather than a murder mystery. It bears a strong resemblance to The Big Four, a very successful earlier novel.  Both plots center on a sinister organization bent on world domination, a threadbare idea at best.  It works in Four because of the obvious care that Christie put into creating the intricate plot which, while complicated, can be easily followed; and into the characters, the hero being Hercule Poirot who was already a well developed personality.  No such effort was spent on this book.  Passenger opens in an airport where Sir Stafford Nye, a minor diplomat is petitioned for help by a young woman who says that she will be killed if he doesn't lend her his cape and passport.  He does, and the action moves from there.  The book is not doomed from the start.  As I said, Christie can make this sort of thing work and she leaves herself some excellent openings.  The main trouble with the book is that it tries to cover too much and tell too little.  Christie seems so unwilling to give anything away that large segments of the action are left out and throughout most of the book the reader has no idea who the good guys and the bad guys really are, even down to the heroes.  By the middle of the book the plot has gotten fairly absurd.  This secret society has instigated a youth movement worldwide, spearheaded by a handsome young man who they claim to be the son of Hitler.  That in itself might not be so bad, if she hadn't pushed it on to have these youth take over all of South America, force Chicago under martial law, et cetera.  There are also long paragraphs in which the author goes on and on, philosophizing about the young.  Since the book is copyrighted 1970, it occurred to me that this might at least in part be inspired by the popularity of public protest among young people at that time.I know better than to give away the ending but I will say that I found it very contrived and I didn't feel that she had given the reader enough information to make it really fair.The saving grace of this book is the characters. While some are woefully underdeveloped, others make excellent proof of Christie's talent in this area.  The best by far is Sir Nye's Great-Aunt Matilda.  Sharp old maids have always been this author's specialty and the parts in which she appears seem more like genuine Christie than anything else in the book.",0
"This series DOES NOT qualify George Martin as ""the American Tolkien"" - a quick review might more accurately say ""a book of bad menus, weak plots, plenty of fill to disturb the flow of what little story there is, and overweening characters that are impossible to identify with unless you live your life on a teenage page of Facebook"". If you're a reader who thinks Robert Jordan lost his way with the Wheel of Time series, (or may be his editors were milking the money) don't read this book.",0
"The author chose to use the British colloquial accents, phonetically, which was as difficult to read as if it were in German. This book was obviously written for the British reader, but the American reader would spend a goodly portion of his time trying to pronounce words and phrases and than understand the entire sentence. The Burma campaign is all but foreign to the American public, more so than the history of the Eastern Front during WWII. We obviously have not given credit to our allies, especially when we have a General MacArthur in the vicinity. There are better books on the Burma campaign written for the American reader.",0
"this book taught me not to start series of books until the last one is published.when (i mean if) the series is complete, i will pick it up again (or wait for hbo to finish it?).i think, not sure, this book is longer than all of the lord of the rings books combined, yet NOTHING happens (well enough happens that a 1 page summary can easily suffice, i've seen it done in reviews here).sad to see the greatness of books 1-3 diminish...",0
"The gimmick of this book and its translation is that it doesn't use the letter 'e' anywhere in the story. To make up for that, the writer uses 3 or 4 words to describe what a single word containing the letter 'e' would have described succinctly and more adequately. So the book is a jumbled mass of text that is difficult to read and even more difficult to care about the story or the characters. I got through 30 pages before I stopped reading. It was hard to go from reading Atonement by Ian McEwan to this frivolous mess of a book. Worst part was it took 2 weeks to arrive from an overseas book seller, and the wait was not worth it. I almost gave this book as a Christmas present... got lucky I decided against it even before trying to read it.",0
"I wouldn't recommend these books to anyone!  They are laborious to read, complex and frustrating !  The characters are interesting but the writer never fully completes their stories. I am left frustrated with a feeling of incompletion. I wish I had never started them.",0
"The book was weird. I felt like I was reading a porn book or something. The description on how the female dances, it goes all into details even how she touches her boobs she even goes naked. I don't get it is she a a circus whore? I didn't want to read a book on how she touches herself... so im returning,Im not into that kinda of reads. Maybe it is not like that as in whole book? but its an early start for dirty things so I assume the rest of the book is the same.",0
"Due to the hype, I bought--stupid stupid stupid!--all three of the books in this trilogy. I did finish the book, although I am not sure how I did it. Here's the storyline: Describe the landscape for 20 pages, describe in INTRICATE DETAIL what all the little widgets and gadgets that the colonists brought with them are, talk about the beautiful scenery some more, have sex, some more technical stuff, make a failing attempt to develop the characters, have sex again, etc. The back of the book talks about how the last hundred pages go at the speed of light. Sorry, but I didn't find the ending memorable at all. Then there's this hard-to-visualize part where they have an LONG elevator or something attached to one of Mars' moons. I felt like I was reading Pecos Bill and how he would lasso a tornado with his rope, only this time he's doing to a moon. Highly over-rated. See that bright red dot outside your window? I suggest you take your copy of Red Mars and throw it out the window in an attempt to knock the red planet out of the sky. No aliens, either. This book makes A Princess of Mars look good.",0
I did not like this book at all...I thought it cruel..even in fiction ...i do not like reading about people who torment simply because they can...i couldn't finish this novel...,0
While GRRM's talent is still apparent in the writing style the plot is gone.  You'll feel like you're treading water within his world when you've become accustomed to swift pace in books 1-3.  The biggest tragedy is that the meandering handling of the characters.  You won't look forward to seeing a name pop up at the top of a chapter like before.  In fact you'll likely dread some.  By midway through I began to hope this book was just a vessel to finally kill off Daenerys.  That hope wasn't enough to justify reading the second half...The book feels like those albums that musicians put out to get out of their label contracts.,0
"Life behind the scenes at the circus was crude and inhumane;I will always view it differently!  The 90 year old man telling the story reacted the same way I would have...stomach distress.

"This book was for the most part far too sad. It was also so cruel firstlyto the people who were treated worse than, being starved, being murdered, having no human rights. The animal cruelty was unbearable and inhumane. I am so glad I didn't see the movie. I wish I had never read the book it was nightmarish. Although we know that these things happened its just awful to read it and feel such pain AND sorrow. I woulsnt recommend to to anybody, ever",0
"I have read all Tom Clancy's  books with the exception of his ops book.  It took me four years to find the energy to finish reading this book that  had a rather convoluted plot at the outset.  In uncharacteristic style,  this book seemed to ramble and peter out in spots.  The battle rhetoric was  over the top and unnecessarily long winded.  I only finished it in order to  read the newest Jack Ryan epic, The Bear and The Dragon, because regardless  of the rambling, I still really like Ryan, Clark and Chavez.",0

"This was one of my VERY rare forays into ""chic-lit""!I came by this book in the ""flotsam-&-jetsam"" library on a small remote Pacific Island, and because I usually enjoy anything with an Ancient Egyptian theme, I souvenired it and brought it home to read.It starts OK, ...with the literary technique of running two parallel stories, ...one in the present and one in the past.They are linked by an artifact which belongs to the two protagonists, ....which may or may not be genuine, ...(but of course you immediately know that it is!)There is actually a third minor story, set largely in ancient Egypt that is retold at the beginning of some chapters. It aims to explain the presence of two spirits who are forever tied to that artifact.Anyway, off up the Nile we go, ....in a sort of an Ark-type plot, with various characters eager to get their hands on set artifact for unspecified reasons.(Yes, Agatha Christie's ""Death on the Nile"" does come to mind...)Still, it's a good set-up and it could have been more than an interesting premise, but then the author just gets onto some sort of rotary turntable and repeats and repeats the same things for chapter after chapter.It's intersperced with readings from a old diary belonging to the person from the historical story, which may hold the clue to the whole business in the present-day counterpart. Just why the modern day girl (Anna) doesn't sit herself down and read the whole damn thing all at once is beyond understanding. It would explain everything, and being on a long languid cruise up the Nile she would undoubtedly have had more than enough time to finish the thing.But no, ...we just get instalments which are read long after they would have been of value to the mystery.The settings are well described, ...(the author actually took a trip up the Nile), but the male characters are very poorly drawn, either very one-dimensional, or with such extreme qualities as to appear more schitzophrenic loonies than real people.Toby was certifiable,(until his make-over at the end) ...while Andy such a over-bearing presumptious man-boy-prat that I would have gleefully drowned him in the Nile long before we got to the First Cataract!Anna is attracted to him of course!The novel makes great use of the occult and ancient Egyptian curses, ...and a later one involving a recurrent phantom cobra no less!(Still capable of a lethal bite though, phantom or not!)  These elements are allowed free reign in the story. Ancient ghosts appear, possessions take place and it must be said that co-incidence and highly unlikely occurences are resorted to in driving the narrative.I was very tempted to bail out about half-way through this repetitive tale of the ""helpless"" little lady (Oh woe is me,.. who can I trust...etc. etc.?)There are just not enough new developments or even suspense to keep you interested.However, I plowed on and finally got to what I hoped was ""the ending"". (It's quite a lengthy novel.)Ending? Did I say ""ending""?There just isn't one. After the author resorts to a black-out, amnesia and/or some sort of a mental breakdown to get her heroine quickly back to London, the ""Mills-&-Boon"" technique is allowed to set in and everything ""ends"" happily (and quickly!)as the girl gets the man,...but not before a few more of those highly unnecessary and VERY unbelievable co-incidences are shoved in for good measure.There is just no resolution of any of the former fuss on the Nile, ...and of course that damned ubiquitous artifact ""re-surfaces"" (literally!!!) in what can only be described as a highly unlikely manner.This, together with the dubious story of the ancestry of the suddenly Mr. Nice-Guy Toby is really pushing the bounds of credibility!Anyway, ....this is definitely NOT for those who like their women characters ""strong"", ...FAR too much of those neurotic fainting ladies bordering on the brink of a nervous breakdowns for me.In fact at the risk of appearing sexist, I'd have to say this book is not for blokes at all.And really only for women whose hearts tend to go all a-flutter at the ""tall mysterious romantic stranger met on a vacation to an exotic land"" type of thing.",0
"Last week, halfway through my own reading of WATER FOR ELEPHANTS, I decided to check the customer reviews to see if any other readers were rolling their eyes as much as I was, and, to my surprise, not many were.  300 hundred reviews and most of them were five stars!  What seemed paper-thin and kind of ridiculous to me was ""beautiful and moving"" to nearly everyone else.  Everything about this book seemed like a cheat--like the warning you get on a bag of chips--""contents may settle""--to explain how there are only three chips in a family-sized bag.  Even the inclusion of the period photographs seemed to excuse the writer for not making clear enough pictures of her own.  It's not just the implausibility of the story either (elephant speaks only Polish).  If the details are right, I can be drawn into even the most ridiculous of stories (THE RUINS and THE TERROR come to mind)), but the paragraphs here are so flimsy (usually no more than three sentences long) that I never pictured (or believed) a word of it.  I'd close the book and pick it up a few hours later and have absolutely no idea what had happened.  It was an ""easy read,"" but I don't know many writers who would consider that a compliment.",0
"I have been a fan of George R.R. Martin since 1996.  The first three books were amazing and probably the best three fantasy books I have ever read.  Those books were fantasy stories for adults told by an adult who could write beautiful prose.No one builds a world like Martin.  No one.  His descriptive abilities are second to none and his characters are usually just as rich and vibrant.The fourth book, ""A Feast for Crows"" was the inevitable clunker that seems to plague nearly every series.As I read ""A Dance with Dragons"", I caught glimpses of the first three books in the series but in the end, it turned out to be more like the mid-series clunker.  Only it was worse.If you like descriptive prose that is sometimes beautiful, this book is worth four stars.  Martin goes way overboard on the descriptions, but that is a fantasy author's right to a great degree.On the story side, the book is worth one star.  It never came close to actually recapturing the brilliance of the first three books in the series, it just gave hints at that lost brilliance.  I would have given the book 2.5 stars if it were possible on Amazon, but since it is not and since I value story over technical writing ability, I went with the lower ""whole star"".The plot flies apart in Dance.  New characters are introduced out of nowhere and old friends are relegated to the woodpile...maybe to be revived later (who knows nowdays lol).  There is no resolution to be found, only more questions and more frustrations.A good book, even in a series, usually has a beginning, a middle, and an end.  Dance felt like almost pure middle with tiny portions of beginning and end mixed in.  Those portions were too small for a book of this length at this point in a series.As far as the series goes, I am among Martin's oldest fans since I have purchased every book within a month of release.  I don't like the pace at which he writes and, to be fair, I don't understand some of his public relations efforts.  However, I have always loved his writing.  I was willing to forgive the clunker that was ""A Feast for Crows"" but my hopes were dashed in ""A Dance with Dragons"".I want the old Martin with that rare mix of beautiful prose and adept story telling.",0
"Nothing happens and those things that do happen just piss you off... the book go no where and once you hit the last 5 chapters you want to throw it out the window becuase of what happens to a certain character...I loved all the other books, this one just dragged its feet and dissapoints severally.Not sure if I even want to purchase the last 2 in the series when they appear in 2035~ only took what 5 years for this one..../rant",0
"PG to me seems to want to rewrite history to make Mary Boleyn more important than she actually was.I wonder what PG has against Anne Boleyn. She seems to sympathize way too much with Katharine and Mary. The idea of Anne as a wicked stepmother persecuting 'poor innocent Mary' is false as Mary's treatment worsened after Anne was beheaded. Also, while Mary was no monster, she is responsible for the deaths of her own people. She is not innocent by any means. The young Mary deserves pity, the adult Mary does not.Anyway, PG takes every rumor about Anne and presents them as fact and even invents a new one, such as Anne adopting Mary's son. There is no basis in fact for this. Having read her later works, it seems to me PG despises Anne and her daughter Elizabeth. I understand this is fiction, but many people who are not as educated in history as myself may take this as fact. I am very concerned, especially since Anne is long dead and cannot stand up for herself.As for the book-- I am not squeamish in regards to sex. But PG has written a porno, not a novel.  For example, ""Put your fingers in your cunny...."" I had to skip over half the book due to scenes like this. PG, please leave this to your readers' imagination. We do not need to know what Henry and Anne Boleyn did in the bedroom!There is one thing I will say  for this book and that is that it got historical fiction going again. That is why I give this book a very generous 2 stars.",0
"I say that because this book is just Feast of Crows the Second. It's very clear that this author has no interest in writing this series any longer; the plot fumbles for about 100 pages and then I gave up altogether. I do not know if this was ghost written, but it certainly shows that the author will just keep reusing plots for money. Shame on me for buying it without having first read the sample.",0
"I'm going to be upfront with readers of this review, I am not a very smart girl. So many of you giving negative reviews really know your Tudors' History. Everything I know about the Tudors stems from *cringe* the television show (love it), Wikipedia, and various other websites around the internet.But even I, with my very limited knowledge of Tudors History, was seriously annoyed with the mistakes in the book - especially when you consider how self serving they were to the picture perfect main character. I have never seen ANY historian claim (even on Wiki dang it!) that Mary was the younger of the sisters. If I remember right she was actually likely the eldest of the living Boelyn children. This makes sense considering that Mary was the first presented at court and the first married. As another reviewer said her being the youngest adds nothing to the storyline so why not just get it right? I think PG was trying to make Mary as innocent as possible and being just a young teenager made her more likeable to the reader perhaps. However pretty much everything I've read about Mary agrees on the fact that she had some miles on her (classy terminology FTW) when she arrived to the English court. I think the fact that she married someone who was generally deemed below Boelyn level is proof that this is true. It's pointed out how great the Boelyn/ Howard family a million times in this book and someone as pretty as Mary was said to be would have probably fetched a husband from an even better family...unless she had a bad reputation.In PG's mind sisters are apparently polar opposites. Since Mary is blonde, sweet, and shy, Anne is dark, vile, and loud. I have to say this author really does not seem to like Miss Anne Boelyn very much. This Anne is nasty to everyone, clever but somehow incredibly stupid at the same time, thinks negatively of everyone around her, and even tries to seduce her gay brother several times (what the heck?) in the book. Also, pretty much every thing that Anne was accused of, things that most historians agree are probably false and made up so she could be executed without much argument, are true in this novel. If a person only read this book and never anyhting else about Anne Boelyn they would not have a very good image of her, when in reality Anne was said to have done lots of nice things in her short reign as Queen of England.As I said before, I am not very smart. I do not usually pick up on misogynistic language and themes - even obvious ones (Snow White anybody?)- but in this book you're practically slapped across the face with it. Mary is quiet, shy, conventionally beautiful, listens to her male handlers (for the most part) and gives into the King's sexual desires as soon as he asks. She is rewarded with beautiful children, a loving husband, and a nice quiet life in the country (because being a farmer's wife in the 16th century was easy as churning butter I guess). Anne, on the other hand, is mean, agressive, sexual (while withholding herself from the king so as not to be another used and disgraced woman), and most of all DARES to think of herself as equal to or (le gasp!) better than the men in her life. No, these behaviors would have NOT been acceptable in Tudor England from a woman, but this book was written in the 21st century by a female author, no less. A little perspective please?So yes, go ahead and tell me that maybe I'm just too dumb to understand this novel, but I think i'll stick with other adaptions that don't take such a negative veiw of poor Anne.",0
"Were this book written by anyone but GRRM, it would be laughed out of the publisher's office. It has no real plot development. There is no build up of story. No climax. Characters and story arcs are still being introduced in the final chapters... It's just a ""whole lot of nothing"" interrupted by main characters dying every now and then for no discernible reason other than GRRM doesn't know what to do with them anymore.",0
"I began to feel about halfway through the third book that this series had gotten away from GRRM - he'd killed off most of the interesting and sympathetic characters and didn't know what to do with the ones who were left. The fourth book was bad and this one is just terrible. A boring, painful slog through a meandering plot, endless details, and tangential stories about random characters, most of whom are either new to the book or so un-memorable they might as well be. I'm imagining our author laughing hysterically about having written as bad a book as he could and still selling it. That's the only explanation I can come up with.",0
"This &#34;classic&#34; is more about relationships than  the development of Mars.  Way too much soap opera for me. I just could not get into it. About half way through, I found myself increasingly skipping pages to finish the book.",0
"Over all an interesting but fatally flawed book.The writing is, in parts, truly appaling. Some of the sweeping statements made throughout the book, that certain individuals or their wives were obviously stalinist agents working for the undermining of america or western society, are unsupported or utter conjecture.  Indeed parts of the book read like a rant against leftist intellectuals and writers, leveling accusations and condemnations at them solely on the basis that they were leftist, therefore obviously they were the tools of stalin.  Trying to link the cambridge spies to Munzenberg on the flimsiest of evidence seems like stretching reality to create the legend of munzenberg rather than recounting the history of the man.Reading some of the other reviews it seems that this book appeals to those people that seemly already share a deep distrust and loathing of ""dangerous left-wing academics"" that seem to be trying to undermine american values.  This book will no doubt provide barbecue talking points for white collar red-necks so they can heap scorn upon and ignore any academic or spokesperson that questions the status-quo.  They will be able to discount any person that does not agree with their own ""elightened"" position on the grounds that they/their university/institute/etc was established or funded by the soviets to produce nothing but anti-american propaganda and can therefore be ignored.So, an interesting book, putting forward very interesting ideas, but sadly poorly written, in parts poorly researched and comes across as a damnatio of C20th intellectuals.  Overall this book would appeal to the america, god and guns brigade.",0
"After two hundred and fifty pages of waiting for the protagonist to do something, do anything even remotely worthy of our spending time with him, I finally gave up. It's shocking that this is what has become of American literature. It's the Oprah factor. ""Oh, isn't it so romantic that this guy makes out with the bad guy's wife while the bad guy beats the elephant with a stick with a nail in it."" This guy allows the elephant to be beaten on a daily basis and he's a vet and he does nothing. I don't know, maybe in the shocking ending we find out that this wimp didn't really exist or something like that, but I couldn't read another page where this ineffectual non-hero continued to do absolutely nothing. Zero. Just imagine ""Grapes of Wrath"" except Tom Joad turns a blind eye to workers being beaten so he can sneak around with a married woman and call her by her first name in 90% of the sentences in which he speaks to her.If you love animals of any kind, you will hate this protagonist. This book is worse than ""Cold Mountain.""",0
"Started Whispers in the Sand and really got into it. Wanted to keep trying to get back to it and read what happens next. It did bring me along and let me figure out some things on my own, rather than out right telling me what the author wanted me, ""to get"". I like that in a novel. But OMG, to keep going over and over the same thing as the book progressed. Then to end it the way it ended. Just a thread in the air. The Author also felt a explanation was warranted. I thought that was weird too. It was as though there was a beginning, middle and then, infinity. I just felt it could have been handled a lot differently. I am afraid to put in the time to read any of her other books, for fear that I will be left with the same taste in my mouth at the end.",0
"After finishing the slow trainwreck that was A Feast For Crows which immediately followed three of the best fantasy books I have ever read, I was hopeful to see the series get back to its roots. I understood that due to the damn dragons a time skip or period of danys being off screen would be needed. What I didn't know was that George would handle it in the worst way possible. Except in Theon's case he seems to be ignorant to when letting a character linger in shadows is appropriate and when it is not.Brienne for example, brought us nothing but a cliffhanger in book 4, when she could have gone without a POV, or two chapters max.In Dance the number of pointless chapters is disgusting.Surely the master who wrote Game of Thrones could nestle Tyrion into the story again in an interesting way? But all of his chapters amount to nothing and I confess I skimmed the later half of them. He went from the best character in the series and some of fiction to being annoying and negligible.Aegon came out of nowhere, and while Griff is interesting his arrival was unwelcome amongst so many stale POV's.Arya has fallen from grace like Tyrion and for two books has been a bore. All we needed was a chapter of her entering training, and then when we see her when training is done a brief recap, instead she pollutes countless pages in both books.Dany is so painstaking, only around 4 chapters were passable. The rest were atrocious bores.Jon had a strong intro in the book, but it deteriorates when time is spent on irrelevant aspects of the NW, and his POV ends with what was foretold at the beginning of the arc biting him in the ass, with an obvious cliffhanger.I confess I wanted to see frankengregor defend Cersei in this book, but instead we get her long drawn out suffering. But I wont say that is bad.Victarion is a beast but accomplishes nothing and didn't need to be included as such.Asha is annoying at this point and I had hoped she died when we first saw her in this book.Bran has been in a similar boat to Arya, though his journey has been long and dragged out. Luckily this book gets him to his goal in some of the more interesting chapters. But where his character will go is unclear and has been for 5000 pages. I don't think GRRM knows himself.Quentyn is the funniest character, due to the fact he was such a silly addition to the story. I didn't know why he had come in and just wished he would die. His ""Oh"" thought as he got roasted was actually awesome and made his few chapters ultimately hilarious, despite being wastes of paper.I can't say it was all bad.The prologue was amazing, and if the others actually did something in the book it would have been an incredible set up and tone setter. Much better than AFFC's garbage intro, to which I am also convinced George created without a reason. But I digress.Davos is still pretty cool and meets some neat people.Theon out of nowhere is the best POV in the story, though even he could have done with one less chapter.Melisandre as a POV made me grin, though its unfortunate it goes nowhere.Barristan is awesome too, but Mereen feels so much like a filler area I am hard pressed to care.The epilogue is great, except that it makes me yearn for another installment, a real one. Which may never come.George still writes great, but it is so clunky and bogged up that it makes the crappy POV's unbearable and the good ones tedious. Another reviewer made a great point, that in AGOT that Cats journey to Kings landing was not several chapters. It happened hastily because there was an end goal to be reached, and the journey was not a significant element. However in ADWD EVERYONE is stuck in the stasis of a journey.Imagine if AGOT spend 3 chapters for the trips of Cat to and from Kings Landing, that when the Khalasar ventured to their conquests the journey was documented. That on the way south from Winterfell the trip before and after the Joffery incident were written in detail. You get the idea.These meaningless journeys prefaced by cliffhanger endings aren't needed in the first books because there IS a destination. Martin knew where we were going and was excited to get there. That is the core problem with the plot and pacing of the series.As far as the main flaw in the writing formula, the whole description, description, description, CLIFFHANGER routine is seriously getting old with the previously mentioned problem. There are cliffhangers just for the sake of being cliffhangers, so much to the point that nothing happens in the meat of the chapters. I kid you not, only about five chapters have anything truly interesting happen before the last paragraph. This is doubly offensive when it is a false flag character death. Tyrion obviously wasn't going to drown, Davos obviously wasn't going to be killed, Brienne obviously wasn't going to be killed, most annoying Jon snow obviously isn't dying like that. For a heartbeat I though Quentyn was going to come back and I would have needed to burn the book.The final problem and the most infuriating is that every book(although the first 3 could justify it and had some big event or resolution) builds up, and leaves a plethora of cliffhangers. In 1 and 2 especially it was done well enough that you could imagine just enough and smile at what you thought might happen, but in 4 and 5 it all just feels random.IF the next book actually cuts the filler and brings home a legitimate story that cuts the cheap tactics and redeems the seemingly lost causes like Arya and Bran, and gets Dany and Tyrion back on the right track we will have the makings of an epic with a sluggish middle. Otherwise this will be one of the worst series ever, and a legendary bait and switch.",0
"Elephants Can Remember was one of Agatha Christie's last mysteries; in terms of rating I would rank it as slightly below ""satisfactory.""  While it is far from her best, it is not quite among her very worst, either.The weaknesses of Elephants Can Remember are several.  First, there is a marked lack of action of any kind.  Elephants Can Remember is concerned with an investigation into deaths that happened entirely in the past.  Therefore, the whole book consists of conversations.  There is never any danger or threat to anyone living, so there is no element of ""excitement"" as in most of Christie's other books.The second weakness that I would point out is that the solution of the mystery, as it were, becomes fairly apparent to the reader about mid-way through; the rest of the time is spent waiting for Hercule Poirot's amazing gray cells to figure it out and catch up to what the reader/listener already knows.  The third weakness is that the solution to the mystery involved actions that I found entirely unbelievable.  I won't expand any further than that so as to not spoil the story for anyone who hasn't yet read it, but Christie had a couple of characters behave in ways that were quite reprehensible, but that is never called into question.  Her explanation for it, as it were, doesn't hold water.The only really excellent thing about this book is the narration.",0
"When I began reading Tom Clancy's books I was enthralled with the author's exciting plots- my summers were usually devoted to reading and re-reading his books as I'd imagine myself in the thick of the action. Since Clancy  wrote 1991's &quot;The Sum Of All Fears&quot;, his books have become  longer, duller and less interesting. I found &quot;Executive Orders&quot;  to be his worst work to date.  The slow meandering plot is pretty hard  to follow- not because it's so complicated. It's not. The problem is that  the plot takes so much time getting going that you lose interest as Clancy  positions the pieces one-by-one. The actual plot is pretty derivative of  all of Clancy's other books, so the ending isn't much of a surprise. The  most basic problem with Clancy's work is in his characters. Clancy  obviously envisions Ryan to be a blue-collar everyman, just one that  slipped into the White House through extraordinary circumstances. Much is  made by the author of his hero's status as an &quot;independent&quot;. It's  too bad that Ryan comes across, consistently, as a doctrinaire,  by-the-numbers, straight out of the pages of The National Review,  conservative. Clancy, who has always been injecting his right-of-center  politics into his books (though more obviously and stridently of late),  puts his politics out in front here. &quot;Executive Orders&quot; is more  politics than policy. Clancy is on his soapbox and the plot too often gets  shuffled to the back for President Ryan to give some loopy tirade about  liberal &quot;special interests&quot; (and there aren't conservative  ones?). First clue that non-conservatives won't be given equal time: the  book is dedicated to Ronald Reagan, who &quot;won the Cold War&quot;  according to Clancy. Give me a break. Too bad Clancy couldn't have made his  case without his hero's preachy speeches. After hearing Ryan's 1,314th  speech informing another character he &quot;is not a politician!&quot; the  reader will want to yell back: &quot;Then shut up already!&quot; The  character of Jack Ryan has always been a difficult one to judge- heroic by  far in Clancy's other novels, Ryan makes the transition from preachy,  sanctimonious hero to preachy, sanctimonious jerk in this novel. A Tom  Clancy novel hits you hard and fast and the action takes your breath away,  but when the plot slows down and we try to get character moments they  sometimes seem painfully forced. Clancy characters are written like post-it  notes: this is the Good Guy who is a conservative/soldier/CIA analyst, etc.  This is the Bad Guy/Girl who is a liberal/Russian spy/terrorist/feminist,  etc. Can you really tell me how much different the characters of Jack Ryan  and John Clark are from one another, aside from their names and character  histories? Not a whole heck of a lot. I'm sure Clancy thinks he's giving  America the kind of leader (read: conservative) they want in this book, but  Ryan comes across as a breezy, &quot;I'm-doing-the-right-thing and people  will see that&quot; conservative whose politics and style bear a striking  resemblance to Newt Gingrich. The old Goldwater-for-President slogan  &quot;In your heart you know he's right&quot;, is a favorite dream of  conservatives and Clancy relies on it here. Why does the subplot with the  &quot;mountain men&quot; militia group fizzle out so spectacularly?  Probably because Clancy can't bring himself to make people whose political  viewpoint he sympathizes with the bad guys.  In the end the reader  will sigh with relief when he or she finishes this monstrosity. I did. My  advice to you, don't even pick this one up.",0
"I was sure I would love this book after reading the other reviews and the fact that I love historical English fiction, but this book is truly awful.  The premise is wonderful and the book starts off great, but it soon becomes repetitive and disjointed.  Also, I volunteer for a domestic abuse support center, and the scenes of a young woman allowing herself to be physically abused over and over were very disturbing.  I wish the book had lived up to my expectations.",0
"I've never read Tom Clancy before.  I've seen the movies, and enjoyed them  (THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER in particular).  But Clancy as a novelist was a  new experience.I suppose I should have seen my overall reaction coming.  When Clancy dedicated his book to Ronald Reagan, I had a sneaking suspicion  as to where the story would lead.The story has plenty of pulp promise.  What appears to be the entire American government is wiped out in one fell  swoop, and it's up to Jack Ryan to become the new president.  But Clancy  doesn't know when to quit.  He adds on layers and layers of subplots, most  of which would work by themselves, but only serve here to bloat an already  large novel.Part of the problem is that there is no sympathy created for  any character.  Every person in Ryan's entourage is decent, hard-working,  and completely uninteresting.  Any person who doesn't fit in with Clancy's  idea of a hero is treated with suspicion and contempt.  It might make a  difference if ANY character was remotely memorable, but evidently,  characterization is not Clancy's strong suit.I had higher hopes for the  action portions of the novel, but alas, I was also disappointed.  Pages and  pages of technical jargon only prove that Clancy has done his homework.  What it doesn't do is advance the plot.  Tank warfare may make for  entertaining viewing, but they make for deadly dull reading.  Particularly  if, once again, there is absolutely no empathy created for anyone involved  in the actual battles.And as for the actual backstage look at how the  presidency is run?  I am reminded of a recent newspaper critique of  television's THE WEST WING.  It stated (quite accurately, to my mind) that  when it comes to drama, the democratic viewpoint is the most dramatically  satisfying.  It leads to shows such as THE WEST WING, I'LL FLY AWAY, PICKET  FENCES, and HOMICIDE.  When the republican viewpoint is emphasized in a  drama, you get THE A-TEAM and TOUCHED BY AN ANGEL.",0
"I know that JP is one of the best selling authors in the US over the last quarter century. I just can't see why. This is supposed to be one of his best books, so I thought I'd give it a shot.This book, like the rest I would imagine, is formulaic, the characters are one-dimensional and overly clich&eacute;d, and the overall plot was plodding and quite predictable.JP, I gave you an honest try, but I won't be reading anymore of the Alex Cross books.But good luck to you and god bless.",0
"Now, I do not mind some artistic freedom, I.E. condensing the time frame, adding new characters and events as long as the truth remains intact. Not so here and as a modern woman it SICKENS me to see a nobody like Mary Boleyn who, during her time, was known as a slut and stupid, easy tramp, being elevated to be innocent heroine while a a fascinating, brilliant woman like Anne Boleyn is turned into a tasteless, swearing, slutty bitch. Where is Anne's wit, her elegance, her charm and her lively humor? Hasn't poor Anne been maligned enough? And this author even believes that she committed incest and adultery, something that NO historian worth his money would agree with? Warnicke, the historian Gregory based some of her theories on, frigging distanced herself from this drivel, what does that tell you?Another thing that BUGGED me senseless: The portrayal of Henry as a pedophile, screwing 13 year old Mary Boleyn. YUCK.Badly researched, distorted, perverted and sickening drivel posing a literature. And of course this pile of rotten garbage will be a huge movie next year, trash always secures profit while the truth may not be ""interesting"" enough. It took centuries to clear at least most of Anne's reputation from all the filth thrown at her by ignorant fools. Now all that work will be rendered useless by this awful book and the upcoming film. BRAVO, Miss Gregory, I hope you're happy! Absolutely revolting and disgusting!",0
"I won't go into detail since many others have done a far better job than I can. I'm only about 1/3 through this book so far. I was very disappointed in Feast for Crows and this book will join that one in the disappointment category. Storm of Swords was sooooo good! I didn't expect the 4th and 5th books in the series to be as good, especially since I had read the reviews, but my gosh. I'd say it's a fast read because you can skip a lot except in places it's so boring that I tend to fall asleep (I only have time to read at night). I wanted to read Dance with Dragons right away since I have been reading the entire series this year after getting hooked on the HBO show. All I can say is, I hope Winds of Winter is better and doesn't take Mr. Martin 5 years to publish because in 5 years, not only will I have forgotten everything I've read, but I may not care. I guess if you're a fan of the Song of Fire and Ice as I am, this is a must read, as I considered it, but be prepared to slog through it and be prepared for the characters to act differently than they did in Storm of Swords. 'Nuff said.",0
"All of these books of Martin's could have been written in a third of the amount of words by editing the many useless  and repetitive descriptions. This author loves to ""hear himself talk"" w out EVER telling a story.",0
"This book has been hyped up by many of my friends. I was excited when the price was lower because I wanted to read it. It took me weeks to finish because I wasn't interested. There was too much ""jump"" from one time period to another. I understand the Author's purpose, but I was truly disappointed.",0
Great start to the final book.  Reminds readers and viewers of what has happened and provides updates in preparation for that extremely intriguing conclusion. I so look forward to that resolution of this series.,0
"...so I started reading this book. About a third of the way through my doctor prescribed clonazepam and I no longer needed the book. Honestly, I can't see how anyone could get through this book without already suffering from insomnia as badly as I was. It is the most boring book I have ever read and I could only force myself because it was the middle of the night, there was nothing to do, and I had mistakenly bought it.I am a fan of hard science fiction, and that is what this book purports to be. But hard-SF needs to be speculative and push boundaries. This doesn't. An analogy might explain - in the 19th century cantilever bridge building might have been seen as cutting edge technology. Imagine someone writing cantilever bridge fiction. The science aspect of it would be completely uninteresting. It would be a story about the politics and economics of getting the bridge built. Well this book is about that interesting. It's a collection of uninteresting unealistic characters involved in endless contrived office politics trying to get some uninteresting science and engineering done. It just so happens that it's on Mars but most of it is far less interesting than bridge building. I'm not exaggerating. We have to read about how concrete foundations were laid, how bricks were manufactured and have to suffer detailed geological surveys of the areas the characters visit.If your preferred genre is boring books try ""Report on Probability A"" by Aldiss. I used to think it was the most boring book on earth but at least it was short and turned boredom into an art form worth rereading. Read Mars is boredom without purpose. Your time would be better spent actualy reading some real science about Mars.Addendum, Jan 1994Well I did eventually finish this book even tyhough I thought I'd given up. Some things do happen later in the book. The characters remain supremely uninteresting and there are still no original ideas. But there is some entertaining large scale destruction if you like that sort of thing. So I bumped the rating up to 2 stars.",0
"Disgusted by the trend started by Jordan all those years ago to create the unending series. And now Martin continues the process. How can you really have a voice or a point of view if you just keep babbling on and on?? Finish it even if you give it a lame ending, stop thinking about dollars and more about your craft.  And 4 to 5 years between books, how is that not about money?",0
Very disappointing - if you are an animal lover - don't bother purchasing this book.  I don't think I even got half way because of disturbing animal accounts.,0
"There is no resolution to this series!!!! I read all 5 and this author does not ever wrap it up!!!He goes on and on and never gives the reader ANY satisfaction. I am furious! This guy has violated every rule of novel writing,but he is successful in getting us Fools to buy 5 of his books.Maybe he has a 6th book but at this point I dont trust him and I'm DONE!!!",0
"*AUDIOBOOK* QUALITY REVIEW - READ BY ROY DOTRICE:  Few months ago thought I would, instead of re-read the series, listen to it.  So I duly got all 5 books on audio and loaded them on my iPod.  They were great companions for long walks and hikes and fishing ventures and what have you.  Good quality, no complaints, transported me to Westeros as well as can be expected.At least the first 4 books, where I had the good fortune to get the versions read by Roy Avers and John Lee, did.  Then I got to audiobook 5, A Dance With Dragons, read by Roy Dotrice, and... I don't know what genius decided to change readers, but it was a ginormous brain f*rt.  All the characters sound like they're the age of Aemon Targeyan, if he had a thick Scottish accent.  All.16 year old Daenarys?  Sounds like a 90 year old Scott with throat cancer imitating what he misremembers women to have sounded like.Pre-teen Bran?  Sounds like a 90 year old Scott whining.Cercei?  Sounds like a 90 year old Scott male in one sentence, then a 90 year old Scott drag queen the next, and back and forth between the two in that vein.And conversations between characters?  Forget about it!  Audio doesn't have quotation marks, and G.RR Martin doesn't do a lot of ""then Bran said '...'"" or ""'...' said Jon"".  In prior books the readers got around that by changing tone and pitch when switching from character to character.  This book? No change in tone or pitch or anything to let you know that the speaker changed.  It's just one jumble of an old gravelly voiced Scott, and most of the time the listener has to guess from context who is talking.I hope there's another audio version coming out, read by either Roy Avers or John Lee - or anybody else for that matter.  If you're buying the audiobook, do yourself a favor and avoid the version read by Roy Dotrice.",0
"Clancy's works are exemplars of this school of suspense novel, which is largely driven by endless boring descriptions of infernal devices, catalogs of weaponry and technical specifications of their capabilities rather than character, dialog or even a credible plot. This particular book wastes nearly a thousand words describing how to make a pistol silencer -- which I suppose would be useful if I needed one or had the marine machine shop the hero uses to manufacture it. The plot is ridiculous and the hero is a dipstick who manages to get a woman killed because he is so stupid he drives with her into the ghetto to look for a dope dealer. It's idiotic, but that's what Hollywood wants these days. . .",0
"I was late coming to this series and have read all five books one after another. Books 1,2 and 3 were brilliant and held so much promise. Book 4 seemed to wander around as if the author was struggling to find a coherent story to tell. Book 5 is no more than a continuance of that lack of cohesion, although the level of brutality is incomprehensively raised to a new and excessive level, and the reach-backs to explain things stated as fact in Book 4 were annoying and unnecessary. All in all, the series has lost all of its steam. It seems Martin has no idea where to take all of this next or how to end it. If there is a Book 6, I'll probably read it, though I expect no more than more disjointed and pointless minor episodes that have little or no connective tissue between them. Put simply, Martin can, and probably should, just put a fork in it, it's done.As to the HBO series, there is a Season 2 on the way, and maybe a Season 3, but I doubt it will go much beyond that. There is no cohesive story that could be dramatized in Books 4 and 5. Maybe if Martin moves quickly and manages to complete a Book 6 that actually brings an end to the ramblings, some producer might see some value in combining Books 4,5 and 6 into one final season, but I doubt it.",0
"I purchased this book because it won a Nebula award.With all due  respect to Mr. Robinson, this book is dull.  It is a mindnumbingly dull  read because of the endless exposition.  It just goes on and on and on and  it takes forever for anything to happen.You'll either love this book or  hate it.  I didn't like it and I opted not to read the sequels.",0
"I agree with those reviewers that believe that this is not Agathat's best work, far from it. Her foray is mystery and this books attempts to be a thriller, which doesn't work at all. I cannot say that the writing is bad but this entire book is just not interesting. Her other books that have to do with world organizations are much better although also couldn't be compared to her regular setting of a family murder. So much of the plot just doesn't make sense and apart from the three main characters everyone else remain hazy, which is never the case in any of her other books. I have the entire collection and must say that this is her most unsuccessful literary attempt.",0
"I read a lot of English historical fiction.  I was really surprised to see all the good reviews for this book.  I thought much of it was boring, hard to read, very contrived and unrealistic.  Also there is a disturbing amount of abuse of the heroine, including multiple rapes - and the heroine keeps going back for more.  SPIOLERS ALERT:  At least four characters (Sam/William and Nick/John)are violently abusive to the main character.The only interesting thing about it for me was the look at the life of Moll Wallbe.  I could barely get through this book and was glad when it was over.",0
"His books get longer and longer but have less depth, and story. You'll get entire pages dedicated to family members they will never mention again. It's like reading early chapters of the Bible... and Mzdahr, begat Lothar, who begat Hizdahr, whose second uncle was a great man of the fishing provincies and had three brothers named.... WHO CARES!!!!  I find myself skipping entire pages. He does the same thing with descriptions of places, explaining every wall in a room, Ok I get it,flesh out your story. Don't write a movie, including screenplay, and set design all in one. Needs to seriously learn how to edit out the crap or the for the next book I will only be reading the Cliff's Notes version.",0
I have no idea what the hoopla is about but I find this book to be just alright at best. It is a little slow. The characters didnt have any passion or oomph. It was just very blah to me. I do like Reese Witherspoon and Rob so maybe the movie will be more entertaining.,0
"Kim Stanley Robinson has done his homework. He knows all about atompsheric partial pressures and soil ecology. He knows how to convey information via the written word competently. He knows not the first thing about people or fiction writing, though, and that's unfortunate. The Mars &quot;trilogy&quot; is a single boring, shapeless mass of words. The characters are laughably two-dimensional symbols, avatars for ideas or concepts -- they're not people. If they were, you wouldn't want to know them.And they talk. They talk and talk and talk. They argue and argue. They talk about terraforming, they talk about politics, they talk about each other, in an endless cycle of debates, meetings, conventions, committees, assemblies, conclaves and arguments. Robinson has invented a kind of Model UN, he has worked to draw charts of manufactured political factions boring each other to death in interminable meetings. It is not interesting. It was not worthwhile to expend this effort towards such a boring end.What is most depressing is not the boring storyline, the endless loops of the same argument, the stupid and contemptible behaviour of many of the characters, but Robinson's contempt for the English language. English, to him, is just a tool; a means of expressing information. If he could write fiction in equations he would. He ends sentences with &quot;etc., etc.&quot; and tells us about his characters' lavatorial habits. He shows not a shred of joy, of affinity for his medium. There is no structure; &quot;Red Mars&quot;, &quot;Green Mars&quot; and &quot;Blue Mars&quot; are all the same book. That this deathless, humorless prose is used to trace out a saga of such incomprehensible tedium is unforgiveable. Only the bland competence of the whole endeavor rescues it from complete failure; and even then Robinson has missed things: the SI unit of pressure is the Pascal, not the Bar, and that Kelvins don't come in degrees.",0
"At the end of listening to ""A Feast for Crows"" one is greeted by the author seemingly responding to the slew of readers that finished the book and were dissapointed.  He acknowledged that he left half of the main characters out in the book and would rectified this in the 5th novel ""A Dance With Dragons"".  Although we do get updates on some of our favorites characters (Tyrion and Daenerys) the majority of the novel watches these characters make little to no progress in their story arcs.  Although this tendency for the nobility to sit by and basically do nothing hoping that their problems will go away may be realistic, this is not something that a reader wants to read about for several hundred pages.  He promised to progress the story forward but I feel he is crushed under the weight of the dozens of subplots he has made up.  For the upcoming 6th novel he really needs to concentrate on the main characters (Tyrion and Jaime Lannister, Daenerys Tergaryen, Petyr Baelish, Stannis Baratheon, Bran Stark and John Snow) and move this novel towards some resolution.  After two novels in a row with little progress I hope that he will prove himself worthy of the comparisons to Tolkien and write as strongly as he did in the first novel.",0
"I know James Patterson has sold millions of books,but I didn't care for his style.I'm in no way a genius,but it's almost like he dumbs down his books for the masses.I've tried two books,same opinion on both.",0
I like happy endings and this one did not have one. It was boring until the 17th chpt. I felt like I was reading an Alfred Hitchcock book.  I figured out most of who the killer was and what was going to happen but the last few pages blew my mind.,0
"I start this off by saying that if anyone goes into this book thinking anything significant is going to happen in the greater scheme of the plot, then YOU KNOW NOTHING [insert name].I think anyone who has any experience with the last couple books Martin has given us pretty much gets it by now that we have morphed into a kind of soap opera where there is lots of drama but the overall story goes nowhere. Much like in General Hospital, most of the characters are transitory. They come in, they go out, they come back again, but usually never leave for good unless you are a Stark. Of the Starks, they are almost forgotten, as it has been so long, we have heard so little from them, and they have so little influence on the plot.The series has been trending towards an unending ""now"" and this book has been worst of all in that respect. The sheer number of characters is staggering. I almost have an adverse physical reaction every time he introduces another one. Even in a huge book like this, one hears little from many of them and nothing from more (get it? many and more?). This book also manages to capture the ""long-thought-dead character appears"" vibe that you get in daytime soaps.Unfortunately, also like a soap opera, there is very little action (again, worst in the series in that regard). No kidding, pulse raising moments are very few and really far between.  You had better be in this for the experience as this plot moves s-l-o-w.I was so glad to be rid of Jon Snow (assuming we are really rid of him) as his story line was absolutely glacial (no reference to the Wall intended). No kidding, a great deal of the book was dedicated to his character but aside from meaningless dialogues with a horde of other characters I could care less about, NOTHING happened.If you are ok with all this, it is not a horrible book. Many of the characters are actually engaging and the world that Martin created is still compelling. The prose is ok, but not as good as it used to be.  Lots of repeating stock phrases that were once clever, overuse of new vocabulary words (Martin must have learned ""Leal"" while studying for the SAT or something) and lots of bad language used in an unimaginative manner (e.g. ""the queen commands you to #$%@ her"" seriously?, we waited how long for this?).On the good side, Martin never fails to amaze me with his ability to express human suffering and barbaric behavior.For people who have not started plowing through this series, don't start. Stick to the HBO TV series. For those already bought in, go ahead and read the book (use the Library if you can as I doubt you will pick it up again). Just know that the farther this thing goes on the more complicated it will get and the slower it will move.Great example of an average author who had a flash of brilliance long ago and has successfully milked while drifting back into mediocraty.",0
"Neil Gaiman, responding to readers complaining about the Martin situation back in 2009, stated that Martin ""is not working"" for his readers. Let the little people keep buying and suffer in silence.Gaiman is an idiot.I am lucky in that I started reading the series just eight weeks ago, which is how long it took me to finish book five. If I had started reading back in 1996, and had to wait the seven years between the superb book 3 and the lackluster books 4-5, I would be livid beyond words. No spoilers here, only the sad fact that, as too many have noted, Martin takes 2000 pages to get little done. Yes, the competent prose is still there, but prose was never Martin's strong point. His strong point was character, plot, drive. There is some minor development in books 4 and 5, but that's about it. To take seven years and 2000 pages to accomplish just that is unforgivable for an author. Forget the readers; the characters deserve better. The series deserves better.Even a mildly competent editor could have pared these two books down to a single volume. Doing so could have saved the series. Sadly, this did not happen. If it did not happen for books 4 and 5, it probably will not happen for books 6 and 7. That means we are looking at a wrecked series. I don't know if Martin is capable of bringing what is now a mess back on track; I'll wait to hear some reader responses before buying the next book.",0
"I picked this book up a day after reading Catch-22, perhaps the most drawn out, most asinine ridiculous over rated book ever written, and For Whom the Bell Tolls is the second.I found this novel silly, a glorified, and tamed sex novel one might find at the grocery store.  The love making scenes were ridiculous, what was this ""thou, oh, oh thou oh oh oh"" garbage?  It took me a week to get through this book, which from reading other bad reviews is pretty quick work of this novel.This novel wasn't all bad, which is more than I can say for Catch Number 2 (that was not an error).  The three action packed scenes (The murder of the ""fascists"" at Pablo's town, Sordo's battle, and the blowing of the bridge) were actually pretty entertaining.  These were the fastest chapters of the book though they were the longest.  I did a little research on Hemingway and found that he had a minimalist style and liked verbs more than adjectives, and didn't like flowery language, I feel the man could have used an adjective or two to liven up this dull dead book.Oh and watch out for that long drawn out paragraph that goes something like this ""Now, all now, and now I say now all we have is now and then now this is now and now i what we have"" that's pretty close to what he wrote and it continues with the ""nows"" Then there was the DIRECT translation of Spanish.  What was that all about?  ""Less bad""?  That's ""menos mal"", which means literally less bad, but in English it sounds STUPID.  It's different when you read this book and are fluent in Spanish you see why the English is not less bad but all bad.  And what of the Thees and thous?  And Nays?  I get it, they were speaking archaic Spanish, one sentence at the beginning telling us that would have been sufficient, now I have to feel like I'm reading a 15th century novel.  The whole Robert Jordan thing was also annoying, just call him Bob or Robert or Jordan.  Lastly, what's with te glorification of communists?  The book is supposed to be about the death of idealism, but I saw none of that.",0
"I chose the book because I loved others books written by Howatch, but this one unfortunately disapointed me a lot.-",0
"It is entirely possible that Martin either did NOT write the first 3 books or did not write the last 2 books...the notion that the same person wrote all 5 is impossible.  We could henpeck all the inconsistencies in style and tone and talent, but there's really no point. If you're a fan, you know something's wrong.I've read other stuff by Martin and it's pretty decent. Fever Dream being on of my favorite vampire books, I'd say the guy has some talent in writing. That said, NONE of his other books come close the the complexity and moxie of SOIAF.  I have theories as to why the first three books are not in the same league as the last two.  If you'd like to discuss the conspiracies, please comment here and a message will be sent to my hotmail account. My user-name here is name I use for my email as well.Is George RR Martin part of one of the largest literary consipiracies since George Eliot?? Let's explore the possibilities together.",0
"The scientist Thomas Betterton, a brilliant young American who developed the ZE Fission technology that can be very important for modern warfare, has disappeared suddenly out of England. Has he been kidnapped or did he depart out of free will to work for the enemy? If Betterton's wife asks for permission to leave the country for a relaxing trip to Morocco, she gets followed by security agent Jessop. It all turns bad when her plane crashes on its way to Cassablanca. Nevertheless she succeeds in continuing her trip, but is not fully aware into which beehive she stumbles.First of all it must be stated clearly that this is not a detective story, but an atempt at an espionage novel. When Agatha published Destination Unknown in 1954, Ian Flemming had just created his famous James Bond character in the novel Casino Royale. Although Agatha clearly has the intention of making the plot flamboyant and bursting with action, she never succeeds in coming close to the fantastic plots that Flemming created. It is clear that the specialty of the Queen of Crime lies in the typical whodunit with Poirot and Marple as the key-characters and not in novels of espionage. The plot of Destination Unknown is straightforward and, although some admirable attempts were made to surprise the reader, lacks the level of suspense that normally characterizes this type of thriller.This book certainly does not belong to Agatha Christie's highlights. But then again, it is still remarkable that seen the enormous size of her oeuvre, she only wrote but a few really bad books.",0
"When most fiction writers approach issues of rape and abuse, they quite sensibly tend to imply acts of violation rather than indulge the fantasies of the darker side of the male psyche with extensive and prurient descriptions of acts explicit violence. In 'The Real Story,' I feel that Donaldson has over-stepped his mark and might as well have included detailed, close-up colour photographs depicting rape, if immersion in appalling and repeated acts of sex crimes was the effect he wished to achieve. I guess most testosterone driven men (including myself) have a darker side to their psyches, but we recognize the barbarism our impulses and divert and suppress them: for shame, we refuse to indulge the beast within.Donaldson expresses some agreement with this viewpoint but, in his Afterword, he says, ""It was as if in imagining him, [The chief rapist - KR] I'd tapped directly into the dark side of my own nature.""  He also states that ""If I drew on some buried part of myself to create Angus, so much the better: at least I'm writing what I know.""  Mr. Donaldson, you far over-estimate the value of visualising and verbalising the savage instincts of the beast at the heart of man. You merely give voice to proto-man, stripped of all restriction, civility and culture: to the inchoate lust of the beast.The result of your lapse, Mr. Donaldson, is a ghastly expression of voyeurism focused entirely on the continuous degradation and humiliation of a human being in a manner all to commonin today's world. I do not find this acceptable entertainment, but rather, quite simply as rape-pornography.Before the hackles of some of my readers rise to risible conspicuousness, I would add that I am not advocating censorship: actually, I quite enjoy good quality erotica in all its forms. But this book should carry an age restriction and a pornography label (in my opinion).Nevertheless, Donaldson is an immensely talented writer and I quite enjoyed the story overall. He really has tried hard (maybe too hard) to reflect the elastic, multi-level dichotomies that exist in every human psyche, through the vehicle of his three main characters.I feel that he could have turned this into a masterpiece had he reflected a little longer on the dominance of his tale by a focused fascination with rape as a means of breaking the human spirit - and re-written it.",0
"To make my point I'll be as concise as possible in this review. 90% of this and Feast for Crows were not only boring, but pointless to plot. The other part of the problem in Feast, repeated here, is focus on characters that aren't interesting. And most importantly, Martin's insistence on the use of internal narrative over and over again - whether it be simple thoughts or dream sequences - is completely unnecessary. When it was Catelyn remembering playing with her sister and Littlefinger as kids I could take it, because those folks were interesting. But I don't need 200 pages to realize that Cersei hates everyone, and I don't need 200 pages of Dany contemplating, or Tyrion pissing.  I don't need to be reminded anymore that Davos has lost his fingers. If this book was going to be terrible couldn't it have been shorter?!  Maybe in more need of an editor than anything I've read this side of a Bill Simmons article.",0
"Unfortunately, I found this novel to epitomize trite stereotypes of the fading Wild West.  The author is an Englishman who wrote the book from England.  His observations and character developments are over the top and clearly based on the stereotypes of Western Americans that were widely circulated in Europe.It was really tough to get past the first chapter.",0
"Probably the worst book of this series I read them all and the story line was pretty consistent but this book rambles on and spends chapter after chapter on developing characters that do not intertwine with the first 4 books at all...Have to say I had to convince myself to continue,hoping that the story line would improve!I would not suggest this as a book to read at all.Sorry George but this just is not a good quality book to  read at all,sorry I spent the money to purchase this one.",0
"Way too long, and only 100 pages worth of good stuff happens. It was a waste of time to read this...",0

"Well, my review title is just a little bit of a non-spoiler which may make sense if you decide to read this book.What can I tell you that hasn't been said? Not much.There are moments when you can feel the old GRRM at work in this novel, but not many. It is indeed in need of a grand editing. And my sense is that both of the last two books penned by Martin would have made one 1200 masterpiece...had anyone bothered to edit them down.It is true that most nothing happens in Dance of Dragons. A little does. But not much that you will care about. Still, I didn't want it to end because as Martin would have it...it starts to get interesting at the END!!! lolI'm not quite sure what happened here. Really, I'm not. I felt bad when I read all the abuse that Martin receives from fans for not writing fast enough. Well now you can abuse him for not writing well enough.The criticisms espoused by the multitude of fans on Amazon are sadly correct. It is not the worst book ever written, but its just not very good. It's missing all of the ""blood and fire"" of the first 3, with glimmers in the 4th. What it's really missing are...HEROES...or at least our character behaving as such. And gone is the intrigue, mystery and action that we come to expect from GRRM. Sure, there is a little here or there if midgets riding pigs is your thing.This should have been the winner to take back the crown for Martin but despite the moronically positive critical reviews - the fans know that this book cannot touch the first 3.Luckily, since nothing bloody well happens except for people shuffling about, there is still room for Martin to save this series with the next 2 (I guess 3) books.I predict that he will do this but will not manage to capture the spirit of the first 3.If any of you are James Clavell fans, you might remember his atrocious novel - Whirlwind. Well, this is Martin's Whirlwind and sad to say, it will be at least 3-5 years before you get another one and most likely a lot longer.Is it better than nothing...answer - NO. Next time, I'll take nothing.",0
"I evidently misread the writeup, I thought it was a hardback.  It was a cheap paperback.  I got it as a present so I couldn't send it back but I'm very dissapointed for the cost!",0
"There's not a whole lot that can be added to Macaroni's excellent review here:http://www.amazon.com/review/RQMHSVDEC80QEIn sum (without the spoilers): a whole lot of wordiness happens, but not a lot of actual *happening* happens.  There are also several instances where a character has one or two POV chapters, ending in a cliffhanger - and then never reappears for the rest of the book.  And like all books in the series, it ends at a more or less random point, without anything being resolved or even any particular cliffhangers for the overall plot.  Tremendously unsatisfying.",0
"This is more European Portuguese, so keep that in mind. Super small and good for travel, but I didn't get much use out of it. Just being honest.",0
Some of the characters in this book were killed off in an earlier book.It was confusing at best and more characters added when we wanted toknow what happened to the others?Is there another book coming??????  It did  not finish very well.I was totally disappointed.Jon was attacked and we don't know if he is dead or alive - where is Sansaand Littlefinger and Lady Katelyn?This book was very long and very little of it tied together.I loved the other four -  this one was hard to read.,0
"""Words are wind"" is a phrase from all of the series books so far, and one Mr. Martin should take to heart. I thought Dickens was prolix, but at least he was paid by the word.  This book and the last are bloated to the point of absurdity, and there are now so many characters (or perhaps I should say place holders, since damn few of them have any character)that it is hard to keep everybody straight.I do think it's possible to sell a series of this type without the misogyny, sadism, homophobia, and various names for genitalia that would make a 12 year old snicker at their over use.  Their absence, along with the loss of most of the ""pithy sayings,"" would also shorten these tomes by about a fourth.  There has been almost no discernable forward movement of the story in these last two books, and a lack of focus on the principles who are the only 3 dimensional characters.  A Prince shows up and dies, but we feel nothing because we neither know nor care about him.  I suspect Tyrion will supply Peter Dinkledge with a rich character for several seasons to come, but he, and the other characters I really care about, for the most part, I got invested in in the first book, and I see too damn little of them here.  I want to know more about Ned's surviving family, Jaime, the missing direwolf, Robert's bastard, Brienne, etc., without these bloody ciphers getting in the way.George Lucas should make the big screen version--he doesn't know how to write three dimensional characters either.",0
"I have to say that this book, was very much like a soap-opera. Everything was pretty predictable, and that ruined it. I have no clue why she choose this title, especially since Rosie doesn't play that much of a dominate role, (as was expected). What held this book together was the old Jacob, and just the curiousity, to make sure what you predicted was correct. Overall, I say if your looking for a fast read, enjoy.",0
"This must be the worst Agatha Christie book ever. It's her very last Hercule Poirot novel, and one can see that the writer is very old by now (82). There is no freshness left in her prose; it is stale, predictable, corny, and generally trashy. As other reviewers have said, the material contained here would barely be enough to sustain a short story. To make a full-length novel out of this really is ridiculous. The book fails at what normally is Agatha Christie's greatest strength: the plot and the denouement. With dozens of pages left to go, the reader *knows* the solution! Unheard of in the world of Christie; if for nothing else, then for this the novel cannot be rated higher than 1 star. However, the characters and dialogs are boring and cliche-ridden as well, so the book has no redeeming qualities either. Nothing ever happens on the 200 pages of this book; no crime, no mystery, no real conflict among characters; it's all just endlessly boring talk, talk, and nothing but talk about the past. The only interesting thing, perhaps, is to contemplate the autobiographical hints Christie gives us in describing one of the novel's detectives, Ariadne Oliver -- a mystery writer. But these hints are only interesting because they throw light on our favourite writer, Agatha Christie -- they are not interesting in themselves and therefore do not improve the book's literary quality. It was excruciating to have to wade through the turgid prose of this book; this title cannot be recommended to anyone except extreme Christie enthusiasts.",0
"The news of the death of Beryl Bainbridge last year made me want to read books by a very accomplished writer. In our book club we chose to read Master Georgie.This was a great disappointment. We should have asked for advice on what books to read. The book was nominated for the Booker prize in 1998, but did not win the award.While there is an interesting historical episode as the background, and there were different viewpoints, the reader never feels that this is a book that must be read. At times it seemed disjointed. There were narratives from different characters, but that style did not feel the gaps. Different narratives normally means the reader gets an insight into an event from different perspectives. This did not happen.So need to read other books to appreciate the greatness of Beryl Bainbridge",0
"Man...what a disappointment.  I've always loved PKD very much, so, as always, when I picked up this book and started reading, I had no doubt that it would be yet another mind-altering masterpiece.  What I got was no such thing.It's obvious that Dick wasn't quite sure what he wanted it to do with this book; whether he wanted it to be about simalacra, or about Louis's relationship with Pris.  Either of these would have been worthy of further pursuit, or indeed, the two could have been intertwined, each shedding light on the other.  Dick utterly failed to do this, however, in spite of the back cover copy's feeble attempt to connect them.  Instead, he simply drops the simulacra thread midstream, without ever having done anything meaningful with it.  I very much get the impression that he just sort of got bored with it (which I can understand; it's certainly not his most inspired idea, even if it could have worked), and so he decided to focus the last part of the novel on Louis and Pris--which in turn fails to make any point, perhaps in consequence of the fact that most of it has been concentrating his energies on the simulacra.  Furthermore, the first-person narrative seems pretty weak, to be honest, and half-hearted.  I never *really* believed the narrator, the way I do with most of Dick's protagonists.We Can Build You really shouldn't have been published in its current form; there ARE some good things here, but it desperately needs a rewrite or two to filter out the bad.  I don't think anything Dick writes is entirely without merit, but this is about as close as it comes.  It's a mystery to me why Vintage chose to republish this, specifically, when there are so many better Dick novels long out-of-print.",0
I did not find the story interesting at all. The book was recommended to me by a friend whose recommendations I will not take anymore.,0
Why oh why doesn't George Martin bring the series to a conclusion rather than spinning out more and more meaningless subplots?  A Song of Ice and Fire started out with interesting characters and a compelling storyline--I thought the first 3 books were amazing.  Unfortunately it got stuck and went from fluid to frozen.  Maybe that is why the Stark's motto &#34;Winter is coming&#34; has always been so prominent--the author was warning us that the story would become frozen before it was finished.I hope the next books bring life back into this originally interesting series. If not they will just add more confusion to a series that has become tedious and boring.,0
"""The Prophet"" is Almustafa, called ""the chosen and the beloved,"" who has lived twelve years in the foreign city of Orphalese, and is now waiting for the ship that is to come and take him back to the isle of his birth.  Just as the ship appears, all the men and women of the community, including the elders of the city and the priests and priestesses, come to say farewell.  They ask him to stay, but he refuses.  Then the local seeress named Almitra addresses him as ""Prophet of God"" and asks him to speak to them of love and then marriage.  After this, others ask him to speak of various subjects, some lofty such as children, giving, and joy and sorrow, and others more mundane, such as eating and drinking, work, houses, and buying and selling.  There are in fact a total of 26 short chapters in which ""the Prophet"" holds forth before he takes his leave.  Kahlil Gibran was born Gubran Khalil Gibran to a Maronite Catholic family in the historic town of Bsharri in modern-day Lebanon, then part of the Ottoman Empire. His mother Kamila was the daughter of a priest.  When his father was imprisoned for embezzlement, Kamila decided to follow her brother to the United States, settling in the South End of Boston, MA, then the second largest Lebanese-American community in the United States. Due to a mistake at school, he was registered as Kahlil.As a young man Gibran studied art and began a literary career.  His first book for the Alfred A. Knopf publishing company, was The Madman in 1918, a slim volume of aphorisms and parables written in a Biblical-like cadence somewhere between poetry and prose.  The Prophet is said to be an early example of ""inspirational fiction"" consisting of a series of philosophical essays written in poetic English prose.  The book became especially popular during the 1960s with the American counterculture and New Age movements.  Much of Gibran's writings seems based on Christianity, but his mysticism reveals a convergence of several other influences as well, including Islam, Sufism, Hinduism, and theosophy.  To illustrate the relativistic nature of Gibran's theology, ""the Prophet"" says, ""Say not, `I have found the truth,' but rather, `I have found a truth.'""  Jesus said, ""You shall know THE truth"" (John 8:32), and, ""I am the way, THE truth, and the life"" (John 14:6).  Gibran followed The Prophet with The Garden of The Prophet, which narrates Almustafa's discussions with nine disciples following his return after an intervening absence and was published posthumously in 1933.  Gibran had died in New York City, NY, on April 10, 1931; the cause was determined to be cirrhosis of the liver and tuberculosis.I would never have gone out and purchased this book myself.  However, I have heard of it all my life.  It is supposed to be a classic and a ""spiritual masterpiece,"" so when I found it in my father's library after his death, I decided to keep it and read it.  My reaction is, ""Ugh.""  As far as I am concerned, it is mostly pantheistic nonsense.  Someone might say, ""It's all Greek to me,"" but since I took two years of Greek in college, if it were ""all Greek"" I might be able to make some sense of it.  I'll just say it's all gobblety-gook to me.  The Chicago Post said that The Prophet ""brings to one's ears the majestic rhythm of Ecclesiastes.""  Ecclesiastes I can understand; The Prophet I do not!  This doesn't mean that there's nothing good in it.  The ravings of a lunatic sometimes contain a kernel of truth.  Even a broken clock is right twice a day.  However, there is nothing of value that might be gained from The Prophet which can't be learned a whole lot better by simply reading the Bible.  Besides, ten of the twelve full-page drawings by the author are rather immodest and consist solely of nude figures.  Of course, this is not surprising when you read what ""the Prophet"" says about clothes.  ""Your clothes conceal much of your beauty, yet they hide not the unbeautiful.  And though you seek in garments the freedom of privacy you may find in them a harness and a chain.  Would that you could meet the sun and the wind with more of your skin and less of your raiment.""  Oh, by the way, even as simply ""poetry"" it just doesn't do anything for me.  It is not a book that I would recommend to anyone under any circumstances.",0
"Others have done a much better job of describing the story line than I could ever do.  I was a huge fan of books 1, 2, and 3.  Book 4 seemed to drag, and now we hit book 5, A Dance with Dragons.I found this book to be ponderously slow, even tedious.  There was way too much extraneous BS that had to be slogged through.  I don't see the point in mentioning hundreds of names and battles if those aren't mentioned anywhere else in the book...it just seemed like fluff or filler.  It often seemed that Martin was getting paid by the page rather than to produce an excellent book like the first three.  There was ""little and less"" to like about this book.I kept getting this image of a school boy, assigned a 1,000 word essay, saying all he really needed to say in 250 words, and then ""fluffing it out"" to reach the required 1,000 words.  I finished this book, but only because I had so much invested in the first 3.  As another reviewer noted ""...its time to tie the loose ends and finish this tale"".",0
"The plot doesn't move, it creeps in fits and starts.  I enjoyed Books 1-3 but Books 4 & 5 are long, hard slogs of Martin describing banners, castles, roads, religions, family histories, boats, clothing, et cetera ad infinitum, broken briefly and rarely with action.",0
"I do enjoy the book. My issue is not with the book but with the people who altered it to suit their sensibility. If you don't like the langauge used in the book that is fine, but don't change every curse word to ""unprintable"", ""unmentionable"" because you and want you and your children to live in a bubble. You are ruining something that is perfect as it is. You lack the creative ability to create anything on your own so you believe changing curse words into clever terms makes you an artist. Whoever edited this book need be shot, and be sent back to whatever community college academic standpoint they came from where they believe the world is fair and things should all be politically correct.NEVER CHANGE THINGS TO SUIT YOUR SENSIBILITY!",0
I'm glad I got this book for free.  I'd hate to think I wasted money on it.The writer spends and exorbitant amount of time describing the characters feelings and thoughts to the point that it is boring to the extreme.  I didn't even make it to the end of the first section before deciding that life was too short to keep trying to read this book.  Maybe if the author had Chamberlain and Churchill go after each other with broadswords and dueling pistols in the London Underground it would have at least have had a little action and been more interesting.,0
"""My edition of Demanding the Impossible was published in 1992 by HarperCollins Publishers. On p.561, Marshall writes that:David Friedman sees such agencies as both brokers of mini- social contracts and producers of 'laws' which conform to the market demand for rules to regulate commerce. Each person would be free to subscribe to a protective association of his choice, since 'Protection from coercion is an economic good.' Apart from adumbrating The Machinery of Freedom (1973), Friedman has popularized Hayek's defense of capitalism as the best antidote to the serfdom of collectivism in books with such self-explanatory titles as Capitalism and Freedom (1962) and Free to Choose (1979).The true author of Capitalism and Freedom and Free to Choose is of course Milton Friedman, David Friedman's non-anarchist father. Milton Friedman is not mentioned in the two preceding pages of the chapter; and in any case ""Friedman"" clearly is meant to refer to David Friedman. (Nor is Milton Friedman in the index or bibliography of the book, although at least Milton Friedman's books are omitted from the bibliography rather than attributed to David Friedman's authorship a second time.)This error is so egregious that the reader can only conclude that Peter Marshall presumes to write about books that he has never even seen the cover of, much less read. Whether Marshall corrected it in a subsequent edition, or whether the error was simply corrected by the transcriber of the widely available Internet exerpt , I do not know. But even if the correction was Marshall's, for this kind of error to have made it into a published book speaks volumes.On the same page, Marshall writes that:The writings of Ayn Rand, a refugee from the Soviet Union, best represent the intellectual background to the new right-wing libertarianism in the United States. In her The Virtue of Selfishness: A New Concept of Egoism (1964), she attempted a philosophical defence of egoism while in her novels she portrayed a superior individual fighting the forces of collectivism, particularly in the form of the State. Her superior individual, driven by a Nietzschean will to power, appears in the guise of a capitalist entrepreneur who is presented as the source of all wealth and the creator of all progress. Rand claimed that she had a direct knowledge of objective reality, and her 'Objectivist' movement had a considerable vogue in the sixties. Like most anarcho-capitalists, she is convinced of the truth of her own views, which to others appear mere dogma.And in my edition, the paragraph immediately ends. The next paragraph begins, ""Amongst anarcho-capitalist apologists, the economist Murray Rothbard is probably the most aware of the anarchist tradition.""Again, this outrageous error has been corrected in the Internet excerpt of Demanding the Impossible. But it provides additional proof that Peter Marshall presumes to write about books and authors that he has never read. Ayn Rand's attack on anarcho-capitalism (in ""The Nature of Government,"" one essay in her The Virtue of Selfishness) is so clear that Marshall could only make this error by failing to have even read the author whose views he is describing.These are only two of Marshall's numerous factual errors which demonstrate a shocking lack of basic standards of scholarship. After all, a book is not a Usenet posting; one is supposed to spend months or years in study, fact-checking, re-writing, and so on.Some similar errors appear in Ulrike Heider's Anarchism: Left, Right and Green. Once again, there are errors so gross that the only possible explanation is that Heider presumes to write about books she has never read.A few examples of her poor scholarship:""Menger is considered the founder of the Austrian School of Economics, which continued to refine its theory of monetary value until the middle of the 20th century. The most prominent descendent of this school of thought is is monetarist Milton Friedman, the economic authority for such politicians as Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, and others."" Anarchism: Left, Right, and Green, p.100.Milton Friedman is not and never has had any affiliation with the Austrian School. In fact, he is the most famous member of the rival Chicago School, which even a minimal study of the differences between free-market economists would have revealed.""If it weren't for their obsession with work and their misanthropic outlook, one might mistake Rand's heroes for left-wing bohemians. They are always Anglo-Saxon Americans."" ibid, p.105Francisco d'Anconia, one of the four major heroic characters in Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged is of South American nationality.""Roark's rival, the mediocre architect Peter Keaton...""ibidThe character's name is in fact Peter Keating. While the error is trivial, it does indicate that Heider sees no need to get the basic facts straight when she discusses a book. The Fountainhead is divided into four sections, each named for one major character; ""Peter Keating"" is the title of the first section. It would be very hard to miss, unless you never read the book (or wrote from memory years afterwards).Reversing her previous confusion about the Austrian vs. the Chicago schools of economics, Heider appears to attribute monetarist policy prescriptions to Rothbard: ""The monetarist road out of such misery must lead through a depression, the 'painful but necessary process by which the free market rids itself of the excesses and errors of the boom.' [quotation Rothbard's] Rothbard recommends that the government do the exact opposite of what the Keynesians suggest: it should simply abandon its policy of inflation by giving the free market reign and by reinstating the gold standard."" ibid, p.131.Again, Rothbard spent the better part of his academic career attacking monetarism and the Chicago school of economics with which monetarism is associated.I have been informed by admirers of Murray Bookchin that Heider's work contains similar gross errors about eco-anarchism. Since this is not my field of expertise, I do not presume to point them out, but it would not surprise me.It is one thing to violently disagree with an author, and to express one's disagreement in a book. It is another matter entirely to get basic facts wrong; so wrong, in fact, that it casts doubt on whether the author read the books he or she presumes to write about. """,0
I finished this book as fast as I could. I felt the author was on another wavelength to the reader. I didn't care that the story was about this Georgie fellow. He seemed peripheral and the written perspective on him  oblique. The writing was good and I may try some other of the authors works  but the plot was feeble. Try Pat McCabe's breakfast on Pluto for energy and  a raw story or Ian McEwan's Amsterdam for a page turner with a plot of some  interest. Thumbs down for this one.,0
"This book is a tragic waste of time and is representative of the Cowering European Ethos that will destroy that continent.  It is written primarily for an ignorant British audience consisting of people too simple to understand basic principles of home improvement and too cowardly to defend themselves.  More than half the book consists of keeping yourself safe from your own house falling apart.  The rest of the book tells you stupid things like, ""a brick in your house could be considered an offensive (illegal) weapon."" I'm sure this is true in the half-wit nanny state Across the Pond, but not so much in what's left of the Land of the Free.  If you want a good picture of the mindset that allowed a bunch of punks to riot in London this Summer while everyone stood politely and helplessly by, take a look at this book. This was the first item I borrowed from the Kindle Lending Library and I am so happy I paid nothing for it because it is a literary vampire that will suck the life force out of anyone misfortunate enough to buy it.Sorry to go on so much about this book, but in 400+ reviews I've done on Amazon, this is the worst thing I've seen so far.  I wish there was a Zero Star option.",0
"I was so excited about reading this book. All of the other reviews give it so much praise. Plus, it seems like a book I would like; I love historical novels, have a good sense of humor, love adventures, and am always drawn to a good satire. Unfortunately, nothing about this novel lived up to my expectations.This novel follows Flashman through his adventures with the British Army during their Afghanistan War. My problem with the novel is based solely on the character Flashman, but that's a big problem since these are his memoirs. As all of the other reviews point out, Flashman is a total rogue. He is a coward, he's dishonest, he is a murderer, a rapist, an adulterer, a theif, etc. You name a bad trait, and Flashman excels at it, and he always gets away with it. That is where I differ in opinion with everyone else about this book. When Flashman rapes a woman, I'm afraid I have problems laughing when he gets away with it. I always wanted him to be caught, and given what he deserves. The fact that I could feel no sympathy for the main character (protagonist???) just ruined the novel for me, and I'm astonished that so many people just love this novel. I guess Flashman's behavior is supposed to be something of a satire over the male's behavior of the 19th century, but there isn't much depth to the satire (and less in Flashman's characterization). I know that a lot of people have obviously found a lot to enjoy in this novel, I can't think of anyone that I would recommend Flashman to (not even my enemies).",0
"I agree with several other people who found it amazing that this is a bestseller. As an author whose books sell poorly right here on Amazon, I wish I knew her secret. I found it disgusting on so many levels, hard to follow, and in the end, just not worth reading. Perhaps something in the last third of the book would have changed my mind, but I couldn't finish it. I can't remember the last time I threw a book into the garbage can, but I looked it over carefully, thought about the very act of throwing out a book, and then dropped it into the trash. I don't regret it.",0
"Like many who were critical of this book, I truly did want to love it. However, the writing was simple and flat, the characters lacked depth or conviction and the ending was a huge let down. Jacob was infuriating as he claimed to love these animals and then becomes sexually sidetracked while his Rosie was being beaten half to death. It made me sick to my stomach. Over and over, he continued to behave like a helpless child while this animal was brutalized. Time and again, he is either incredibly violent or he is impotent and seemingly defenseless. In the end, each conflict is suddently and hastily resolved with little authenticity. What a shame as this could have been a deeply moving and engaging story.",0
It was a good story idea - don't know what happened.  Maybe author was trying to milk as much revenue as possible?  Don't know.  The whole first 5 books could have been 2 and I won't bother with the next when it comes out.,0
"I would rate this higher if I could. There aren't, in my opinion enough superlatives to do this stirring Naval story justice. It's the story of the heroic H.M.S Ulysses and her crew who are ordered to undertake the escort of a convoy to Russia across the merciless and dangerous North Atlantic. For a crew that is at the end of it's tether after months of battle, it's almost beyond belief.It's a story of survival, for both the Ulysses and her crew against insurmountable odds. A story of men who have been pushed beyond their mental, emotional and physical limits, who don't at first realise that they will be called upon to give even more.It's a journey fraught with difficulty, battle against enemy air attack, roving U-Boats harrying the convoy at every opportunity. Then there is the harsh and unrelenting environment, cold inducing frostbite, angry seas, freak waves, unrelenting storms, exhaustion.The writing is descriptive, you can almost feel yourself aboard the rolling, ice encrusted decks of the Ulysses. There is a wonderful cross section of characters who are well fleshed out. It's a stirring, heroic story that will stay in a reader's mind.",1
"Another fantastic, mind-gripping read, holding its audience from page one. Bloodline spins the tale of a family-run pharmaceutical conglomerate.  Roffe and Sons has been passed down to the heirs of Samuel Roffe's family, Sam Roffe, the only male descendant and holder of the controlling interest of the company, Anna Roffe married to Walther Gassner, Ivo Palazzi, married to Simonetta Roffe, Charles Martel married to Helene Roffe and Sir Alec Nichols' mother had been a Roffe. Samuel Roffe, founder of the company, had decided from the beginning that his company never go public.  His theory, ""Never let a friendly fox into your hen house.  One day he's going to get hungry.""  When Sam Roffe (an experienced climber) dies in a mysterious mountain climbing accident, Elizabeth inherits his controlling interest in the company.  Suddenly, life-threatening events begin to happen to her as she holds onto her great-great grandfather's wishes after finding a book telling the story of Samuel Roffe's life and the tense, emotional and physical struggle he endured to build the company from the ground up.  In her great-great grandfather's memory and approach, she is determined to keep the company private and uncover the person responsible for the evil doings within the upper echelon (that being one of four of her cousins) or possibly her father's right-hand man, Rhys Williams.  Rhys, not being a member of the family, was brought into the company by Elizabeth's father, however, unless he married a Roffe, in this case, Elizabeth (since she was the only female left), would be unable to sit on the Board of Directors.  Williams was always kind to Liz (is it merely business or personal?) who grew up without a father's presence in her life (just the comforts of his money).  Liz felt, even though she harbored strong feelings for Rhys, she could not afford to trust him or anyone until she uncovered the person out to destroy all that Samuel Roffe had built.  Each cousin has their own issues; Anna Roffe's husband is out to destroy their children, Ivo Palazzi is leading a double life with two families, Charles is being lead around by Helene as a boy toy, Sir Alec has married Vivian, a wild, crazy party girl and Rhys has worked long and hard his adult life for Sam without the benefit of even a share of stock in the multimillion dollar business.  Each one has their own agenda for forcing first Sam and now Elizabeth to have the company go public and thereby attaining the financial means to destroy the ""fly in the ointment"" of their respective lives.  I could not put this book down until the last page was turned.  Sheldon is the ""master of storytelling.""",1
"As readers of science-fiction, we have been treated to many novels about our famous red neighbor over the years.  Whether it be the invading conqueror of H.G. Wells' or the blood and thunder pulp of Burroughs, or even the more scienfitic approaches of Bova or Bear, Mars always seems to fascinate the human mind, holding on and never letting go.With that said, Red Mars is the best novel written on the subject of colonization.  Robinson must have spent years researching this novel, and it shows in every page, as every detail is correct and meticulous.  His story of a hundred colonists selected to start our next frontier is riveting, and Robinson creates rounded characters with their own hopes, fears, and quirks.  They orbit each other, loving, distrusting, hating, always moving back and forth as the years roll on.  The planet changes them in ways they could never suspect.  That's one aspect of this novel.As always, Earth is never far behind, and Robinson also embroils us in the politics of our world, taking our pettiness and applying it to an entire planet, more interested in the bottom line than scientific research and human exploration.  And yet, through all of this, Robinson is speaking, telling us how colonization could be done, how it should be done, in his writing that's second to none.Everything in this book shuffles together to create a mosiac of the future.  Red Mars is about Mars, it's about colonists, it's about humanity, about people, about hope, about dreams.  I defy anyone to get past the engrossing beginning and not want to read the novel, or to avoid taking sides during the terraforming arguments.  This novel is a classic work and remains among, if not the, best novel Kim Stanley Robinson has ever written",1
"Therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee-exactly what was Donne conveying to us? The fortuitous nature of  existence, or the unbiased treatment of fate, or the luring equivocation of  individuality?  In the pitifully short three days, no, better be accurate,  two and a half days during a crucial advance for the republic forces in  Spain, Hemingway leads us toward the bullpen, behind which hid a chimera  that is to hunt us all our lives with the echo of Donne's famed line.Hemingway draws every little details together as a pounding fist-beating  recursive chimes into the readers' ears. And with the slower, more  passionate journey into Jordan's memory and future in a way, we become  enthralled as well to the question of choice. How will he choose? Jordan, a  formal Spanish professor in the University of Montana, chooses to foresake  the capitalist luxury of America and pursues the life as a republic  dynamiter in Spain.There is no question of individuality, only a  question of choice, a choice between masses and not identities.  All this  remains intact until Robert's own vision is no longer able to see between  simple black and white in the Spanish mountains where he prepares to blow  up a bridge during a republic offensive. His comrades are not all  communists, nor are his enemies all fascists; these men die not for an  ideal, but for an idea. And as he grows to love the rough Spaniards around  him: shrewd yet cowardly Pablo, thoughtful hunter Ansemlo, strong and  foreseeing Pilar, and most of all, a young woman ravaged many times by  fascist soldiers, Jordan starts to doubt the path he chooses. And between  life and death, ideal and reality, he waivers.Pablo is a sharp thread  that seams between characters and draws Jordan on with questions; he  appears cowardly despite his heroic records as a guerilla leader, and his  own dawdling conviction towards the idea of republic pricks Jordan's own  sense of duty. Especially with more and more emotional involvement  (dependency) on Maria's love, Jordan is wondering whether enough killing is  enough killing for a vague concept. Pablo's seemingly growing discontent,  as a part of a mass, is complemented by his woman Pilar's undying strength.  She reads palms and smells death, and it is through her strong faith in the  union of freedom seekers that the guerrilla group stays together. But  exactly ""for whom"" the bell tolls? For the Spaniards who shed blood among  themselves with visible strings from Moscow? Yes, warfare befalls all, no  one is missed by the silent blow although some can smell its scent and  others shun its path. A dangerous sadness identifies Pablo while an  optimistic cheerfulness characterizes Pilar, why are they essentially the  same ""lot"" then? Because Hemingway shows us, through the interaction of  specter of differences, a single vibration enlivens every frequency on the  scale. Robert Jordan is a mere node not knowing which direction to lean  towards, especially as he is starting to doubt the vibration.America  hasn't had her share of good wars, but what happens in one war is reflected  in the next, or isn't it? If one strong man's mentality comes tumbling down  because the buttress isn't strong enough, why shouldn't the next one fumble  as well? It tolls for thee, and there are a million ""thee"" out there  blindly believing they are the only ""thee"". They hear the same ringing,  although each believes he is able to distinguish a unique frequency; and  they die, their deaths as mere statistics. Thus it is actually an oxymoron  Hemingway presents through Robert Jordan's developing anxieties; he feels  ""tricked"" into believing the impact he himself can make in the war, as a  part of a hovering mass, instead, he recovers pieces of individuality when  he is physically and emotionally removed from the same mass. So at the  beginning, he lays on one stretch of pine forest floor and hears this bell  chime calling him to begin, he joins the guerilla band; at the end, he is  wounded and is left behind to lay on the same stretch of pine forest floor,  and he hears this bell chime calling him to end. The integration and  disintegration mark his journey from blindness to sight.Two and a half  days, who ever lives out their entire existence in such a short period?  Jordan does, and he sees so far into the pattern of living that he does  regret the ultimate choice he makes, not as a soldier, or a leftist, but as  a man redeemed through the moral bath of contemplation.",1
I found the book so interessting right from the beginning to the end. It starts outwith a death and it keeps you wondering how it all is going to end. To have an insidechance to see how circus people lived and how they cared for the animals gives you thatchance to 'run away with the circus',1
"For me, this book was like making a dear friend, and then bidding him farewell. I tried to savor this story, but couldn't put it down either. I was so sad when I got to the last page and it was over.I think the other reviews cover the storyline well...and I'm not a fan of giving away endings, but in general, it has vivid character development, authentic to the period and circus era of the depression years... and despite some graphic scenes (which add to rather than take away), it was a great, great read.I suspect it will be hailed as one of summer 2008's top beach reads...and will be on my recommend list to anyone who will listen for a long time to come.",1
"For me, Without Remorse is Clancy's breakthrough. He takes his characters emotionally to the next level. Predictably the action and wartime policy intrigue feature prominently, as John Kelly (aka Clark) is dispatched to Vietnam to free a POW. But the other half of the novel is about his vendetta against a crime syndicate in Baltimore. What did they do to face the wrath of this one-man wrecking crew? They killed a girl who nurtured him in a time of need. Kelly's revenge is brutal amd just. There's an interrogation scene halfway through the book involving a decompression chamber that pushes the emotional boundaries of the novel and moved me to tears. The ending chase sequence explains how Kelly reemerges as Clark later in the Ryanverse timeline.",1
"This book was enchanting.  Immediately you become under it's spell from the first words. The mystery, history, action, and love stories of the circus all wrapped up in one.The story is about Jacob Jankowski, the circus vet.  Under tragic circumstances, he joins a second rated circus and becomes entangled into all their lives, whether he wants to or not.  Bouncing between his current status, which is in a nursing home at the age of 93 or 99 (he's not sure) and his circus life, there is a mystery deep in the heart of it.",1
One of the classics that everyone should read. It is also one of the most profound books that is this short.,1
A really good read. A peek into the workings of the old time circus life along with memorable characters and storyline. Love the way the auther potrayed Jacob as a crochety old man. Couldn't put the book down.,1
great book.  clarence larkin does a great job with this book in explaining revelations and makes it easy to understand,1
"It is really hard to be able to write this many books, so many pages each and still keep a good story going. I have read all five and it is really hard to wait for 3 more years. I'll have to keep living to finish the story!!!!!LOL",1
"James Patterson did an outstanding job on this book.  I am looing forward  to reading Cat and Mouse.  I have a great deal of books that have good  storyline, and a good overall mystery element; but the ending is weak in  reference to the books make-up.  Along came a spider had the total package,  good storyline, good mystery element, an ending that was unsettling and  fantastic.",1
"I sampled this book because it's so popular and the price was right. The author's voice captured me with the authenticity of the elderly Jacob. Literally seconds after I finished reading the sample, I hit ""buy now."" One of the most brilliant techniques in the book, and my personal favorite, is the little jolt the author created every time the point of view switches from young Jacob to old Jacob, and it makes you flinch as though you too have been wrenched from the prime of your life into the body of a decrepit codger in a nursing home.The ending is perfect and satisfyingThe scenes depicting cruelty to animals were emotionally difficult to read, though. If that kind of thing bothers you, you may not enjoy the story.",1
This book had you from the start.  Just when you thought you had figured it out there was a new twist.,1
"Robert Jordan is one of the most exciting, interesting and principled fictional characters I've ever had the pleasure to read about.  Set during the fascist take over in 1930s Spain, For Whom the Bell Tolls is a novel that will easily stand the test of time (not much of a prediction since it was written in 1940) and is one of the finest books in the English language.  Jordan, an American, is the main character who comes to Europe to fight the good fight against Franco's military thugs.  The reader is given a fascinating in-depth look into his psyche, where he reflects on his fellow soldiers, plans for warmaking and the justifications and rationalizations along the war trail.Pablo's another character who is burned into your consciousness long after you've finished reading.  A fellow rebel (they weren't rebels in the true sense, since they were fighting for a government they had duly elected; however, they have all the characteristics of guerrillas in that the Spanish military waged an immediate and violent war against that very democratically elected government), the reader is left wondering just how committed he is to the cause.  There is an incredible flashback story detailing Pablo's orchestration of the sadistic torture and humiliation of a group of wealthy fascist sympathizers.  The vivid description involved in this passage is nothing short of extraordinary.Of course the true democrats, fighting for the Republic against the well financed and better armed fascist military, eventually lose the war, but having that foreknowledge does nothing to detract from the cliff-hanger like feelings brought about by the various battles and journeys the rebel crew embarks on.This is the best, and most accessible of all of Hemingway's works.  If someone is interested in reading Hemingway, For Whom the Bell Tolls is the perfect starting point.  As for Hemingway's style of prose, what more can be said, except that it's brilliant, enthralling and readily accessible to the common reader, unlike Joyce and Faulkner.  In my opinion, every American should give some time to Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls.  Commitment, intelligence, sacrifice and fighting for the well being of your fellow man is all there along with a terrific love story. Given that the average American attention span is like a ferret on a double espresso (Dennis Miller), very few will give books like For Whom the Bell Tolls a try with the mass of pop TV garbage out there.An excellent companion to the book is the documentary film ""The Good Fight"" narrated by Studs Terkel.  It gives a mini history lesson of the Spanish Civil War and specifically focuses on a group of U.S. citizens (the Abraham Lincoln Brigade) who heroically went abroad and fought along side the democrats against Franco and his fascist military thugs.",1
"I'm going to write a very brief review of this book, so I'll just cover a few bases.  To begin with, I think the first three Song of Ice and Fire books are top-tier fantasy novels that easily contend with the likes of Lord of the Rings and the Wheel of Time.  The fourth book, however, A Feast for Crows, left ol' Martin's fanbase decidedly divided.  The book, to me, was basically a well-written intermission of sorts that served to move playing pieces into their places.  I did rather enjoy it, though.  Since that book covered the characters from a certain geography only, then A Dance with Dragons covers the characters who were not in Feast for Crows.  Now, since nothing momentous happened in A Feast for Crows, and nothing momentous was reported from the other characters offscreen, then it should have been a logical conclusion that A Dance with Dragons would be of a similar pace and low-impact plotting as A Feast for Crows.  This turns out to be the case.  A Dance with Dragons is really well done, but it's just very slow and not much happens to advance the overall plot.  There are some really intriguing events being set up, however, and since the book is so well done I found myself really enjoying it, albeit it not nearly as much as the first three books.  I can see why some people are disappointed, though.  Nothing happens in this book that you would want and expect to happen, and since A Feast for Crows was basically a plot doldrum, everyone seemed to hope that A Dance with Dragons would be a fireball of epic grandeur.  Its my opinion that since the last two books were basically huge intermissions of plot organizing, it stands to reason that the final two books of the Ice and Fire series will be mind boggling in scope and action.  In any case, this book leaves me looking ever more forward to the next installment, and let's just hope the intermission phase is over with.",1
"""Men are men and women women, no matter which side of the Wall we were born on. Good men and bad, heroes and villains, men of honor, liars, cravens, brutes...we have plenty, as do you.""The scope of Martin's world increases. The breadth of his characters grows by magnitudes. And the epic expands ever outwards.This book concludes little and alludes to a lot. It's not as fulfilling in and of itself, but ""Dance"" propels Martin's worlds forward in large leaps.Tyrion is back, and he was sorely missed in ""Feast for Crows"". Jon Snow's character evolves to put on a display of strength touched on in previous books but solidified in this tome. Like his previous novels, each chapter comes from the perspective of a different character. While some we know, Martin has the audacity to introduce even more characters to his historic rainbow of interconnected plots.""Dance"" is as big and bold as the preceding novels. It's dark, heavy, and written with a lusciously lavish hand - like its four predecessors. I can't understand what readers don't like about this one short of the fact that it doesn't bring the stories to an end. But that's the fun, right?",1
"Kim Stanley Robinson's RED MARS is a monumental work, the beginning of a three book trilogy spanning well over 1,500 pages. Robinson manages to elaborate on points from the most mundane issues of gossip, affairs, and body image; to...well the colonization of Mars. RED MARS is an important work, and I think well grounded, on the relationship between human beings and their place of dwelling. Mars is a living creature here, and mankind manages to twist it in every way from our ideas, objectification, and the inevitable destruction at the hand of these conflicting views.This book is a must for any fan of hard science-fiction. A passionate, researched, and thorough account of the theoretical colonization of Mars...with the occasional lull of thirty to forty pages of terrain under its scientific name, under scientific terms.",1
"Wow. I hope that's not all I can say about this book, but that's where I'll start. Wow.Every time I hesitate to think I'll find a book that is captivating, entertaining, and that will keep my interest and keep me thinking about its characters long after the book is over, I somehow seem to find myself happily surprised. Water for Elephants was one of those books. It was really that good.I heard good things about it, always saw it on the shelves at bookstores, but it wasn't until recently that I decided to give it a chance. Why? A book about a circus in the depression/prohibition era is probably as far away from my ""normal"" reading zone as I can get.  But I'm telling you - it doesn't matter! Not one bit.Entertaining and engrossing from the very first chapter, I was taken away on this journey with the characters. Nothing short of fascinating, in ways I wouldn't have thought possible.  Part love story, part coming of age, this is at its roots, a story about life and the unexpected paths it may take. I really came to love the character of Jacob, and sympathize with his situation and his love for animals. It's been over a week since I've finished the novel, and I still think about the characters every day.  I really got caught up in their world which is something, I must say, is sometimes way too rare in the books I read. Many are good stories, but with Water for Elephants, I really felt like I was traveling along with them in their adventures. A pleasant surprise.Overall, I have already recommended to more than a few friends, and would encouragingly recommend it here. It may just be one of those precious few books that when you finish it, you stop and, at a loss for words, say - wow.",1
This happens to be just as good as A Storm Of Swords and beats A Feast by a long mile. I'm a little upset at the negative reviews that I'm seeing and am wondering if its just that people are upset that Martin took so long to write it or that the pace needs to be faster or something along those lines. A lot of people fail to grasp that its still in the middle where things aren't lightening quick but picking up speed from the fourth book. I have to confess that I'm not completely done but am more than two thirds done and I've had to pull myself away from it so I don't finish it too fast. Anyway I highly recommend this wonderful book and can't wait till the next one comes out!,1
"I give this book a 2.6.  All those people Jacob's father helped in that little town and no one came forward in his time of tragedy?  It just didn't seem realistic to me.  Someone from immigrant stock with the pluck and drive to get into Cornell vet school is not likely to founder in this situation, nor just dismissively to walk away from his final exams.  Jacob wasn't a pampered trust fund baby; he'd probaby had it a bit rough all along. The rest of the story is just a contrivance built upon an unbelievable premise.",1
"I love this series, but at book 5 I am thinking:  get on with it, already.  Seems the MAIN plot should move along by now.  The dragon lady seems to be taking her time getting to the castle, don't you think?",1
"Tom Clancy's longtime hero, former CIA analyst Jack Ryan, has managed to assume the Presidency, Gerald Ford-style, without ever having been elected on a presidential ticket.Unlike Ford, however, Ryan had never been elected to any public office at all. Asked by President Durling to serve as Vice President, after the previous Vice President is forced to resign in the wake of a sex scandal, Ryan reluctantly agrees to take on a largely ceremonial office. The catch for the non-politician Ryan, however, is that the Vice-Presidency is only a heartbeat away from the most burdensome job in the world, and one which Ryan shivers at the thought of undertaking.Then the incredible happens, when a grief-striken Japanese pilot who lost family in a brief Japanese-American shooting war, mans a jumbo jet during Ryan's swearing-in ceremony and crash lands into the Capitol, thereby all but obliterating government. The President, First Lady, the entire Supreme Court, nearly all the Cabinet and most Senators and members of Congress are killed in a few calamitous moments.This leaves Ryan, who survived by a sheer fluke, to assume an office which he frankly dreads approaching. A complete political outsider, Ryan has an excellent working knowledge of the government, but close to zero political instincts. A populist and technophile of the sort both idolized and unelected by America, Ryan must bumble through his grief and shock at the horror which has befallen his nation and attempt to lead it. His hostility toward any form of ideology that appears other than starkly pragmatic, however, is ultimately disappointing. In the guise of non-partisan vigor, Clancy has Ryan deliver a series of startlingly conservative speeches praising a flat tax and denouncing abortion rights.If Ryan's syrupy claims to integrity are occassionally enough to set one's teeth on edge, Clancy establishes a magnificent character in &quot;India&quot;, the Prime Minister of the world's largest democracy. Referring to her only by the name of the country she represents, Clancy cleverly harkens back to the medieval language of kings, who refer to one another by the name of their countries. India is a nearly Picassoan study in minimalism. Only a few lines here and there richly summon up the mental image of the face of Benazir Bhutto masking the mind of Indira Gandhi. India's supernaturally beautiful English conveys all at once the history of her nation, her class origins and educational background, her exquisite mendacity and diplomatic sophistication.One masterpiece is a conversation between India and Ryan in which he attempt to secure her promise of safe passage of American vessels through the Indian ocean. India effortlessly evades Ryan's direct request a number of ways, each time protesting offense and hurt feelings on behalf of her nation. While India is written as a villain in Clancy's novel, conspiring against America, her delicious sophistication elevates her far above the supposedly well-intentioned lummox that is America. India's protests on behalf of her &quot;sovereign nation&quot;, as Ryan attempts to shove her military around, will resonate deeply amongst Clancy's international audience, as he is surely aware.In the meantime, America's vulnerability is a huge source of inspiration to any number of enemies, both foreign and domestic. Ryan's forte, and Clancy's as well, is in the field of international relations, and an array of hostile nations (India, China, Iran and Iraq) plan intricate attacks on the American homeland and its new President.Clancy has a speechwriter inform Jack Ryan that his use of language, while correct and to the point, is far from poetic. Clearly, the same can be said of Tom Clancy. But what Clancy lacks in artful turns of phrase, he makes up for in scholarship. None of the attacks dreamed up by foreign powers against America are, in themselves, totally unbelieveable: it is only their sheer number and simulteneity that gives &quot;Executive Orders&quot; a far-fetched quality.Tom Clancy's immense learning about weapons systems, military manoeuvers, Pentagon and CIA operations, is put to superb use. Even an outbreak of the Ebola virus in Zaire, which is quickly capitalized upon by the new United Islamic Republic (composed of former enemies Iran and Iraq), is described with striking and quite remarkable clinical accuracy. The governmental institutions he describes are entirely real. Clancy's gift is for taking the world of politics as he expertly knows it to be, and rearranging a few pieces on the chessboard to suggest fictional events evolving from familiar institutions.A large amount of the pleasure derived from a Clancy novel comes from simply being able to follow it. The acronyms are endless, yet largely accurate and non-fictional. Clancy is the ultimate man's man, sharing his war stories in warmly confidential tones, allowing the reader the great vicarious pleasure of merely comprehending: testing each piece of data and finding most to be accurate and real.While many readers will note a kind of &quot;jump the shark&quot; quality to Ryan's extraordinary assumption of the Presidency---for where else had he to go in Clancy's imaginary career trajectory?---the book has an indisputably educational quality for students of geopolitics. World leaders use subjective impressions gleaned at diplomatic receptions to decide upon military gambits. Everyone in politics and in the military has an agenda, noble or not, and all leaders use a range of discursive strategies to communicate with the public, the international community, their cabinets, and with other leaders. None of these 'voices' is entirely sincere or truthful, and some are not a bit of either.Clancy will establish in his readers the important instinct toward looking for the ever-present subtext behind every public speech and pronoucement, and for this reason alone, at least one or two of his novels should be attempted by any serious student of politics.",1
"After watching the movie (which I liked), my sister gave me the book. I was really excited about reading it, I know it's a bestseller and that I was probably going to like it. I admit, the real reason that made me curious about this story was that Jacob, the protagonist, is a veterinarian, like me.Jacob is a young man who is about to end his studies, when life gives him an awful surprise. His parents are dead, and he is left with nothing. Running from his old life, he jumps into the train of a circus called The Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. He is saved from being hurled out of the train only because he's a veterinarian. The circus have a lot of animals, and they need to be taken care of.Jacob is young, innocent and a veterinarian with a big love for animals. Taking care of the animals makes him happy, and that is how he met Marlena. Beautiful, fragile, but married.I really liked this book. I loved how the author described life at the circus. It's obvious she investigated about circus, the people who worked at them, how they function, and their animals.But what I liked more was the writing. The story is told by old Jacob. He's 90 years old, or 93, and his memories about the circus, his wife and his life don't die. He starts narrating the story, but suddenly you realize you are reading young Jacob while being at the circus.Overall, Water for Elephants was a book that grabbed me from the beginning. Although I wanted more emotion between Marlena and Jacob, it's a romantic story, full of action, love for animals and a magnificent circus.",1
"If Tomorrow Comes was my first encounter with Sidney Sheldon and I would have to say it was good. I didn't know what to expect from the book, after only reading it on a recommendation but was glad that I took the advice.The book moves quickly and at fast pace. I found myself expecting the story to go one way and then surprised along the way.I also thoroughly enjoyed the various 'cons' and 'schemes' that were told in the story. Makes me wish I was as creative.I give it 4 stars.",1
"A Song of Ice and Fire is every bit as good as you've heard, and then some. ADoD drags on a big slow in the middle parts as much of the story feels already known after AFfC, but Martin includes enough new developments and plot twists to keep you engaged long enough to reach the real fun part - the last 1/4 or so of the book when all the storylines begin really progressing and the table is set for the final two books. The Winds of Winter can't come soon enough!",1
"To say that A Song of Ice and Fire is a beloved franchise is an understatement. Many individuals, excluding myself, felt that George R.R. Martin's last outing ""A Feast for Crows"" was in poor show.  It was so strange to see the forums light up with outrage over a book that was, by my observation, one of the best in the series.  Two of the most common complaints were that ""Feast"" didn't feature the most beloved characters in the series, i.e. Daenerys, Tyrion, Jon Snow, and that it didn't feature a truly memorable scene like the Red Wedding from ""A Storm of Swords"".  That all changes in ""A Dance with Dragons"".  Written as a companion piece with ""Feast"", ""Dance"" features all of the northern and western characters that were missing from the fourth novel.More likely than not, the most common complaint of ""A Dance with Dragons"" will be the tremendous length of the book.  ""Dance"" is the longest entry in the series, and just as the case with Feast, it has a certain unhurried feel to it. In all fairness to the complainers, ""Dance's"" narrative does overlap with ""Feast's"" narrative for about the first 600 or so pages.  It is the investable result of ""Feast's"" own incompleteness, and the way its manuscript was culled from that of ""Dance"" to begin with.As previously mentioned, the three most beloved characters (Danny, Jon, and Tyrion) make a return.  In fact, they carry the bulk of the plot this time around, which depending on whether you enjoy their characters could be a good or bad thing.  Both ""Feast"" and ""Dance"" follow the culmination of the third novel ""Storm"", and Martin takes great care and deliberation to follow the main characters as Westeros tries to rebuild their nation in the aftermath of the War of Five Kings.  There are times in the novel where things are slow going, and it makes you wonder whether Martin just threw in the towel and is trying to ride this thing out.  But the cumulative effect of the novel, once it is over, is formidable, proving that Martin hasn't lost any of his mastery of writing what is considered the greatest fantasy epic of all time.  It really takes reading the whole book to appreciate what Martin has created this time around.Up north at the Wall, Jon Snow, now serving as the 988th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, has his hands full.  The Other's, also known as the undead menace that is destroying everything north of the Wall, are driving the Wildling's towards the wall, leaving Jon to figure out what to do about it.  On top of that, the self-proclaimed King of Westeros, Stannis Baratheon, is becoming an arrogant nuisance who hopes to unite the entire north by raiding the land.Elsewhere, everyone is waiting for Dany Targaryen, who has claimed the city of Meereen as her own, to make her intentions clear.  All are somewhat bewildered by the fact that Dany has chosen to take up residence in Meereen, abandoning her claim to the thrown, at least for the time being.  Dany is determined to do right by the people of Meereen, whom she has liberated from slavery by banning that institution entirely.  It is a decision that has crippled the economy.  It also made a whole mess of people angry and upset at her decision.  These people have begun to assassinate her soldiers, leaving the city a very unsafe place for Dany and her followers.And finally there is Tyrion, fleeing Westeros after murdering his father with a crossbow, he finds himself in about the most humiliating and dire circumstances that he has come across thus far in the series.  Later in the book, we get to see a bit more of what transpired in the lives of Arya, Cersei, Jamie, and the others.  Meanwhile, underlying everything is the sense that there is fresh chaos about to erupt with the realm.  It is only a question of where and when, someone will strike the first blow.As expected, Martin's writing is nothing short of amazing.  Beyond the prose, the editing is something to be marveled. Thousand-page epic fantasy doorstoppers are plentiful, but you don't often find one that manages to balance multiple plot threads and vast ensemble casts so smoothly that readers never get bewildered, lost, or just plain bored out of their minds.Once you dive into the meat of this novel, you'll know without a doubt, that you are back in the Seven Kingdoms, where lives are cheap, words are wind, and winter is coming.",1
"I loved this book! I found it very easy to read and get lost in the story. I liked how it was told from present-day Jacob's view looking back on his life. This helped me understand what type of man he was. I felt like I was there will him throughout this story. The setting of the Great Depression made the struggles and triumphs mean so much more. I found all the main characters; Jacob, August, Marlena, Walter, and even the elephant, Rosie, to be extremely poignant, especially when you remember the story is told from an elderly Jacob. The transitions from ""memories"" to ""current day"" Jacob were very smooth and I didn't feel distracted or lost during these changes. If you love a romance novel with hero and heroine, then you must read this book!",1
"i am really tired of the Thrones.  it almost feels like someone co-wrote this last one.  i like to read while i eat and the descriptions of death and mayhem are much more disgusting than the first four.Also, he is adding new people and basically ignoring our old friends and enemies.  i'm half way through the last one (thank goodness it is the last one) and i'm just not interested anymore but i'll finish it because i've spent too much time on it.",1
"While I would not recommend this book to a young reader due to a couple pretty explicate scenes I would recommend it to any adult who just loves a good book.  Once I started reading it I could not put it down.  I hesitated reading it because I didn't think that the subject matter would be interesting, but I was so wrong.  This is a wonderfully written book.",1
"What a terrific read!  It personally took me a few chapters to get into the book, seemed slow in parts but the story line made up for it.  My sisters ranted and raved about this book when it first hit the scene in 2006 I believe and I just read it-- and it was worth the read.  The depth and substance of the book was what kept me interested and invested in the characters.*Taken from another reviewer because it's said so well and I believe the same thing of the book: ""Water for Elephants is a great book for a summer read.  It's obvious that the author did her research into the time period (post-Depression America), and the subject matter (traveling circuses).  According to the author's note at the end of the book, many of the compelling anecdotes in the story were based upon real events, culled from the diaries and personal histories of old-time circus performers.  As a result, Water for Elephants is a novel that boasts the rare combination of being both entertaining and informative.""",1
"I bought this book out of curiousity and the big hoopla over what a ""sleeper hit"" this story had become,I love animals,so I gave it a try.One of the other Amazon customer reviewers said that the main character was talking to a reporter. No, he's not talking to anyone, just us, but I was bothered HOW he was communicating to us.Since everyone else has synopsized the plot ad nauseum. I'll just report the weaknesses in this book.First of all, very little elephant!!! Not Water For Elephant(s), but Water for ELEPHANT, ONE elephant. And very little elephant. Whatever research she did on these animals was tiny, miniscule. I could have gotten more into the mind of pachyderms by watching a Nat.Geo or Animal Planet special.As for his being a veterninarian. I too own horses, been around them and vets for nearly 5 decades. What little circus animal veterinary work Ms. Gruen describes in the book she probably got watching a cable TV station animal special.I also concur with the veterinarian reviewer on the slaughter of the horses. If a horse is forced to watch the other beside it die violently, most likely when it smells all that blood, you can bet the ranch it would break its' halter or rope and be nine miles gone.I also found it very distracting the numerous referrals to minute body languages while the characters talked. Also, even though the story started pretty promising, once Jacob got established as an employee in the circus, it bottomed out into nothing but petty bickerings and jealousies among all the circus employees. Yawn....It was fast reading, but I started hoping the thing would end soon. And, yeah, the animal stampede at the end I wasn't buying. I think Ms. Gruen could have just watched Nat. Geo or Animal Planet replays of elephants gone bonkers on video in circuses and let Rosie the elephant just get even by squishing those who had abused her.",1
I read almost all James Patterson books.  This one was really good and had a surprise ending. Can't put it down,1
What is amazing to me is how close the TV series is to what is in the books.  How they manage some of it is beyond me.  Excellent read!!  Definitely worth reading the whole series.  I could hardly wait to get to each of the books in succession. Very well written. The extensive detail about all the various families and how their interactions ebb and flow or should I say clash and slash sometimes!!,1
"I read the five books in this series because family members were raving about it. Book Five is much better than Book Four, but overall the amount of killing, maiming, deceiving, etc. is too much and, frankly, it is becoming boring. The Enders series is much better, if you're looking for good fantasy. And, of course, the Harry Potter series is the best!",1
I waited months for this to come out in soft cover & it was so worth the wait!  It just keeps getting better!!,1
"I only wish I could read the original text.  The simplicity and frankness, the blend of respect for the individual and appreciation of spirituality--this is the most astonishing work I have ever read.",1
"I had planned on watching the movie first because it looked good and  I can't usually watch a movie and enjoy it if I read and enjoyed the book first and vis versa. However, the book got better reviews than the movie and I didn't want to taint my experience with the story, so I picked up the book first and I'm glad I did.We are deliver the story through Mr. Jacob Jankowsky's ninety, or ninety-three year old memory. He can't remember his age but he remembers his life with the train traveling circus in the 1930's like it was yesterday. We see the excitement of a life as a circus worker and more often then not the dangers that the job presents, especially if you start to fall for the crazy jealous circus trainer's wife.",1
"Growing up in the UK my reading material was an eclectic mixture of Enid Blyton children's adventure novels, Ian Fleming and John Gardner espionage tales and Alistair MacLean wartime escapades. It was in this environment that my love for well crafted tales of suspense, adventure and espionage was fostered and nowhere is this more apparent than in the MacLean thriller WHERE EAGLES DARE.Second among my favorite MacLean works (my all-time favorite being WHEN EIGHT BELLS TOLL) the storyline for WHERE EAGLES DARE was faithfully recreated for the 1960s movie with Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood (not surprising really since MacLean adapted his own novel for the screen).A group of British Commando's along with an American Ranger parachute behind the German lines in World War 2. Their stated mission: the rescue of an American General who has been captured by the Nazi's and taken to a mountaintop fortress.Of course like many I had seen the movie several times before finally settling down to read the book, but settle down I did and what a ride MacLean treated us to. The action is well described with white-knuckle realism and MacLean's complex and intricate plotting is both well structured and compelling. For those unfamiliar with either the book or the novel there is also a nice twist that to this day has me marveling at its pure ingenuity.Okay so the dialogue may not be the best, but I for one do not read MacLean novels for their dialogue.For adventure novels, MacLean is the master as much as Agatha Christie is the Queen of the whodunnit. I wish that the entire series of novels would be reprinted for a new generation to enjoy.",1
It's a very imaginative story that you don't want to end. My only complaint would be that the bad language is a bit much.,1
"I didn't expect to enjoy this book. I definitely liked it more than I liked the movie. It's clearly fictionalized, and sometimes the characterizations don't quite match up with the actions the characters take, but it was much better written than I expected. I've grown a bit tired of stories about Anne, because most Tudor books seem to be about her, and reading her story from her sister's perspective was a nice alternative.",1
Read this 30 years ago (at least) when it first came out and loved it!  Subsequently read every one as they became available and am delighted to see that this first one is being re-issued as an Audiobook.  Can't wait to  listen to it all over again!  Am sure I will agree with the previous  reviewers about the reading since accents add a wonderful dimension to any  book.  I am a rabid Flashman fan!,1
Alex Cross is such a likable character - exciting in his official capacity - touching as a father.Along Came a Spider keeps you on the edge right up til the end --a MUST READ for suspense lovers .... what a gripping story!!,1
Having read all the Jack Ryan books over the years this is a jewel in the crown. A &#34;Must Read!&#34;,1
"This was my least favorite of Riding Lessons, Flying Changes and Ape House. Sara Gruen has a way of writing about relationships between humans and animals. It is unbelievable the love that is conveyed is incredible.",1
Well written. Gave additional insight to the living conditions in the early days of the circus. Looking forward to seeing the movie. The book should make a great screen play.,1
"I love the novel, Water for Elephants. It is the exciting tale of a young, veterinary student who ends up working for a third-rate, somewhat corrupt, traveling circus. He cares for the circus animals, while encountering danger, episodes of animal cruelty, violence and romance. It is a heart-pounding and endearing tale, told mostly in flashback.  The characters are larger-than-life, from the cruel circus owner, to the sideshow freaks, to the bawdy young ladies who perform for the grinning men - both onstage ... and off. I just loved this book from start to finish. And for those of you who have seen the film, the book has much more action, and less focus on the romantic angle. An action-packed, colorful story. I could not put it down.",1
Best book in the series. I can't wait for the next one. The show isn't enough to get my game of thrones fix,1
"Water for Elephants, by Sara Gruen, is a pleasurable book to read.  Among its many virtues, is Guren's recreation of the atmosphere of depression era America, and a unique circus subculture that existed in what now must be viewed as the lost past.  Leading this tale is a genuinely likeable guy, a rarity in contemporary literature.  This hugely popular book is without serious lessons to preach or meaning to convey.  Rather, it is a good story which provided me with many hours of pleasant diversion.",1
This story grabs you with swirly plots and colorful characters who live an extraordinary life style in the circus. Water for Elephants is for anyone who has a drop of gypsy in their blood or even just wishes they could live out their dreams of adventure.,1
"I really liked this memoir because it talked about one of the campaigns of World War II that Americans just don't hear as much about. In addition, Fraser discussed his role in the fighting in a way that was both clear and realistic. He admits that many of the details are hazy at best after this many years, but the things he remembers are related in a way that brings the other men in his Section to memorable life. Fraser does not shy away from the more grisly aspects of his service, nor does he dwell on them unnecessarily.",1
"It's a long read, but not long enough. Once again just really really good stuff. I have no qualms for spending my money on this one and believe I received good value.",1
"A fantastic story with twists, turns and many change-ups. The Author had many heros and just as many if not more villians doing all kinds of mean and nasty things to the characters.I couldn't wait to pick up the next book!",1
"But alas, George is not edited enough. The story is so great, why must he blunder on about food and send us on wild goose chases before something that affects the plot happens? It's getting worse and worse with each book. The first three were masterpieces. George! I implore you as a fellow author. Let your editors edit!! This blathering does not become your genius.Anyway, I loved the story and characters and so I'm hooked until this is finished. I'm praying for better critique partners and for the author to heed their suggestions.",1
It arrived in excellent condition.I give it a 5 because it looks durable and arrived in such a mint condiiton.i am very pleased with the product and would recommend others to buy it.,1
"In this book we finally get to know Mr. Clark.  Clancy, unlike he does in his other books, focuses a lot on a love story which is the basis for the action in this book.  Although Mr. Clark's military skills are talked about in great description, it is not another military he ends up using them against.  His fight is against drug dealers and pimps, and the story is great.  One has to read it to understand because this is not the typical ""love story"", in fact it is a love story that you would think Clancy would write.  Kudo's to Clancy on his endeavor out of the normal military novel.  I hope we get more books focusing on Mr. Clark and his group, Rainbow Six (another great Clancy book).",1
"Along with its sequels, A Good Clean Fight and Damned Good Show, this is one of the best books to come out of World War II.  The three of them are certainly the liveliest and most entertaining I've read about the air war (along with Len Deighton's Bomber), almost as if Dickens or Tolstoy had been in the RAF.  I think what most distinguishes the three novels is the character of ""Skull"" Skelton, a kind of Candide figure.  An Oxford history don pressed into service as an RAF intelligence officer, ""Skull"" simply cannot resist explaining to the fighter pilots, bomber pilots, military administrators, and other RAF types he is supposed to be encouraging just exactly how practically and morally futile their activities are in a historical context.  He keeps getting kicked around for this, but he keeps on doing it, which brings a profound and even somewhat hopeful dimension to what might otherwise be dismissed as nihilistic thrillers (which Robinson's work unfortunately gets dismissed as judging from its limited availability in libraries and other establishment venues).  ""Skull"" is not the main character-- he just keeps popping up at odd moments.  And that is part of what makes him so effective, because the novels' anti-war theme never gets preachy like Hersey's The War Lover or programatic and repetitive like Heller's Catch 22.These three books should be much more widely available as a unit, although Damned Good Show falls off a little from the first two, as though Robinson was getting discouraged at the sparse response to A Good Clean Fight.",1
"Who can ever say anything negative about this great philosopher poet, artist?  Read, enjoy, and apply to your own life.",1
"I had read this book when it first came out almost 20 years ago. This is a re-read of my favorite Clancey novel, a tribute to one of the best writers of this genre. The tough guy novels of today seem bland by comparison. Today it is about Terrorism and the Middle East. Back then it was about Vietnam and the Soviets. This is masterful story telling.",1
"We can read in an author's note that Sara Gruen has studied elephant behavior.  She has more than studied it she has affectingly captured it in Rosie, a large gray elephant and the one hope of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth, a down at the heels circus trying to make a go of it during the Depression.Now, Rosie wasn't too much of a hope because she was lovable but could not follow any command .  Rosie's only unique characteristic was a seemingly unquenchable thirst for  lemonade.  Her inability to perform was no excuse for the intolerable cruelty visited upon her by August, the callous menagerie director who thought nothing of tossing a lit cigarette into Rosie's open mouth.  He didn't limit his abuse to helpless animals but also mistreated his lovely wife, Marlena.Spellbindingly read by David LeDoux and John Rutledge Jones, Water For Elephants is at its heart the story of three - Jacob, who has lost his parents in a tragic accident, and finds a home with the circus, Marlena and, of course, Rosie.  It's a poignant look at their lives set against an oppressive, sometimes degrading circus world, and a look back at our country during the grueling Depression years.  Most importantly, it's a reminder of the resiliency of human beings and how love can heal.- Gail Cooke",1
Great series - wonderfully entertaining - even better than the HBO series.  You can't go wrong with this book - clear your schedule and start reading!,1
Excellent read-- the best I have read this summer!  I have 6 kids (one only 4 mos old) and read this book in less than a week.  Highly recommended.,1
"This book takes a few pages to find its momentum, which is the ONLY reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five.  The political machinations of the upwardly mobile Boleyn family in their quest to have land, power and titles for their men, while putting their women out as brood mares, is a concept that was ripe for Philippa Gregory's golden touch.This story is told from the point of view of Mary, Anne Boleyn's sister; the first of the two to be sent to Henry VIII's bed (in the novel, she is younger than Anne, but in real life, she was the older of the two).  Anne's cap was set for Henry while Mary was giving birth to his son, and her family's ambition soon gave way to that of her own.  Anne Boleyn does NOT come off well here - she is a vain, selfish woman with no concept of the precedent she set by getting Henry VIII to set aside his first wife for her.  If it could be done FOR her, it could be done TO her.All the innuendo that was present during Anne's time is here:  the hint that one of Anne's miscarried children was conceived in a shocking way, George Boleyn's indiscretions, witchcraft, and the rest made for pages turning late into the night.  Mary's personal story of being married to a man she didn't know, then being bedded by the King, and her fight to keep her children by that King, makes me want to know more about her.  Too sad that she wasn't important enough at the time for anyone to take too much note of her - she was only the Other Boleyn Girl.",1
"When I red the synopsis for this book, I thought I shouldn't read it because I thought it would be too into the occult, and as a Christian, that wouldn't b something for me to read.  Some other Christians read it, and didn't say anything bad about it so I thought I would give it a try.  I'm glad I did!  Don't be frightened!  The occult is just mentioned, and is frowned upon.  It is all right for a Christian to read!Susanna grew up in India, but went to school in England.  On her return visit, she finds Aubrey St. Clare (It is a man!  I've known girls named Aubrey, but this one is a man!).  They fall in love and marry back in England.  Her marriage is all but shattered when she finds out Aubrey is into opium and the occult.  She tries to make the marriage work, but when Aubrey's way of life causes her son to die, she leaves forever.  Before she regrets it, Aubrey dies as well.She decides to leave England and become a nurse, but she never forgives Dr. Damien Adair, the man she blames for Aubrey's downfall and her son's death.  Much to her surprise, she meets up with Damien and, is it love?  Could she love the man that ruined her husband and son?This Victoria Holt book is different because the ending isn't very suspenseful, and the &quot;bad-guy&quot; isn't trying to hurt the heroine.  Still, it is very good, like her others.",1
"George MacDonald Fraser's flawed, but interesting and entertaining recollection of his service in Burma during the latter stages of WW II are well worth reading on their own merit and especially so for his legion ofFlashman: A Novelreaders. Some slice of that readership will be particularly interested to see whether the memoir reveals just how much Flashman reflected the real thinking of the author. Fraser expressed his disdain for such modern ""PC"" readers in a piece excerpted in The Daily Mail around the time of his death in 2008 from another memoir he wrote about his experiences as a movie screenwriter calledThe Light's on at Signpost. Ouch.Fraser's recollections come with a few drawbacks worth noting. For some reason, Fraser felt compelled to explain why he was writing this book. One would think that a book about a famous author's service in Burma would not really require such explanation.  I suppose what he really meant was ""why was he writing it after all those years?"" - the personal history was not published until 1992 and had been written recently from memory and not based on any contemporaneous notes or early draft.Fraser explains that firstly he is recording what may be the ""last great battle in the last great war"". Such an utterance of sodden nonsense is disappointing coming from the author of the Flashman books - that, if anything, establish humanity's ready willingness to blow one another's brains out (See e.g.Flashman and the Redskins). He fears that the battle has been forgotten, but gives a hint of his real motive when he laments the changed ""attitudes to war"". Fraser also notes that he is offering a soldier's view of the Burma campaign rather than the already well-told officer's view.Fraser slips off the rails, however, when he further justifies his book by an attack on Paul Fussell'sWartime: Understanding and Behavior in the Second World War- or rather a review of that book. As becomes clear in reading Fraser's war memoir, he and Fussell experienced war - or recall their war experiences - in profoundly different ways (Fussell wrote Wartime in 1989.). Fussell was severely psychologically damaged by his war experiences (as well as physically wounded). Fussell set out to knock down many of the myths of WW II, the so-called Good War, and Fraser is outraged by such attitudes (not outraged enough to have actually read the book, however). Fraser is intent on preserving as many of the myths as possible (which he denies are myths). More unsettling is Fraser's adamant unwillingness to accept that other soldiers experienced the war in starkly different terms (He flatly states Fussell presents ""a view which is false"".).Fraser's tale focuses on his 8-man 'section' (equivalent to a US squad) of his platoon. He does not use the soldiers' actual names for reasons that are not entirely convincing. Like Flashman, Fraser was working from memory, but unlike Flashy, Fraser does not have an omniscient editor adding historical footnotes and correcting his lapses of memory. Not using real names does not add to the reader's confidence.One final bit of carping: Fraser was clearly offended that views of war had changed, even among soldiers, and just will not let it drop. He cites modern soldiers' confessing fear in battle to the ""disgusting inquisition of war reporters"". In his day, that ""was simply not done."" Perhaps so, at least in his own section, but Fraser should heed his own counsel. He has earlier warned against trying to view WW II experiences through the outlook of today; he should have inferred the corollary that viewing current actions through the outlook of 70 years ago is just as likely to lead to misunderstanding and incomprehension.Nonetheless, as a devoted fan of the Flashman books, I think other devotees will also enjoy the book. Fraser's trademark dexterous use of the language employed by his Cumberland 'marras' (mates) brings the characters vividly to life. He introduces the reader to topics little known but of historical importance (aside from the Burma campaign itself there is the battle of Imphal and Kohima that stopped the 1944 Japanese invasion of India). The writing is crisp and a joy to read. In addition to Fussell's Wartime, I would also suggest that the reader try E.B. Sledge's memoirWith the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa. Readers may also enjoy Fraser's lesser known works of historical fiction based on his later WW II experiences in the Middle East,The Complete McAuslan: All the Hilarious McAuslan Stories in One Volume.",1
"I absolutely loved this book!  I have to admit that I was a little disappointed about book four.  Bringing in so many new characters was a little confusing and not having so many of our favorite characters featured in it, was a disappointment to me.  That being said, book five has more than made up for it and I am eagerly anticipating Book 6!  Get to work, George!!",1
Loved this book!  The author really engaged my interest in the characters.  Such a great story and hurrah for the ending!!,1
Very impressed with this book. I really enjoyed when they went to Peru. This is my 3rd of his books and really enjoyed this.,1
Great book - hoping that they will republish in hardcover.  I have all of these books - all twelve and I was not able to get hardcovers in about four of them - especially the Liveship Traders trilogy.,1
"This is a classic. Funny lines, great rhymes and rhythm, engaging pictures, and an appealing main character. If a parent loves to read it as much as a toddler loves to hear it, that's the sign of a great book.",1
A fantastic read. Better than the TV show by a mile (I read this before watching and still do live the TV show). Full of twists and turns that keep you excited to see what will happen next. Don't get too attached to some of the characters or you may regret it. Buy this now.,1
"If you read only one, perhaps this should be it.  I am not a trained student of Hemingway, or of literature for that matter.  I know what I like, and I can recognize junk.  You don't have to be an expert or even fully understand the author and his times to appreciate what a superb novel this is.  As I was reading it, I could realize why Hemingway was so honored, even during his lifetime.  The story is basic, though the setting is in unsual one for most American readers (who today probably would guess that the ""Spanish Civil War"" has something to do with General Lee and the Alamo).  The main character, Robert Jordan, is an American leftist attached to a guerilla unit in the Spanish mountains.  Like Hemingway, Jordan is intelligent, deliberate, controlled, passionate, and motivated by his ideals.  Through him the reader encounters the chaos of this amateur war that is being played by foreign professionals.  The entire book, which is of some size, revolves around one mission and take places over only a couple of days.  In addition to a political statement and a philosophical autobiography, this is a superb war novel.  The book build up the mission (to destroy a bridge) so much that by the closing pages of the book, as the mission is unfolding, my heart was literally racing and I could not put the book down.  I won't spoil it - but this one ends like so may of EH's books, and like EH thought life itself would end . . . .Great book - don't miss this classic.",1
"After a long delay, I expected much and more, to steal one of Martin's favorite phrases, than I got from the first A Song of Fire and Ice book in over five years. But what I got was like mother's milk, (another favorite,) for those of us who longed for a return to a world we loved and characters that we missed.Longsuffering fans of the series (and I count myself among them,) have been reading this series since the first book A Game of Thrones was published in 1996. The most recent book prior to this one, A Feast for Crows, was published in 2005 and that novel is actually only half of A Dance with Dragons. But not the normal half, where the first portion chronologically is separated into part one and then the second half, or what happens next, is put into part two. A Dance with Dragons is actually like Martin took a loaf of bread and sliced it long-ways, making the whole story only coherent when you shuffle A Dance with Dragons together with A Feast for Crows like a deck of cards. The last full book, meaning all the characters working through a continuous timeline, was published in 2000. That means that for the last 11 years, fans of this series have been waiting for updates on some of these characters. It was not worth the wait.For the last 11 years we've wondered what happened to Daenerys Targaryen, Jon Snow, and others and the answers given in this book were less than satisfactory. In fact, it had been so long, that I had to be reminded who some of these characters were for the story to make sense (and in fact, the excellent HBO production of A Game of Thrones was instrumental in helping me remember.) I see no way that this series can possibly conclude in only two more books because almost nothing happens! How can we read nearly 1000 pages and there be so little movement?Martin has been called the American version of J.R.R. Tolkein. That is most certainly not true! Not just because of the timeliness issues, but rather the fact that there is nearly complete moral ambiguity in these novels. At no time are readers clear about who is right or wrong, who is evil or good, and there is no one to cheer for that actually survives any given book. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings had no such issue. Tolkien made it very clear who were on the side of good and who weren't. He also made clear that individual choices had consequences and actions like courage, loyalty and truth were to be encouraged and greed, lust and dishonesty were to be discouraged. Martin conveys no clear moral compass. And this is a looming failure for this series: will we even care who wins the Iron Throne in the end?The books may seem more like a very, very short ride after a long, long line at an amusement park, but those of us who made the mistake of reading the incredible first three books have no choice but to continue to wait for the series conclusion, frustrated, but hopeful.Roy Dotrice, was a complete failure in the unabridged audiobook version, which is what this review is based upon. From the first chapter I wondered whether I would be able to stomach the gruff, growling voices that made nearly every character - male or female - sound like they were angry Irish dwarves. He was great for the narration, but the voices were a huge distraction. And it may be because the book was 959 pages long, but there were a multitude of uncorrected errors by Dotrice as he would read and realize a moment later that he was doing the wrong voice and switch. Most audiobooks get edited to fix these, so I assume the non-corrections are due to length. Finally, on the audiobook, Martin may not be a good candidate for audio regardless of reader because of his reliance on characters and inner-thought in his narrative, which makes it tough to tell when listening to a reader when the character is thinking and when they are actually speaking.For those of us who have been hooked for years, we had no choice but to devour hungrily - like men starved - this book. But for those of you have not yet started this ride, hold off until or even if Martin finishes this series. Instead look to authors like Brandon Sanderson for excellent fantasy books that actually progress and series that actually end.Review originally published at BookGateway. This book was provided by the publisher as a review copy.",1
"[I received one of the copies of A Dance with Dragons that were accidentally released early.  I've written two reviews.  The first is an informal, completely spoiler-free commentary for fans of the series who want a quick judgment of the book.  The second is a longer, more wide-ranging review, which includes some mild spoilers about various characters' arcs and the structure of the book, as well as comments on theme and tone that may imply larger spoilers.  There will also be spoilers for earlier books.]So.  Is it better than A Feast for Crows?The question is a leading one; it assumes that Feast was a bad or a weak book.  I actually liked Feast quite a lot, both on first reading lo these many years ago, and on rereading it in recent weeks.  Considering what the evolution of the story had made it, I thought it was the best book it could possibly be, and that the author's atmospheric world-building and vivid characters were supplemented by a sense of encroaching doom, the imminence of magic and of winter.But of course I'll concede that for many the book's relaxed pace and style was a disappointment after the ridiculously-eventful A Storm of Swords.  A Dance with Dragons has more surprises and revelations than Feast, but those who absolutely despised that novel will very possibly be frustrated by this one as well, unless what they disliked was the particular characters involved rather than the structure.  The beginning is strong, with a number of developments and answered questions people may not have been expecting, but after that the middle of the book returns to the significant but very gradual plot evolution that characterized Feast.  There are some atmospheric world-building and set pieces that are very effective, but perhaps not worth inclusion in a book that's very long, and focuses on only half the characters to boot. (Some of what seems irrelevant may turn out to be important later, of course.)  The climax, though, ups the ante again, with more sudden and shocking developments, capped by what I think is the best final chapter in the series to date.  The Winds of Winter looks set to return to the constant action and rapid development of A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords, and while some may wish that could have happened at the beginning of Dance rather than near the end, I think there's enough going on in this book to satisfy all but the most disaffected readers.-------------------------------------------------------------------[Mildly spoilerish review begins here.]Here it is.  Nearly six years after the last installment of A Song of Ice and Fire, George R. R. Martin's gritty epic fantasy, the new book, A Dance with Dragons, has arrived.  But in some ways the wait for this book has been even longer, as 2005's A Feast for Crows only featured half of the series' major characters, because the novel grew so much during the writing process that it couldn't be published in its original form.  The author originally hoped to published this companion volume within a year of that book, but the story grew more and other problems intervened.  As a result, A Dance with Dragons marks the first appearance of some of the series' most popular characters in over a decade.Tyrion Lannister, the brilliant but increasingly bitter dwarf son of one of the realm's great houses (Richard III is an obvious general model for the character), has fled the royal seat at King's Landing after murdering his father.  Aimless at first, he is soon set on a new path by an ally of the eunuch spymaster Varys, who had been vital in his escape.  But the journey he faces is long, uncertain, and dangerous, and several dark developments along the way threaten to further his decline into cruelty.Jon Snow is now Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, the organization sworn to guard the massive Wall against incursions from the frozen north.  Jon is determined to make the changes he believes necessary to meet the Watch's purpose in changing times, but he must contend with doubtful subordinates and the presence at the Wall of the rebel king Stannis, who seems determined to test the Watch's commitment to staying out of the politics of the realm.  Caught between the king and the Watch, Jon must walk a narrow path where a single misstep could bring disaster.Daenerys Targaryen, last survivor of the realm's former royal house, is half a world away, trying to rule the city she has conquered.  She has three dragons and a large, well-trained army on her side, but Meereen's customs are alien to her, its people difficult to rule without draconian measures she cannot accept, and the price she must pay for control may prove more than she can bear.  Even the blood of the dragon is not guaranteed easy allegiance.These are the three most prominent characters of A Dance with Dragons, taking up about half its length, but there are many others, including a few returning faces from A Feast for Crows.  The presence of those characters and their storylines gives the novel's climax an added energy it sorely needs, for the middle of the book is, by structural necessity, slow-moving, as various situations gradually approach the breaking point.  This pace may be familiar to certain frustrated readers of A Feast for Crows, who had expected something closer to the relentless action of A Storm of Swords, the third book in the series.  But A Dance with Dragons is undeniably more eventful than A Feast for Crows, and certain character arcs are structured to end in the middle of the book, which means that their resolutions come early and offer a jolt of action to counterpoint those arcs that are still developing.Questions of plot aside, the author's characterization and world-building are as fascinating as ever.  Jon and Daenerys are very young, and unlike many youthful heroes in the fantasy genre, who rule nations or command armies when little more than children and do it perfectly, they have their flaws and failures as well as virtues and successes.  There are no unambiguously good or bad leaders in Martin's world, only characters with different personalities and worldviews who are all determined to manipulate the current chaos to their own benefit.  As rich as the milieu has been in the first four volumes, A Dance with Dragons gives us awe-inspiring new locations, as well as old ones seen in new ways.  The Winds of Winter may be the title of the next volume, but this one gives us a haunting foretaste of what that chill will be like.The world of A Song of Ice and Fire has always been harsher than that of many fantasies, inspired by real history, less romanticized and putting as much emphasis on the cruelties and desolation of medieval warfare as on noble heroism and elegant courtly intrigue.  A Dance with Dragons is no exception, and the evolution of the story in this book is along dark lines, dominated by failures that sow seeds of chaos the next volume seems likely to reap in abundance.  The final chapters mark a return to the unexpected and fast-moving action to which fans have become accustomed, and confirm what many readers have hoped: that a beloved but delay-plagued series is, after a long middle period, finally entering its endgame.",1
"This is not a typical fantasy story, it's a never ending series of well-described events involving perfectly profiled characters in a wonderful setting.It's hard to grasp, you usually forget half of what you read and to be honest it doesn't matter.  You could skip 100 pages and keep on reading as if nothing.It's like life.  Not everything happens for a reason, the sequence of events is unpredictable, follows no moralistic or predictable model and you can either hate it or get used to it.  I decided to be the latter.",1
"Where to even start with a review of this book...  There are over 2,600 reviews already and I doubt I'll be able to add anything new or groundbreaking.  My mom and my friend have been trying to get me to read Water For Elephants for the past couple of years, but I've resisted.  I didn't want to read this book for a few reasons, namely - the subject matter (a traveling circus) didn't really excite me, the idea of an old man telling the story in a sort of flashback manner reminded me too much of The Notebook (of which I only saw the movie), and most of all, I didn't want to read this story because I absolutely adore animals and I knew there would be parts about abuse that would be difficult for me to read.  But now that the movie has come out, I knew it was time to give it a go.  Books are always so much better than movies and I wanted to check this novel off my list before it possibly became tainted by Robert Pattinson's portrayal.... just in case.  :)If, like me, you also have these reservations - don't let them stop you.  Yes, the story is rather sad in parts, and it will make your heart break, but it's so much more.  It took me a while to really get in to the story, but I absolutely tore through the last 200 or so pages.  It's not so much a love story as it is a life story.You can really tell that the author did her homework.  There are vivid, graphic descriptions of everything and you feel like you're right there with these characters.  The true mark of a good writer (at least for me) is when they can create characters that you hate and abhor so much they can actually make your skin crawl even after you've read the last page.  This author did that - and with more than one character.Overall, it was a fantastic story and I highly recommend it!",1
"Like I say about all the books in this series, wonderful, great read and very close to what really goes on in politics around the world.",1
"I can't really say anything that hasn't been said already by the other people who enjoyed this book. There's a reason this book has so many reviews, and it's a good reason. The story sucks you in from the start, and Jankowski remains sharp even when he gets older as evinced by the scenes in present day. Jankowski is a well-made character and the story is as believable as it is engaging. I'd rate this ten stars if I could, but I'm willing to settle for 5 as it's all Amazon will let me do :)",1
"It is not that all of the criticisms in the posted reviews are erroneous, it is just that this installment and the over arching story of the series are utterly amazing notwithstanding the validity of some of those criticisms.  Yes, the storyline is highly complex and has innumerable characters.  Yes, I am concerned that I might die or, more likely, that Martin might die before the whole series is completed.  Yes, the wait for the next installment is likely to be insufferable.  And yes, to a whole host of similar criticims.  SPOILER ALERT But at the end of the day, none of that seems to matter when Daenerys -- after almost 5 full volumes of anticipation -- mounts Drogon and rides him out of the fighting pits.  That scene, and probably another 20 stunning scenes in the book, make me not care an iota about all of the other issues.  This is grand saga storytelling of the highest order.  If Homer were alive, he'd be impressed.",1
"Loved this book since first I read it, years gone by.  Purchased this copy for a friend who has not ever read Gibran.",1
"I was torn between two or three stars. I read this book for my book club, otherwise it is unlikely I would have picked it up considering my backlog.Personally I didn't find anything wow-ish or over the top astounding with this story. Besides that it takes place in a circus. It had its moments of course, which makes me think that what really makes you like a book is not sometimes the overall story, but a couple of scenes that really stand out. And this had a handful of those, especially those set in the present time, which were the only ones to actually pull my emotional strings, which usually doesn't take much I'm afraid, and considering that this book didn't stir much in me overall. Not even the traditional `big twist' scene riled me up. I actually read a paragraph past it then did a double take on `oh that was suppose to be it'.",1
It's hard to complain about a book I got for free. This one is a great read and very interesting. I recommend it.,1
"Water for Elephants is a small step up from chick-lit, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, if it's what you're looking for.  A great read for the beach, or a good light read in-bewteen heavier or darker novels.As mentioned in other reviews, the character development was on the poor side, and the plot was pretty predictable (kind of hokey).  I felt the reading level was quite low, which made it a quick read, but not the brightest one.  Everything was pretty spoon-fed to the reader...there was no need for me to think about anything.  I prefer a bit more of a challenge.",1
"My Grandad got me into Cussler. I'd eagerly wait for him to finish the latest installment, so I could then read it.Now I can buy my own copy and with Sahara, Cussler is as brilliant as ever. Dirk foils a plot to wipe out all sea life, rescues the beautiful Eva Rojas and takes on a bunch of cannibals. It is all delivered with the direct panache of all Cussler novels and even though you know it's all going to end well, its how Dirk achieves it that makes it so much fun. A true thriller.",1
"Someone gave me my first copy of this.  It sat around my house for weeks before I finally picked it up...  and couldn't put it down.  Since then I have purchased copies for everyone I know.  Not a huge fan of the movie, but I have read this book several times which I rarely do unless the book is really special.  This one is a keeper.  BUY IT.  You'll want an elephant of your own  : )",1
"I have just read the first two books of this trilogy. Magnificent and tiring, the books have great vision, but Robinson's reach sometimes exceeds his grasp. The Mars series is a brilliant imagining of a future world that manages to weave future science with contemporary problems in an interesting, ever thought provoking fashion. This compelling world is just about enough to offset Robinson's problems with dialogue, characters, pacing, and description. Despite the hamhandedness in all of the aforementioned, the world is vivid enough and the personalities compelling enough--at least the original, fully fleshed out ones, not their often hastily introduced replacements--that you'll likely be enraptured for quite a while. And while Green Mars sometimes put the sag into saga, there's not a doubt that I will slog through the last book.",1
Patterson is a effective writer- Has the ability to keep you spellbound-  This on keep you wanting to keep on reading to see what happens- Go  for it-,1
"The great film director Jean Renoir tells the story of the life of one of the great masters of modern painting, his father Auguste Pierre Renoir. He does this in an intelligent, perceptive and humane way. He was close to his father , had many long intimate conversations with him, and truly cared for, honored and admired him.The story begins in 1915 when the young Renoir who has been wounded in the leg is released from the Army and returns home. He has too received terrible news which has crushed his father. The mother of the family has died. Returning home he and his father develop a closer relationship than they have had before.Young Renoir traces the history of the family back to the time of his great- grandparents. He tells of the early years of his father , when he worked as craftsman doing portraits on porcelain. He tells of his father's understanding of his art and of the special joy in which he worked and lived.He describes his father's economical and non- romantic approach to Painting. And he also tells the story of how his father continued to paint also to the very last minutes of his life. And how the honors and wealth which came to Renoir in his last years did not effect his fundamental vision or way of working in life.What is apparent through this work is that a loving son truly seeks to understand and represent his father truly- and that one great artist has a capacity for understanding another great one.A wonderful book.",1
"Elizabeth Roffe (a beautiful 20-something woman) becomes owner of a huge corporation when her father Sam dies in an accident (or was it a murder?).  She quickly finds out that someone is trying to ruin the whole corpration and it's up to her to find out who.Despite the length the book reads VERY fast and is never dull.  There's so much happening that keeping track of it all can be confusing but u get up to speed quickly.  The characterizations are paper-thin, the plot has HUGE loopholes and reality totally disappears a few times (especially at the end).  Still I'd be lying if I said I wasn't entertained and kept reading.  This is not a good book at all but it's perfect for the beach or to read when you're in the mood for something trashy and fun.  Be warned--there is plenty of sex and violence mixed together but it's hard to take this seriously.  Very much a guilty pleasure.",1
This book is very well written!  I loved the suspense and the authenticity of the main character. I loved that it presented a view of animals as feeling creatures without being remotely sappy. I love the brutal truth of life during the depression and the realities of aging in America.  I read it in two days and put alls of other things on the back burner.  It is a great book!,1
"My family discovered this book when my younger brother was the age for picture books, and we all loved it.  In fact, we can still quote it by heart.The book is really just a list of things that start with the letter B, but the Berenstains have managed to create a story that's a lot of fun with it.  We follow the results when a bear, a bull, and a baboon blow bubbles and bike backwards.  What happens?  Well, they bump into all kinds of things.  And the more they bump, the more absurd the book gets and the more fun it truly is.As I said, we all loved this book.  It was clever and charming and so out there you can't help but laugh at it.  Each page pretty much repeats what came before while adding a new layer to the chaos.  And the illustrations capture what is happening perfectly.This is a true classic picture book.  If you can find a copy, you're family will love it.",1
"Alistair MacLean - one of the premier adventure storywriters - is at his best when writing first-person narratives that put his protagonists in perilous situations, and then push them to the limits of physical,  emotional, and psychological endurance.  His early novels are exciting,  full of cliff-hanging situations, and rife with clever ""detection"" in the  classical sense:  MacLean plays by the classical detective rules, placing  all of the clues in front of the reader, and - at his most cunning - daring  the reader to figure out who the criminal mastermind is.But the  detection - and the undertones of ""espionage"" - are superficial elements  used to keep the narrative moving briskly along between action set pieces  that pit the protagonist against impossible odds and, very often, against  the severest imaginable environmental extremes.  By these standards, ""The  Golden Rendezvous"" is one of his better books.It is an excellent blend  of mystery, suspense, clever bluffs and double bluffs, self-deprecating  wit, action, and our protagonist's determined efforts to overcome painful  injuries and antagonistic environmental extremes.A luxury cruise ship is  hijacked at sea by a master criminal whose intention is not a simple  ransoming of the wealthy hostages on board.  Exactly what his goal is forms  part of the mystery that is left for our hero - the injured First Officer  of the ship, John Carter - to ferret out.  And to undermine.""The Golden  Rendezvous"" finds MacLean at near-top form.  The book does not have quite  the verve of ""The Satan Bug"", ""The Dark Crusader"", or ""When Eight Bells  Toll"", but it comes close.  Which - at the high level that MacLean delivers  excitement and page-turning suspense - makes for outstanding adventure  story reading.",1
"Although I love these books,#5 is not my favorite -- not enough Ayra & other favorites for me and too many new characters I don't care about.  Also too much fighting detail and not enough dyrewolves! Finally, when will Dany reach the west and have meaningful interactions with hwe",1
"This book is very enjoyable from beginning to end. It starts with a narration in the present and weaves in events from the narrators past. The style is fluid and non pretentious, engaging for its simplicity and character development. This book feels real when it presents its characters and you can't help but get entwined with the sentiments they live. I haven't seen the movie but I'm glad I read the book first. The story revolves around Jakob a retired circus vet which relates how he came to be involved in the circus world of the 30's and all he lived through while the show went on. The story depicts life through the depression, prohibition and society as a fitting background for the storyline.",1
"I have been a student of the Holocaust since before I was a teenager.  A major focus of my interest was the Nuremberg Trials in which the surviving Nazi big wigs were brought to justice in an extensive judicial review of the high crimes of Nazi Germany.  The world was focussed on the trials and an Academy Award-winning feature film was made about them as well.  When I read a review of ""The Other Nurembeg: The Untold Story of the Tokyo War Crimes Trials"", it may have been the first I knew that there actually was such an inquest.  I never came across it at book stores so I sought it out on Amazon.com to find out just what the trials were all about.These trials were somewhat different from their German counterpart.  One difference was the control that General MacArthur held over the creation and (to a small extent) control of the trials.  There were also a lot more countries represented on the Bench.  Instead of the Big Four in Europe, the Americans, English and Chinese were joined by jurists from Australia, the Soviet Union, The Netherlands, The Philipines, India, and France.  The chief judge was an Australian and the chief prosecutor was an American.  The accused, however, were all Japanese.There were a variety of issues involved such as the Rape of Nanking, the forced labor, the surprize attack on Pearl Harbor, the killing of POW's and shooting survivors of torpedoed ships, the mass murders in China, The Philipines and elsewhere.  The issue of waging an agressive war was also an issue which was worked over and defined.The genesis of the tribunal and the prosecution of the trials are spelled out well in Arnold Brackman's researched recollection as a journalist covering the trials at the time.  Some topics and crimes may seem to be covered in less detail that the reader may prefer.  However, Brackman's description of the tens of thousands of pages of evidence and testimony gives us an overall aprreciation of the author's ability to summerize the major points of the trials.  There are a lot of incidents referred to that may have escaped the attention of many readers.  The initial outbreak of the invasion in China was an event known as the Mukden Incident which was news to me.  At times the vollume of brutality left the author acknowledging that there was a lot more than he (or the tribunal) had time to cover.Brackman had a good sense of the personalities and rivalries involved in the judges and lawyers working in the trials.  He also was rather defensive at times regarding that variety of opinions back home about the War and its' causes.  He is also willing to speak frankly about some of the merits of the defense of the accused.  For example, he points out that the Japanes army had ""liberated"" a number of European colonies in Asia.  However, Brackman also points out that the Japanese were more brutal to their Asian captives than they were to the European ones.At times the book seems more oriented to a legal focus rather than an historic one but this is, afterall, about a trial rather than a battle.  In the end, the trial, having lasted well past what was expected, came to an end with seven executions and a number of lengthy prison sentences of which most ended with parole in the mid-1950's.The Tokyo trials were not the focus of the world like their Nuremberg counterpart.  However, they were an important reminder that, even in war there are standards of decency.  The evidence that we do get reminds us of the reason for the trial.  ""The Other Nuremberg"", like the trials themselves, is valuable for the closure that it brings to the end of a brutally waged war of agression.",1
Nouwen is so powerful in his use of words to describe our life journey.  I find this specific book to be extremely useful in presenting the Threshold program I present at several Oregon Department of Corrections.  Higly recommend it for any who are working in the Corrections/Re-entry field,1
Love this book. Have for many years. I couldn't find it used anywhere and I prefer to buy mine used for budget and Eco friendly reasons.,1
"Best book I've read in a while!!! A must read!!! Buy it! Trust me! It's fantastic!!!!! The only disappointment was that I finished it so fast (couldn't put it down), now, what will I read?? ;)",1
"As in most great space stories, this story has a rich background in science and a detailed development of the characters. There are more than just a few characters and relationships to follow to keep it interesting. It is a believable story of the future, almost like an advanced history. The unfolding of the characters and character relationships are a pleasure to read. The story continues to roll along at a good pace without being bogged down with too many extraneous details. For the multiplexer, it is a story that you can break away from periodically and are always glad to pick back up. Red Mars makes you think about the exploration of pristine environments and the politics of changing such environments. I have yet to complete the RED Mars story, but already have plans to read the full trilogy.",1
"This was a very romantic and sweet book.  In the beginning I found Jacob to be very real; moving and sympathetic.  Ahh, but then the circus comes to town and we're back to his youth ...The travails of working in a traveling circus are real and riveting; the details seem accurate.  At times I thought the author lost her voice but for the vast majority of this book, I enjoyed it a great deal!",1
"Just once, I would like this author to finish writing a book.  This story just keeps getting longer and longer.  Don't get me wrong, I like serial books.  I enjoy catching up with my favorite characters in new and exciting novels.  What I don't appreciate is the neverending, cliff-hanger ""endings"" in these books.  It wouldn't be so bad if the next novel was available within a reasonable amount of time, but to wait 2-5 YEARS for a followup book, after leaving so many dangling storylines, is a bit much to ask.  George, this may well be the last of your books that I read.",1
"This book was amazing.  It was very different from the books that I've been reading lately (thrillers, science fiction) and I would recommend it to anyone.  You got to know the characters, even the animals, and ended up feeling as if you were hearing a story about somebody you knew.  She did such a good job, and I hope that her others are just as good!",1
"This book was well written but I have to admit I had difficulty getting through some of the elephant torture passages, in fact I am still cringing thinking of them, (not that some humans didn't face some awful abuse as well in this book)...",1

"Mary Boleyn was the daughter of Thomas Boleyn and the sister of Anne.When she was 12 she was married to Sir William Carey. At 14 she was asked by her family to leave her marriage and become the mistress to the King of England Henry VIII. Over the next several years she had two children by him, a girl Catherine and a boy Henry.Soon after the birth of her son Mary watched as her sister Anne used her charmes to get the king away from her. Mary was forced to watch as Anne went from mistress to wife and mother to Pricess Elizabeth before loosing her head for adultery.While Anne was with the King Mary fell in love with and married a servent to her Uncle Howard and had a daughter by him.While this is not all historically accurate it is well researched and gives the reader a chance to look at what life was like during the reign of Henry VIII",1
Why am I seeing so many reviews that say this book was a disappointment?! I finished this book in one week. I looked forward to picking it up and finding out what happened next. I told my family and friends about it. Read this book and you won't be disappointed. :),1
"I love this one. If you ever wondered about Mr. Clark and where he came from and how he ended up where he did, this really explains it well. You have to really be a die hard clancy fan to understand what this one is about. If you don't know any of the Jack Ryan books, you won't be into this one. This is the beginning of John Clark.",1
"Based on the other reviews I almost didn't read this book. I ended up enjoying it, and the last 500 pages moved quickly. True, nobody really gets to where we as readers want them to, but the setup for book 6 is really interesting. That said, Martin's editor needs to get a bit more aggressive with the delete button and keep inanities such as dragon queen and fearless raider Dany saying one more time &#34;I'm just a young girl and know little...&#34; from creeping into book 6.  I enjoyed this more than book 4, which was a big letdown for me after the intensity of book 3.",1
"Well I think the sign of a good book is when you put it down and you are still thinking about the characters or the storyline because you can't get them out of your head.  That was definitely true of this book!I had heard and read a lot about Water for Elephants which actually put me off reading it as It meant my expectations were sky high and I wasn't sure if the book would be able to live up to them.  But let me tell you that it certainly did.I was a little apprehensive about how it started, with Jacob in his golden years reflecting on his youth, but in the end I found this was actually one of the things I enjoyed about how the book was written.  Like Jacob, I longed for the times when his mind slipped back to his younger years when his body was whole and his mind sharp, when his passions ran high and his life was full of adventure.  I could relate to his frustration with his age, mental status and physically limitations.The story of his life was emotional, and felt very real.  The ending was surprisingly satisfying for the reader and Jacob, possibly because Jacob received what we all hope for at the end of a long life.  I'm not going to say anymore than that, as i dont want to give anything away so if you want to know more you will have to read it yourself.  I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did.",1
"If you like mystical stuff mixed with romance, you might like this book. I enjoyed it, but there were a few things that bothered me.The story is really two stories that are combined.1. Louisa's story takes place in a diary, and is set in the Victorian era, when people traveled to Egypt but still wore corsets and all sorts of formalities were observed. This was by far the best part of the book. It was romantic, and the love story between Louisa and Hassan was very touching.2. Anna's story takes place in the present. Anna is reading Louisa's story in her diary. (Louisa is her great-grandmother). Anna follows in her footsteps to Ancient Egypt to recover from a nasty divorce. When she gets there, weird, mystical stuff starts happening to her because of a scent bottle that she has brought with her. In addition to that, there are two men who are after her affections. And maybe something more. The thing is, I didn't like either of them. They both seemed really unpleasant to me, while Anna just lets them into her life. I couldn't understand why she gave either of them the time of day! One grows nicer, but it seemed out of character for him to do so.Despite that, I did enjoy the book. There were some hair-raising moments that were fun. The setting was delightful. And the Victorian romance made it a worthwhile read.",1
"I first became aware of Kahlil Gibran when I read a poem of his that was on the menu at my favorite Lebanese restaurant. Ever since then, I have sought out his books.  The Prophet is my favorite.  Several of the  &quot;poems&quot; or passages are fully relevant to parts of my life.  The  book makes one feel good and inspired to do good for others.  There is  barely an aspect on life that the poems do not touch on-love, marriage,  death and all of our own insecurities and doubts about people and life.  This would be a good book to give to a friend who is going through a rough  time, or just has unanswered questions at a certain point in their lives.  The writing is lucid, insightful, and will be relevant for as long as time  goes on.The drawings add to an already great work.  At my favorite Lebanese  restaurant, I not only found good food-I thankfully found Kahlil Gibran.",1
"I just spent the last fifteen minutes looking at the reviews ~~ and it's very interesting to read all the comments as well. There are so many varied responses to this book that the author must be in heaven to get so many responses to this book.I first heard of this book last spring when a fellow Amazon reviewer told me that I ""just had to read it."" I wasn't that inclined since the price was not favorable and the waiting list at the library was too long. However, in my book club, it was the November book to discuss. So when I saw it on the table at the local bookstore for buy three, get one free, I snapped it up. It is not a decision that I have regretted. It is one of the better entertaining books of fiction that I have read this year, if not one of the best. And I read a lot.There are some disaparities in this book as with others, but I think people tend to forget that a work of fiction is simply that, a work of fiction. Not everything's going to ""mesh together"" as in real life. That's why you read nonfiction if you like everything in its proper place and order. This book is simply a fanastic tale of a man facing the end of his life in a dreary nursing home setting, and reliving some of the best moments of his life. A young orphan who happened to jump the train to get away from the tragedy that was his life happened to be on a circus train. He didn't plan to run away to the circus, he just stumbled on the circus train while grieving. And stayed. Fell in love with the most beautiful girl in the world who is happened to be married to the ringmaster. What a story!This novel alternates between Jacob's present and past ~~ he relives the first three months of being in Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. Jacob is 90 or 93 (he can't remember which) and seventy years prior, he was the Benzini Brothers' vet, taking care of the underfed animals of that show. He worked with all kinds of people and animals. It was an exciting life ~~ how many people do you know that lived a life like that? Marlena is the wife of the psychotic ringmaster who alternately abused his wife, his animals and co-workers. Rosie is the elephant bull that Uncle Al, the owner of the circus, bought for a song, hoping that Rosie will be the biggest draw to his circus.The descriptions in this novel are lavish. One can see the sawdust in the air as the big top was put up. One can see the cotton candy being spun. One can feel the humiliation of an old man having to take a shower under the watchful eye of the nurse in the nursing home. One can feel his love for the beautiful show girl. And all of this is tied together beautifully, both past and present. It is a glimpse into a life of a man.Why didn't I give it a five star? Simply because I felt that the endings to both stories were rushed. I did not expect it to have such happy endings since the stories were more gritty and realistic. But hey, this is a work of fiction, right?11-4-07",1
"I could not put it down, and I found myself reading long after I should have gone to bed because I had to know what was going to happen next!! Wonderful story, and a great ending. Quick read.",1
It had too many other groups of people I had no interest in.  All the characters I am interested in have been killed and now it looks as if Jon Snow has been attacked and killed.  What next? Doing away with Arya & Sensa?,1
"This is the best book I have read in a long time. It gives a great historical account of the early years of WWII that is completely factual, save for the fictional characters Wouk inserts. This book is a page-turner, yet still allows the reader to gain excellent information about real events and circumstances in the war. Wouk shapes his characters so fully that it makes it easy for the reader to empathize with them, yet without any unnecessary detail. I feel this book is a great compromise for people who are interested in world events yet still enjoy a riveting fictional story.",1
"As with all his other books, it is a well written fantasy novel with the perspective of several characters during the same time period. The characters are all very unique, and if you know the series, you will know all these characters already (John, Danny etc.). The whole series is gripping, though not really recommended for the romantic fantasy novel reader as it really doesn't have a thorough ground in that, though does satisfy with the spit-fire romances that usually end in death or betrayal.",1
As some have already started this book I a lot of filler.  That however does not make it a bad read.  It's still enjoyable but in the end the cliff hanger leave you dying for more.,1
"I don't normally read books based in this era, but I found it to be very interesting and it was hard to put down.  This was my first E-book downloaded onto my Kindle and it was great!  I especially liked the pictures of the circus that Sara Gruen included in her book.  It was very easy to picture the characters while reading.  Well done!  Now I may rent the movie to get another perspective.",1
"Harry Flashman is the quinticential anti-hero: a liar, cheat, adulterer, poltroon, theif and braggart.  He is also seen as the very model of Victorian virtue.  And therein lies the appeal and delicious duplicity that has made the Flashman papers so popular.  We, the reader, are in on the joke.In _Flashman_, the template is set for Fraser's other Flashman novels: Flash's unceremonious expulsion from public school, his ""shotgun wedding,"" and the wildly undeserved accolades for bravery and gallantry while Flashy engages in every manner of dubious and lecherous behaviour.For fans of historical fiction, military history or slightly off-colour humor, I highly recommend it.",1
"This book is very touching and entertaining. I was reluctant to read this but once I started, I just can't put it down. If you like to know about what it is like behind the circus' life, being old and left alone..pick this one. You will understand more how to deal with old people and what its in their mind... I have no doubt I will re read this book again in the future",1
"I could not help but notice that reading Sarah Gruen's Water For Elephants is very much like watching the movie ""Titanic.""  First and foremost, each offers big historic pageantry, with a rousing ""you are there"" quality.  Each features two parallel narratives from the same protagonist, one in advanced age, one in a defining passage in young adulthood.  Both feature a romantic triangle involving a young woman who is a victim of her times stuck in a marriage or engagement to a cruel powerful man and the young man of no means who becomes her soulmate and savior.  Both send the young man to a fancy dress dinner in a borrowed tux. Both create insular worlds that are set apart from the rest of the earth, one by an ocean, the other by the train-bound peripatetic exotica of circus life, and within that insular world there is a class structure inspiring social commentary.  Both the Titanic creators and Gruen took admirable artistic risks in going to material that nobody else was treating and both did their homework on historical detail.Water For Elephants is about circus life in the early years of the Great Depression.  It successfully captures glimpses of the American experience and opens up the closed world of the circus that is at once a very dangerous place and a warm sanctuary.  Gruen does not spare the gritty reality of disregard for human and animal life.  She succeeds in creating a very delicately balanced community that can slide into disaster if shoved off balance.  Thinking on the living conditions she portrays, sometimes you have to ask, why would anyone stick with this mess?  For the narrator, Jacob Jankowski, it is love for animals, friends and the aforementioned girl.Water For Elephants is, like the Titanic, a large scale entertainment but when it comes down to it, there is no one line or character that is surprising (except perhaps for the elephant).  The book is well crafted but not artistic.  It may have been very different in the hands of John Steinbeck or EL Doctorow.  That said, Gruen gets points for following through on her inspiration and delivering a book that is very atmospheric and historically interesting, with some social commentary mixed in.This edition comes with a worthwhile interview with Gruen and a book club discussion guide that is more like a junior high English class test.",1
What's not to love about a story by this legendary author. It keeps the reader glued to the story. It adds to the large number of Christie works.,1
"The down load to my Kindle was so simple and I still have it so I can refer to it anytime. I loved the book but now of course like everyone else I have to wait for the next one! Torture!!!! Anyway Amazon has become my go to book buying for hardbacks, paper or Kindle versions their ""1 Click"" option is the best option EVER!! Merry K.",1

"THESE TRILOGY IS THE BEST THING THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED TO ME!!!! FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE GLOOMY AND UNJUST, BUT THEN IT BECAME BETTER AND BETTER AND SUDDENLY I WASN'T ABLE TO PUT IT DOWN, AND THE BEST THING WAS THAT I DIDN'T EXPECT MUCH FROM THESE BOOKS, SO I GOT MUCH MORE THAN I HAD BARGAINED FOR. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE TRILOGY, SPECIALLY TO PEOPLE WHO ENJOY READING SEAFARING AND NAUTICAL ADEVNTURES.",1
I liked all the books in this series. The characters are engaging and the writing is great. I'm looking forward to the next book.,1
"I found that James Patterson's #1 book &#34;Along Came a Spider&#34; is a very interesting read.  It it not too often that I can find a psychological mystery to be this exceptional.  The Gary Soneji/Murphy out smarting the police with being a psychopath, potential Multiple personality disorder/ personality fatigue, and being the actor with having homicidal &#34;1 year/5 year/lifetime plans&#34; to be famous like he feels he should be is very interesting.  From what I heard (without reading any other Alex cross books), this book will set up for some storylines in the next few books allowing for some interesting storylines for the book now.This book series is the Law and Order: Criminal Intent series of James Patterson.  While the story revolves around the crime and solving the crime, there is a huge element to the psychological, motives and the &#34;criminal intent&#34;.  It involves the &#34;ticking&#34; of the criminal to why they would do the things they would do.  It can range from money to famous to just being a pure psychological evil driven madman.  All in all an A+.In this book by itself, there is one drawback.  It can be really slow sometimes.  After Soneji's trial and conviction (about half way through) starting with part 4, it starts dragging while Alex Cross continues the case.  But it does lead up to a very interesting ending (the last few chapters), in which I will be willing to give it a pass.Like I said, an A+ and an A+ book!!!",1
"It began as an inquiry into the character of Celia Ravenscroft, someonethat Mrs. Ariadne Oliver is godmother to, but has not seen since she wasa child.  The inquiry also brings about the murder of her parents.  Didher parents kill one another?  With the help of her good friend, HerculePoirot, Ariadne seeks to find out.  Worth a read.",1
"English literature began with a Viking story, ""Beowulf,"" but have you ever tried reading it? My own ""Beowulf"" experience led me to believe Viking literature is right down there with Viking cuisine in terms of digestibility. Imagine my surprise when I discovered a novel about Vikings, written over half a century ago, to be as thrilling, fantastic, and engaging as ""The Long Ships.""It's the story of Orm, a farmer's son in southern Sweden in the late 900s who one day finds himself a prisoner of a merry gang of Vikings. They quickly adopt him, and set out for adventures off the northern and southern coasts of Europe. Before the book is half over, Orm has found himself in courts from Spain to England, espoused three different religions, slain several dozen foemen, and found a princess to be his bride.Frans G. Bengtsson's novel, originally published in Sweden in 1945, showcases two things I didn't expect from a Scandinavian academic, brevity and humor. Sure, the book is nearly 500 pages long, but Bengtsson crams a lot of incident in every page, describing events in broad strokes and letting the reader's imagination do the rest. Bengtsson's style, preserved marvelously by Michael Meyer's 1954 translation, is to consciously evoke the elliptical prose of ancient Viking sagas, but in such a way as to allow for a modern, tongue-in-cheek sensibility to come through, one that reflects a Viking world, however hard-bitten, of great wit and depth.""The Long Ships"" is marvelously quotable: ""For no man complains of the weight of the cargo, when it is his own booty that is putting strain upon the oars."" Or: ""Only poets can win wealth with empty hands, but then they must make better songs than other poets, and competition spoils the pleasure of composition.""The book jacket includes an enthusiastic reviewer describing ""man-size helpings of battle and murder, robbery and rape,"" which captures some of the tone of ""Long Ships"" but misses most of the point. Orm is no savage bandit, but a thoughtful, evolving character of great honor. The Vikings he travels with do some robbing and killing, but in a measured way. As the novel goes on, a sense of social responsibility, manifested in Orm by his adoption of a somewhat twisted form of Christianity, comes through.You might say the story of Orm is the story of the Christianizing of Scandinavia, told from a rather neutral viewpoint that respects Christianity's mellowing influence without being blind to its flaws in practice. You might also call it a straight-up adventure yarn of many threads. After a battle, Orm and his comrades may retire to a feasting hall to hear stories of brave deeds that fill pages and then never come up again. Or else we might get stories like that of a pair of jesters, forced to entertain the slayer of the king they loved, who come up with a marvelous form of vengeance right out of Monty Python.One thing you can't call ""The Long Ships"" is dull. Even when Orm is not actually at sea (he actually spends a good deal of time raising a family on a farm), the book stays busy. Some old enemy is trying to take his head off, or else he is having another marvelously circuitous exchange with his dyspeptic priest friend, Father Willibald.And the voyages Orm takes are a lot of fun, encompassing as they do the whole of the known world at that time, from Ireland to the Dnieper River and many points in-between. While a work of fiction, Bengtsson finds ways of introducing a lot of relevant Dark Ages history, even if some of it, like an enjoyably arch Y1K scare, may not be 100% accurate.Other books are fun to read. ""The Long Ships"" is a book to get lost in. You will feel like a teenager again as you take the long way home with Orm, enjoying his simpler yet wondrous time and wishing the world could have stayed so forever.",1
"Although I love the series, I have to say that A Dance with Dragons was a well written story with a major content problem. To be fair, the book had some highs, and I was thinking ""YES! Finally the story is getting good"" but then I was massively disappointed. The book has a confusing and unpleasantly startling conclusion that leaves me wanting more but dreading the end of the story! I still am in love with the series and I think Martin is a brilliant writer.... but I just need to have faith that he will finish the story with the same awe inspiring brilliance that he started it with.",1
"An interesting historical novel set in the context of Revolutionary Spain, but classic Hemmingway, it carries with it the important lesson of activism over apathy, especially pertinent to today's world.  It teaches that ideals transcend political boundaries and that if you believe in something strongly, then you owe it to yourself to protect that ideal in any part of the world and at any cost, even that of your life.  Intwined is a beautiful love story.  One of my top 5 greatest books of all time.  Thats a rave, baby.  The poem by John Donne at the beginning makes the book worth buying.A 5 because it is a great story with an invaluable lesson.  If you gain nothing, you still read beautiful prose by one of the greatest authors ever.",1
"The first thing you need to know about this book is that it is a work of fiction! If you want to read a biography of members of English monarchy, then strolling through the fiction shelf is a bad idea. A lot of people are casting doubts on the accuracy of events in this book. It's not meant to be accurate, it is fiction. A lot of people had the same reaction to The Da Vinci Code, another brilliant book. That was not meant to be an accurate account of the Catholic Church and this particular book is not meant to be one of the Boleyns. To accuse ""historical fiction"" of inaccuracy is such an obvious oxymoron that well, strange that people do it!The plot: It is absolutely brilliant; starts and ends on the gravest notes possible. We begin our journey through 16th century England right at the execution block and end it there. The story is woven to delight any reader and it is the kind of plot which makes you reach out for the book every time you put it down.The characters: I must say, I have been utterly blown away by the character development. Who cares if the original people involved were any different, if Anne was any less of a plotter than she is portrayed to be in this book? The characters stick with you and your first instinct upon ending the book is to go online and look for The Boleyn Inheritance to see what became of the survivors.Writing style: The writing style is, if anything, immaculately compatible with historical fiction. I have to say this book defines the genre and as you can probably see, it has over 800 reviews with a stunning average. The writing has stayed in my head while I was reading the book and I literally had to force myself to put it down before going to bed.All in all, this book was an absolute pleasure to read and for those of you wondering whether you should take the plunge into historical fiction, it's the ideal platform to start.",1
"Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre have managed to capture one of the most important years (1947) of world history in their book.  Freedom at Midnight is possibly  one of the most outrageously enthralling works of writing based on real events that I have ever read.This book is an account of the year 1947 in context to the freedom of India from the British Raj.  It opens on New Year's Day, 1947, London and takes the reader on a journey of significant events that lead to the independence of India.  On the way, the reader is introduced to many brilliant characters who shaped up the history in that part of the world and have since left their mark that is still evident.  The decisions made by these people defined the future of millions of people.Freedom at Midnight is an intimate account of the reasoning of these historical figures that lead to the independence and division of India.  Why did Prime Minister Clement Atlee who took office dedicated to break the Empire apart choose Louis Mountbatten, a member of the royal family to be the last viceroy of India?  Why was he the man to administer India's freedom operation?This book is one of the most intimate accounts of the most venerated figures in the world's history, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi aka Mahatma Gandhi.  His approach, position, attitude towards the British Raj, the Indian Congress, the political and social blueprint that he dreamed of the Independent India.  And vice-versa.  As the book flows like an epic, it gives detailed account of final days of Gandhi and who, why and how of the assassination of this revered leader.  The reader is also introduced to Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel and Mohammad Ali Jinnah.What happened to the Maharajas, the palaces, the tigers, the jewels and the harems?  What lead to the demise of fantastic royalty in India?  The authors have devoted a whole chapter to recounting the opulence enjoyed by the Maharajas and their magnificent indulgences.How was the line drawn that divided the nation?  Who initiated the idea and why was the idea initiated?  Collins and Lapierre show poignant picture of the greatest migration in history.  The religious division left an estimated 250,000-500,000 people dead.One of the unsolved matter since than that still afflicts both nations (India and Pakistan) and have since lead to three wars, Kashmir, is devoted a whole chapter.  The valley that was once described as ""heaven on earth"" by the last Mogul Emperor of India today is contradicting the emperor's statement in every way possible.  This book discloses the history behind the conflict.One of the most appealing qualities in the writing of the authors was their effort into giving some personal accounts into the lives of the common people.  I recommend this book to anyone who is a student of world history and precisely history of India.  This book takes the reader through the year that lead to the birth of three nations, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.",1
"A thrill ride of bad luck, stupidity, good luck and more serendipity.  Great fun (especially the part with the painter, it's near the end), but a little on the un side of believable.",1
"WATER FOR ELEPHANTS gives the reader an insight to the innards of the early circuses,  It is well written.  I preferred the movie.",1
"Sure it may not be as exciting as the first three, but the book is still excellent and necessary to the proper continuation of the story.  I do not really know where all of the rage surrounding this and the fourth book come from, but I think a lot of it comes from the time that people have had to wait on them and the expectations that they built up.  Rather than getting any resolution, this book ultimately leaves you with more waiting.  I am fine with that, but I can see why others are not I guess.",1
"Through a twist of events, Jack Ryan is thrust into the presidency.  Not at all sure he wants this tremendous responsibility, or the politics that goes with it, he doesn't even get the luxury of a &quot;honeymoon  period&quot; before he must face a horrible breakout of Ebola.  As always,  life is one catastrophe after another, and Jack performs admirably.  This  is a great book, rivaling his earlier Red Storm Rising for excitement.  Of  course it screams for a sequel, which has been a l-o-n-g time coming.  The  Bear and the Dragon will be released in August 2000...I've already  pre-ordered it!",1
This was the first book I ever read by Robin Hobb and I soaked it up like a sponge! Hobb creates a magical world that is entrancing. Don't just buy the first book. You will be itching to continue reading the trilogy once you are done this one!,1
"This is my first exposure to Ernest Hemingway and, after reading it, I wonder how I could go through eight years of high school and college and not read one Hemingway book.  I loved this book!  I have never taken so quickly to a piece of classic literature.  Hemingway's style is powerful, evocative, and dramatic.  And yet none of the prose is overly verbose or bombastic.  This tale, set over four days in the mountains of Spain during the Spanish Civil War, follows Robert Jordan, an American fighting in the International Brigade, and his preparations for a bridge demolition.  During that time, he falls in love with the beautiful and tragic Maria as well as befriends the group of guerrillas he is working with.  During those four days, Jordan loves, idealizes, and submits to his dutiful fate more passionately than most men ever will.  If you have never read Hemingway before, I suggest you do so right away.  This book is a great one to start with and I know that I will be looking to read more of his works soon.",1
"I enjoyed this book so much.  So much, in fact, I was sad when it was over.  Definitely worth the money.",1
Barbara Erskine has a PhD in Scottish history. You can look up all the historical details that she weaves into her stories and find them as being true. if you don't like the genre of books - a bit of fantasy is mixed with proven historical facts - then this book is not for you. If you like to learn about history by ways of a fantasy novel - you can't find anything better! One of my favorite books! And by the way: I read all of Barbara Erskine's books.,1
"The air of competition and ambition that made up Mary Boleyn's life is not often the story that you hear when speaking of the Boleyns and life at the English court.  Philippa Gregory weaves an almost fantastical tale of ambition, pride, and greed and two girls who were sacrificed at the alter of their family's desire for power.  The relationship between Anne Boleyn, her sister Mary (the Other Boleyn Girl), and their brother George is at the forefront of this nearly 700-page novel.  We follow the family for 15 years on their quest for the throne.  Along the way there is marriage, murder, death, disgrace, and everything else you could imagine in a country guided by the whims of its aristocracy.The Other Boleyn girl is the first piece of historical fiction of its kind that I've read and I was impressed with it, if a little surprised.  Gregory takes some liberties with the past, though in her author's note she substantiates them and cites references, which is helpful. In its efforts to depict the day-to-day life of a court more than 400 years old, Gregory has given us a story of a family so blinded by ambition that it tore itself apart.  I found The Other Boleyn Girl an engaging true tale of the pitfalls of greed and when I'm in the mood for another 600-page novel, I'll definitely pick up another of Gregory's books.",1
"This is a great read for those interested in the history of the Third World.  India and Pakistan are countries with huge populations and their independence in 1947 was one of turning points in the decolonization of the Third World.  Collins and Lapierre detail this story in this book.  Also detailed are the four people most important in the independence:  Montbatten, Gandhi, Nehru, and Jinnah.  Millions may have lost their life in the Punjab, but it would have been a far bloodier story if these people were not around.  Focus is given on Gandhi who was a most unselfish person, in recognizing the rights of all faiths.  The book details how Gandhi's struggles lead to the independence of India, and how the leaders of the different faiths broke the country up into Pakistan and India.  The last part of the book is the story of the assassination of Gandhi by Hindu fanatics.This is a great read.  At a little over 500 pages, this book will take some time to digest, but it is one of the best books about the independence struggle of Pakistan and India.  This book also sheds some light on the current problems with Kashmir.A great read.",1

"""Flashman: From the Flashman Papers 1839 - 1842"" is fun book, suitable for  the beach or a long trip, with first rate action writing. My favorite  section shows how Flashman, following his instinct for selfishness and  self-preservation, became the sole English survivor, as well as the hero,  at doomed Fort Piper in the assault on Jallalabad (pages 183-215 in the  Plume edition). I was also moved by the descriptions of the poorly lead  British army in its suicidal withdrawal from Kabul (161-183). One  complaint: In this first ""Flashman"" book, Flashy's lechery begins as  amusing, but eventually turns dark and disturbing.",1
"this book is a drunkolgue. of course, it's very well written. the style, is a style of a superb journalist. but the characters' alcoholism is piercing. the choices they make are hardly romantic, rather they are tragic. the emptiness of the spirit hidden behind the spirit of alcohol pierces through. how so many mice and men have fashioned their lives after this novel puzzles me.",1
"What a character is Colonel Harry Paget Flashman! Winner of the Victoria Cross; the Congressional Medal of Honor and a veteran of wars fought in Africa, India, China, the Malay Peninsula, Madagascar and other locales.  Handsome Flashman is over six feet tall and is a swashbuckling ladies man! All women: old, young, short,tall, slim and fat easily fall prey to his seductive charms!Flashman was a character in Thomas Hughes' ""Tom Brown's Schooldays""who was expelled by Dr. Thomas Arnold of Rugby. Charles Macdonald Frazer takes Flashman and uses him in his long series of novels on this complex rogue.""Flashman and the Redskins"" is a novel divided into two parts:Part One: Flashman is back in the United States fleeing a murder charge. In New Orleans he is reacquainted with the old seadog nemesis the infamous Captain John Charity Spring. Flashy is forced to flee New Orleans before the law and his enemies catch up with him. He escapes with a bordello of black prostitutes under the leadership of the busty madam who hides Flashy. On their way West the girls and Flashy have to deal with maurading Indians. Flashy has sex with one of the prostitutes. In part two he will learn that as a result of this union he has a son who has grown up as a Sioux Indian. Flashy is captured by the Indians; is forced into a marriage with the Chief's daughter and after six months escapes across the blazing sands. He is rescued by Kit Carson.Part II: It is 1875-76. Flashman returns to America with his lovely but dumb wife Elspeth. The Flashmans attend the wedding of General Phil Sheridan in Chicago. Flashman pleads with President US Grant to allow General George Armstrong Custer to return to leadership of the 7th Cavalry. Grant concedes to Flashy's request. Adventures abound as Flashy takes part in the Battle of Little Big Horn being rescued by his Indian son.All of the Flashman novels are narrated in the first person by the elderly Flashman who is supposedly writing his memoirs.The books are well written with incredible detail on the lives of the American Indians and what life was like in Victorian America. The sex scenes are short and handled with taste. Fraser's books are always a delight! Everytime I peruse one I thhik that this novel is the best in the series! Once you read one Flashman novel you will wish to read them all! Excellent!",1
Cat Among The Pigeons is a Classic Hercule Poirot Mystery. Every home library should have this collection.  Books that make you think.....,1
"While I don't completely regret reading this book about a young man who joins the circus as a vet in the 1930's, in hindsight I defintely would have chosen another book. It starts off with a bang, then slows down significantly in the middle, and it ends quite nicely. It's your typical boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl story. I did enjoy the historical fiction aspect of it and I truly enjoyed the final portion of the book where the author writes about why, how, and what she did to write this book.I'd recommend it to the causal reader, but a more sophisticated reader may want to look elsewhere.",1
"The three books in Kim Stanley Robinson's &quot;Mars Trilogy&quot; are my absolute all-time-favorites. He is truly gifted at writing about advanced science and technology and equally adept at creating &quot;real&quot; characters, because he understands psychology. This is a rare talent: to be scientifically knowledgable and a master at creating believable characters. The books are part action, part scientific explanation (like Michael Crichton of Jurassic Park fame), and part character development.In &quot;Red Mars&quot; (the first in the series) Robinson paints a totally believable picture of what our future might be like as we get ready to explore and colonize Mars. Mega-corporations, earthly power struggles, and the selection process for determining who might get to be the first to go to Mars, are all very possible and Robinson crafts a story around these topics with ease.In the second book, &quot;Green Mars,&quot; Robinson portrays the struggle to get vegetation growing and to create a breathable atmosphere. He also describes more political struggles between those on Earth and those on Mars. This was probably my favorite of the three, but mainly because I am more interested in the science that would be needed in this phase of colonization.In the third book, &quot;Blue Mars,&quot; the planet become more Earth-like. The atmosphere is more developed, water travel becomes possible, and more. (I don't want to give it all away!)The books can be kind of scholarly at times, but I was so impressed with these books that I gave them to my teenage brother. He was so impressed with them, that he gave them to one of his very best pals. And we all had a blast discussing them together. If there is a teenage male in your life -- or if you love sci-fi and have always wondered what it might be like to go to Mars -- then this trilogy is definitely for you. Very highly recommended!",1
"Not a fan of reading plays.  For me, too difficult to read.  But I do like Oscar Wilde's works as watched either on the stage or screen.",1
"Water For Elephants is one of the best books I have read this year. Initially, I did not have any interest in reading this book because it involved a circus and I am not a huge fan of circuses. But at the insistence of some friends, I picked it up and began reading. Boy am I glad I did!Jacob Jankowski is a young man who is thrust mercilessly into the aftermath of the cruelties of life. Despite his circumstances, however, he is a good and honorable man and his compassion and honor shine through on every page of this book. He is a character that reader's immediately fall in love with and can relate to on some level or another. The story itself grabs you instantly and takes you back to a time where traveling circuses were the biggest events in town.Set in the 1930's, Water For Elephants offers a glimpse into a very strange and wonderous world of circus folk during a time when many, if not most, of the country was unemployed and doing anything they could to earn a buck or at least a meal. It was fascinating to read of the lifestyle of the circus workers and how they were treated, how they related to one another, how they treated their animals and what they thought of the townspeople they traveled the country to entertain.Water For Elephants is also a story that tells of the love and life of Jacob and Merlena and their love for the animals that they come to know while working with them in the circus. The book is beautifully and vividly written, the characters well developed and easy to love (or hate as the case may be) and the animals' antics, especially Rosie, will make you laugh out loud.Water For Elephants is a wonderful read and I highly recommend it!",1
This book had me hooked from the first chapter.  It's a great saga of the circus life. It was an easy read and had a story line that kept me entertained.,1
"Like watching an Olympic athlete or listening to an accomplished singer reading Khalil Gibran is in many ways indescribeable.In that way, it's good that many of the other reviewers have tried to describe this book by giving anectodes of how it personally touched them.  But ultimately those anectodes are like the stories of people who've gone to some great vacation spot.Sure, they can tell you how they felt enjoying its weather or appreciating its beauty but such descriptions will never compare to you taking your own personal journey there.Because of the way this book is written, some of its passages will no doubt touch you more than others but it is beyond doubt that you will emerge touched and having that rare feeling of connecting with someone only through the medium of the printed word.I wish we could award more than five stars.  I wish it could be an infinity...for every heart touched by this wonderful, wonderful book.",1
"What _Red Mars_ attempts is monumental: Robinson examines humankind in work, in love, in politics, spirituality, reasoning, madness, life, and death, and attempts to chart a course for what we can become. The backdrop of Martian colonization is well-researched and intriguing in itself, and so are the science and theory that enables much of the book's social and political change. And -- lest my weighty words decive you -- this book is *fun*. A few sections drag, but there was no question that I had to find out how it would all end.The story's great flaw is that it does take place on Red Mars. Robinson lets loose a hundred brilliant, uninhibited neophiles and gives them the resources of a small nation to toy with. Many times during this book I felt like he was gratifying a high-schooler's wish for a magic wand that would let the dorks, poets, and science-fiction fans run the world. His ideas about changing humanity are still quite valid! I just wish they were realized in a setting more like the one we have to work with today.I also found Robinson's lavish, technical descriptions of Martian geology to be painful. They're well-written and doubtless scientifically interesting, but he just couldn't make me care. As  a research psychologist, I also have to express that //my profession and I completley and totally disown Michel Duval//, for reasons that should become clear.Despite this, I give _Red Mars_ my hearty recommendation, and think it should be part of the universal science-fiction canon. This is because it's followed by _Green Mars_ and _Blue Mars_, which improve on _Red_ in every way. The writing improves; the characters feel more like our family; and the environment gets more and more like the mess we non-elite earthlings are faced with in real life. If you're with me in wanting to see the world become kinder, smarter, and less self-destructive, these are some ideas you should have in your head.",1
"Very well written and and very grabbing. There were, however, 2 raunchy parts that were a little graphic, especially since they didn't really effect the whole story much. These moments felt as if they were elaborated on specifically in to draw in a larger audience via random moments of smut. For me, it cheapened an otherwise 5 star book. Really now, that was an image of a cartoon character that I did not want inside my head!LIke I said. Beautifully written--but I would have preferred if the aforementioned parts were briefly stated so you knew they happened and then moved on [like the rape scenes in Khaled Hosseini's book (Kite runner, or even the marital scenes in 1000 splendid suns) ].",1
"I like that it is a true story. It has strong and well-developed characters. If you liked the movie, you will like the book. Movie is truer to the book than many, but the book has more detail, as expected.",1
"Reading this made my mind feel like a still pool of water, cool and quiet in a mossy grotto.  It's direct and simple wisdom has a depth of complexity that takes a quiet day to sink in, leaving you at peace.  It is best to set time aside for it, relax, absorb, and let it softly clear your mind.",1
"Great book. Could not put it down once I started reading it. After I finished it, my husband read it and enjoyed it as much as I did.",1
"This was the first fantasy novel that I read and still the best by far in terms of originality, sensitivity towards the subject matter, and all-round  writing talent. My fears were that it would be like all the 'traditional'  fantasy that graces children's movies - goblins, magicians, magic frogs,  etc. - but I gave it a go and was swept into Ms. Hobb's vividly  conceptualised world that contained no goblins, no magicians and, believe  it or not, no magic frogs whatsoever.Hobb sets The Liveship Traders  series in a land far to the south of the Six Duchies that were featured in  her earlier Farseer series (which I also wholeheartedly recommend). It  principally (but not exclusively) concerns Bingtown, a trader port that is  part of the Satrapy of a corrupt and negligent Jamaillia, and Divvytown, an  outlaw community in the Pirate Isles. The attention to realism was the  first thing that grabbed me about Hobb's style; far from being an Emerald  City in a Forgotten Forest, we have essentially a colony reminiscent of  pre-Revolutionary America, pinned between aggressive foreign governments  and an uncaring ruler, plagued by pirates, and struggling for credence and  independence in a land far removed from their pre-colonial roots. Bingtown  itself is very well thought out, a town where the Old Traders with their  Bingtown traditions are being usurped by the New Traders who have bought  their way into society from the dishonest Satrap. Indeed, the resistance to  change of the Old Traders is highly reminiscent of the upper-crust British  aristocracy of the late nineteenth century, social graces of as much  importance as power and money, but infused with the aforementioned desire  for autonomy.The story line is contentious and moving and action-packed  all at the same time, enough there to keep a mainstream action fan happy  and even, perhaps, a Jane Austen enthusiast. Despite its fantastical  setting, it deals with strong contemporary issues such as domineering  parents Hell-bent upon control, the position of women in society,  Government corruption, nepotism, and many more, and still has time for a  few moral debates on the concept of slavery and the ethics of fair trade.  Add to this an array of intelligent sea serpents questing after lost  memory, pirates banding together in an attempt to form a Pirate Kingdom for  outcasts and outlaws, and the night-time appearances of the mysterious Rain  Wild folk, kinsmen of the Bingtown Traders, and it is certainly a novel  which sticks in your memory long after you have finished reading it.It  is in the characters, however, where Hobb truly shines. She is surely in  touch with both her masculine and feminine sides, because every single  character is incredibly empathetically drawn. She has the power to put a  feeling down on paper in such a way that you can feel it too. I was angry  and bitter when main character Althea was cheated out of her heritage, I  felt hurt and lost and slightly upset when Wintrow was coerced into obeying  his father; I have known grown men who admit to crying at things Hobb has  written, and that's something that can't be faked. You finish the novel  knowing her characters, and even the 'baddies' like Kennit and Etta are  painted in such a way that right and wrong becomes ambiguous. You  understand them, and feel for them, and Hobb's talent for this is  exceptional.Overall, Ship of Magic is perhaps the best introduction into  fantasy writing, even if it does overshadow every other fantasy novel you  will read. This is epic writing on a grandiose scale, literary and  heart-rending, intellectual and energetic. There is no other author who can  so sympathetically draw you into a fully realised world of their own  creation. I cannot recommend it enough.",1
"Wow, where to begin. I literally just finished the novel, and was left with the most beautiful feeling of what it means to capture the essence of humanity. Yes! This is something you don't experience too often, and when you do you want to hold onto the feeling and never let go. I'm not going to give a plot summary, or play by play- that's what the product description and other reviews are for. This is a reaction review. I never really wanted to read this novel when it was all the rage. I would walk past it as I scanned the bookshelves, and ignore it on the best-seller list. However, when I saw the 3,000 reviews and all the positive stars mounting up, I knew people must be onto something. That coupled with my Kindle Fire Christmas present, and this is free in the Kindle Lender's Library.Where to start? From the moment you start reading, you are sucked right into Jacob's world, and the world of the circus. You find yourself running alongside Jacob, and taking part of the daily activities of the circus. The characters are highly developed, and you hate, love, and grow with each one of them. The author takes time to even develop the animals which I feel helps readers bond to the very world they now find themselves in. The story is never short of action, passion, compassion, suspense, and so much more-often at the same time. I found myself holding my breath for long durations of the novel anxiously awaiting what happens next.train In short, this novel is simply beautiful.",1
"This is a book that I can't put down, until 2 am with a 5 am wake-up.  The  premise has to be a lawyer's nightmare.  Winning a case hands down, only to  discover that your client is guilty; how can you hold your head up?  Scottoline is making a good point that lawyers DO have a conscience;  allegedly they seek justice  more than just &quot;how many billable hours  can we milk out of our client&quot;. The magnet in this story is how all  the lawyers were working independently toward the same solution, each  finding a different link.  I like Scottoline's method of ending each  chapter, just as the old-timey serials at the movies ended each week, with  the hero appearing to be heading for disaster.  And then the author  switches  to another character in action to begin the next chapter.  Since  I don't know good literature from bad literature, I have to judge what  makes my simple mind feel satisfied with the book in my hands.  This novel  has a feel-good authenticity to it.  My reason for only 4 stars?  I have to  read a second, then third, before I move Lisa Scottoline into my personal  author's Hall of Fame.",1
"Elephants Can Remember is Dame Christie's last Poiret full-length story according to most sources and written when the author was clearly playing the back nine.  This is one of the few detective novels that even I could figure out who had done it and most of the methods long before the Belgian detective assembled the remaining characters at the scene of the crime.Some will say this is Christie's weakest product.  I have not read them all so I will not make that judgement but it clearly suffers from a worn out plot and formulaic proceedings. We all know that elephants are claimed in nursery rhymes to never forget but this seems to be a revelation to Poiret and the aging writer Miss Oliver. As Christie's alter-ego, Miss Oliver is suffering the foibles of age, including total inability to recall anything or anyone, and stress over shortcomings in one's career, such as writer's block, and fear of crowds and public speaking.In a clever construct, both Poiret and Miss Oliver set out simultaneously to determine the relevant facts in a decade-old case of murder, suicide, or accidental death. Poiret warns all at the on-set that nothing good will come from this painstaking re-enactment but it seems there are always some things that daughters and odious in-laws need to know. Unfortunately for Miss Christie's reputation, she relies on a tired method of including twins in the mix so we all can see where this is going, especially when it becomes clear that the late husband had been in love with both twins.",1
"I'm a big fan of Jean Plaidy's novels.  This book provides a thorough look at The ""virgin queen""  She didn't shy away from pointing out Elizabeth's flaws, which as a fiction writer she had some liberty with.  Though Elizabeth's pattern of surrounding herself with young male courtiers and being notoriously jealous of other women is factually known, I think Plaidy nails it here and maintains a balance between portraying a strong female who was ahead of her time and knew that marriage would mean giving up her control but also one who is vain, jealous and attention seeking.Though Elizabeth was not tyrannical like her father she does share his abilities of self delusion, desperately trying to hang onto their youth and reliving their ""glory days"".  I found her behavior towards Lettice Knollys both hypocritical and unreasonable and a far cry from trailblazing queen you learn about in history class.  Plaidy provides a complete thorough portrait, in contrast to the Elizabeth inThe Virgin's Lover (Boleyn)who I found needy and gullible.",1
"Well written, acted and filmed.  Great story lines and you'll learn history along the way!  Each of the Henry's are intriguing and Wouk makes you care about them and those they love!",1
"The man whose voice it is isn't very good. He slurs, inflects where he shouldn't, is choppy, inconsistent. There are better voice-actors out there. I wish the publisher would have branched out and gotten other narrators--at least have a different narrator per book. I think this one man narrated the entire Game of Thrones series. I'll slog through because I like Thrones so much, but it's been partially ruined for me by the reader. Where are female narrators?Oh, yeh. Audible broke up the book weirdly. Finding any Game of Thrones chapter is a challenge ANYWAY, but Audible contributes to the confusion. For example, the chapter I am in is Chapter 34 (Bran 3), p 521 UK Paperback [...]. In this Audible book, it is Part 3, Chapter 11. I read alternately the paper book, Kindle book, and Audible book, trying to keep them in sync. Thank you, awoiaf.westeros.org, for your index.Giving this Audible book only three stars. Underwhelmed.",1
This book is a near perfect read. I recommend it to everyone I know. And absolute must read!!,1
these books just keep getting better. I cannot wait for the next installation. I love the direct delivery to my kindle.,1
This book is fascinating.  Not only a good book but a lesson on early 20th century America.  Classically written!,1
"I read this book to my children 35 & 38 years ago and they loved it.  My new 14 month old grandson loves it as well bringing it to read to him many times a day.  Alliterative and repetitive, when read with expression, it is great fun for us all.  I think it is out of print so I was delighted to find this.",1
...this book aims to please those readers of Spanish novels with American themes.  Give this a read.,1
"This book has everything.  War, Romance, and the little known history of the Spanish Civil War.Hemingway is at his best in this book.  His keen journalistic eye doesn't miss a detail.Although the era he is writting about has long since gone by the reader cannot help but be pushed back in time.There is one scene that always sticks in my mind.  I think Pablo's mujer is telling Robert Jordan about a village they ""cleaned"" of fascist.  The details of the brutality in that section of the book will give any reader a glipse of what war is.",1
"One of the best books written in English, ever.  Simple, yet extremely penetrating like &#34;Jonathan Livingston Seagull&#34;, deeply thought-provoking like &#34;Stranger in a Strange Land&#34;, semantically precise yet as moving as the Psalms of David, Gibran's masterpiece is timeless.",1
"The opening of The Mauritius Command brings us some changes, especially for Captain Jack Aubrey, who finds himself in the improbable role (for him) of husband and father of twins. Unsuccessful and hapless in his domestic life, he immediately jumps at the chance to leave England and take over a new command. Off the coast of Africa, Jack is promoted to commodore, putting him in command not just of his own ship but of a small fleet. In the course of the book, Jack stretches his abilities to the fullest as the British vie with the French for possession of several small islands crucial to controlling the India trade.Of course, Dr. Stephen Maturin is on hand too. His facets as doctor, naturalist, and spy all come into play in the course of the novel. The previous novel, H.M.S. Surprise, involved incredible physical suffering, loss, and rejection for Stephen so it was nice to see him get a break in this installment. However, Stephen is still haunted by what has happened to him. A dark current runs through him that no doubt will resurface in future books.The overriding issue explored in this novel is leadership and what it means to be a good leader. Jack has to deal with two very different captains serving under him, one of whom is a silly and vain man who is kind and familiar with his men and thus beloved by them. The other is a brave commander who exercises brutal tyranny with those under his rule. The weaknesses of both men lead to very different disasters.In spite of the battles and some serious turns of event, The Mauritius Command involves more action and comedy and less angst than H.M.S. Surprise, making it a lighter read.",1
"I have read alot of Lisa Scottoline books.  This is an older one I believe released in 1997.  Strong, female lead characters and fast paced legal action.  Marta Richter is about to win an aquittal for her client, millionaire businessman Elliot Steele.  During jury deliberations, she finds out that her client is guilty of the crime.  She begins a dangerous and deadly race of time to find out the truth.  I read this book in almost one sitting.  It was an easy read and kept my interest.",1
"If you love the circus and love a great, star-crossed love story, this is the book for you. The author takes us back to the days when the circus arrived by train. She pulls no punches conveying both the magic and the horror of that world. Better than the movie and highly recommended.""",1
"Looking for a light, historical adventure tale, I decided the Flashman series might fit the bill. One book was all I needed. Although this first Flashman takes you into what is supposedly a true account of the British empire's disastrous exploits in Afghanistan, I could hardly warm up to a character so self centered, cowardly, and ammoral. He's clear about himself, at least, never purporting to be anything more than a complete cad, quick to see the faults in others, quick to exploit openings for self aggrandizement. He serves as a foil for the other characters who act with honor and courage, never learning from them. And Flashman's attitude toward women, who are nothing more than sex toys, was particularly unforgivable. The book was supposed to be funny, but I never laughed. Perhaps I couldn't get into the spirit of the satire on British society. The only thing going for it was the description of how the Afghan tribes fought against the British, which has lessons for our own wars, our own hubris, in the region.",1
I have loved all of the books in the series. I have been watching the series on HBO and tried hard to pace myself along with it.  I COULD NOT STOP MYSELF,1
"Good book,  caught my attention right away with all the details about circus life.  I really enjoyed reading it.  My only qualm is with the ending because it's a little too pat for my taste.  Life doesn't ever end up so nice.",1
"This was the first Robin Hobb book I read.  What a great story.  The characters and world were so three dimensional that they almost seemed real.  Bingtown is alive with the stories of its inhabitants.  Kennit and  Althea are definitly strong characters, as is Vivacia.  I recommend this  novel to any dedicated reader of fantasy, or anyone who isn't familiar with  the multitudes of fantasy writers available.",1
"In her excellent novel ""Water for Elephants,"" one can see how much time and effort Sara Gruen put in to recreating what it was like to work for a travelling circus during the depression.  There is no romantic vision here: conditions for workers and animals alike were harsh and even brutal.  Workers and stage performers were at the mercies of greedy owners and managers whose only concern was profit.  If workers weren't needed, they might even be tossed off the circus train at night.  And the animals were treated even worse.  Jacob, the main character, finds he can't finish veterinary school due to certain tragic events, and takes a job in a travelling circus, where he's treated somewhat better than the average worker because of his healing skills.  But he falls in love with the wrong woman, and begins to fear for his own life.  Fortunately for him, there are co-workers who though mistreated, still have that spark of humanitarianism remaining.""Water for Elephants"" is a riveting story that does not shy away from acts of brutality.  However, I did have two quibbles with the book.  First, the realization that the elephant, who quickly becomes the star of the circus, possesses a rather extraordinary knowledge of a foreign language (as opposed to English) seemed a bit hackneyed to me.  Second, there was too much of a disconnect between the easy-going humane young Jacob, and the old bitter nursing home resident that he became.  Even though Jacob experienced the horrors described so vividly in the book, obviously the circus got into his blood, and he seemed to have led a relatively happy and comfortable life afterwards.  Why then did he become so bitter and unhappy?  It was as if the author forgot to write a bridge between young and old Jacob.  Even so, Gruen has written a remarkable book that will be on many ""must read"" lists for years to come.",1
I liked how the old man told the story of his life. The main character was easy to like. The love between Mar Lena and Jacob was believable. The way the old Jacob bonded to the nurse was nice. Interesting characters with a good storyline.,1
"This one of those watch the movie before you read the book! Cause I did it the other way around and kept waiting for things from the book! I loved the book, I read my sister's copy and then decided I needed a copy of my own. And I am rereading it and loving it even more!",1
This book may be a little slower than the others - but the story line keeps progressing and I'm hooked.,1
"LOVED LOVED LOVED this book, and the author paints such a wonderful, detailed picture of each character, no matter how profound to the story. I could not put this book down.If you are offended by sexual content or 'colorful' language, maybe it's not the best read for you. But understand that the content is part of the raw nature of the circus life during that time.",1
"This book gives a well-written account of the British army fighting the Japanese in Burma.  His descriptions of things like close combat, night patrols, and fighting in tropical weather are vivid.  It's a good exposition of a corner of WWII that the historians, particularly American ones, seem to have largely overlooked.",1
I couldn't put it down and was sad when it was over. I don't think I'll even see the movie because it would HAVE to be a let-down!,1
"I thought I'd give this a go due to the immense popularity James Patterson has garnered. I enjoyed this run of the mill detective novel but not as much as I enjoy Harlan Coben & Michael Connelly's detective novels. The hero ""Alex Cross"" is a detective who has psychology qualifications.Moderately recommended.",1
"Having found this book in Scotland last fall, I excitedly purchased it and set aside, only recently getting a chance to read it. This is classic Erskine and a welcome return after her last two books which seemed to be  written for the American market rather than from the heart. All the classic  Erskine elements are here: a Celtic theme, wonderful paranormal elements  and a mystery to be solved. Ms Erskine will not disappoint with this latest  offering. This one is sure to  join the ranks of KINGDOM OF SHADOWS and  LADY OF HAY in providing the reader with a full-bodied read of such depth  and mystery that even the most cynical historical reader won't be able to  put it down. Glad to see a return to what she does best; classic paranormal  fiction",1
I can't wait for the next book. This is a series worthy of comparing to Lord of the rings. I wish I knew when the next one is coming out.,1
"FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS is a masterpiece.  This historical fiction from Hemingway is in my opinion far better than the other two Hemingway novels that I have read (The Sun Also RisesandA Farewell To Arms), and for the first time triggers the same kind of admiration for Hemingway from me that I had always been so puzzled to see from others.  If you're looking for a taste of Hemingway, this is the book I would recommend.  If you've read other Hemingway and been less than impressed, try this one before you give up on him completely.This long book takes place over just a few days, and follows Robert Jordan as he works behind enemy lines during the Spanish Civil War.  While containing plenty of suspense and action, the primary focus of this book is delving into the psyches of Jordan and the irregulars he recruits for his mission.  A stark and honest look into the minds of simple people caught up in the sweeping events of a large war is something Hemingway excels at, and it really shows in this book.  While at times being perhaps a bit over the top with the rambling and inane thought processes of his characters, he seemed to ease up on it a bit with this story, instead focusing more on what was relevant and on progressing the story.  And personally, I liked Hemingway's use of Spanish and the literal translation during much of the dialogue.  Rather than being distracting, I felt that this method helped highlight the romantic nature of the Spanish language (and simultaneously reminded me of some of the basic Spanish that I had forgotten).The characters in this book are also great.  Robert Jordan, Maria, Pilar, Pablo, and Anselmo are particularly well-done and unforgettable.  Unlike other reviewers, I enjoyed the innocence and sweetness of Maria, and didn't find her to be unrealistic in either her response to mistreatment or her love for Jordan.  (Is it that she fell in love so easily? that she is so blindingly trustful? that she is universally kind? or that she manages to not wallow in self-pity, that modern day feminists hate about this character?)  Pilar and Pablo are both spectacularly done, being often hilarious and always intensely complicated.  Giving faces to these and the other irregulars in this book helps the reader realize the impact on Individuals that wars can have.As a historical fiction, this book is excellent.  You'll want to educate yourself more about the time and the circumstances around the Spanish Civil War while reading this book.  Interestingly, Hemingway himself was somewhat involved in this war, acting as a journalist, but also supposedly supporting the Republic's fight, even going so far as to help train young men in the use of modern rifles.  The content of the story comes off as being very possible, and the battles alluded to come out of real history.  Indeed, even some of the peripheral characters are historical figures, including the well-described Andr&eacute; Marty (known as the Butcher of Albacete) that played a significant role toward the end of the book.  Nicely grounded in historical fact, it makes the reading of this book all that much better.Very highly recommended!!",1
"I loved everything about this book: the characters, the settings, the pace, the story itself. I won't repeat the synopsis, as many others have done so, but this is one of those books that you still remember a few years later, with a smile. Don't pass it up! Another book not to be missed is The Help.",1
"On my list of ""Books to Read,"" I finally got around to reading Sarah Gruen's ""Water for Elephants"" and found myself up until the wee hours of the morning finishing the last breathtaking page.This is the kind of book that is so well researched and told that it captivates you - much like the circus it portrays - with feats of beauty and astonishment.I really loved this book, and was somewhat disappointed by the movie - which, as always, changes certain aspects of the book and allows for director/artistic interpretation of scenes contrary to my original interpretation. But that's the beauty of books and individual interpretation - they are your own to make as beautiful as you can imagine, guided only by the artistic mastery of the author.I saw that another individual had given this book 1 star - merely for editing on an E-Book version.  Unless every word was morphed and un-readable, I find that slightly harsh to Ms. Gruen.This is a wonderful story, that has moment's similar to the The Notebook and the movie Big Fish.  I recommend it for anyone who enjoys historical fiction and romance.  It is carefully researched and filled with drama, humor, passion and love.",1
"George MacDonald Fraser's &#34;Flashman&#34; novels are gems- great history wedding to absurdly hysterical storytelling.  Meet Harry Flashman: coward, womanizer, gambler, drunk, thief, and hero of the British Empire.  In this first adventure, Flashy joins the army, seduces a Scottish lass and is forced into marriage by her industrialist father.  Soon our hero is assigned to  the fighting in Afghanistan, where he succeeds though sheer chance.  A brilliant character and a phenomenal start to wonderful series &#34;Flashman&#34; is must reading for fans of military fiction, or lovers of great comedy novels in the English tradition.  Absolutely first rate!",1
"While ADWD was for me an entertaining read for the most part (partly because I had nothing else to do at the time), many of the stories go nowhere. GRRM said he just had too much for the sequel to a Storm of Swords to fit into one book, and so we get two books, one featuring Cersei slooooowly destroying the Lannister legacy at King's Landing, and a bunch of random side characters barely doing anything. In this one most of his 'star' characters do jack s*** as well.Tyrion: Maybe the worst chapters, aside from the first two chapters, Tyrion basically rides on a boat going to see Dany, and he basically plays Westero's chess with some Targaryan relatives that have before been completely unintroduced and have established no reason to care about them. Tyrion meets these characters and has tons of inner monologue about everyone on the ship, and with him is another midget-girl, who (as another Amazon review noted) is the equivelent of Jar Jar Binks for ASOIAF. Tyrion never makes it to his destination and instead slogs around in chapters that try to hook you, for example Tyrion seeing stone people who pull him over the ship, whoa, where's this going, did Tyrion di-DON'T WORRY, everything in the chapters afterwards are the exact same as the preceding ones, Tyrion on a boat. *SNORE*Daenery's: GURM seems to have a running theme throughout AFFC & ADWD where women apparently can't rule for s***(just like real life). Dany feeling good about freeing the city from slavery now faces starvation and disease, and prettymuch takes all of her advisers advice while she day dreams about Daario. Like Tyrion, her chapters are sluggish and neverending, and I found myself skimming through her chapters. Despite the book's title the dragons are locked up for most of the book not doing anything while we follow the mother of dragons failing miserably at ruling. Finally near the last two chapters, something starts to happen, then the book's over. Yay.Jon: His chapters are a little more interesting. He's basically trying to organize the wildlings and night's watch to work together for the impending white walkers, as well as tolerating Stannis' wife and ignoring Melisandre's advice. By the end of the book not much happened here too, but the chapters were still interesting enough to read all the way. Then he suddenly dies. Lol.Theon/Reek: By far the best chapters in ADWD, we see what was once Theon after the tortures of the Dreadfort accompany the Bolton's to Winterfell to establish their claim to the North. His chapters were not only page-turners that kept me up at night, but they were also haunting in many ways. These chapters alone made the read worthwhile.While there's some good stuff to cherry pick out of A Dance with Dragons and the read was fun for the most part, I reflected on the book afterword and realized not much happened. The major characters that established themselves in A Storm of Swords kind of just stagnate in the same place chapter-after-chapter, while the new characters are thrown into the story without any development or hook, and not much of value has happened by the end of it. In the first three books, Westero's felt like a giant chess board, each major character making a decision was like the pieces moving around the board changing the outcome drastically, but by now it feels like GURM ran out of steam. Seems after killing off a lot of major characters he doesn't know what to do with the ones he has left. I'm just going to admit it: I miss the war of 5 kings.Also why does he insist on cliffhangers now? They were in the prior books sure, but so much has happened prior that it felt like a major set up to the next book. Here, pretty much all you have is the cliffhangers. John, Briene, Cersei, and Daenary's all barely do anything until their final chapters then GURM just stops the book and says to us ""WILL THE WALL SURVIVE? WHO WILL WIN THE BATTLE OF WINTERFELL? WHAT DID BRIENNE SAY TO CATELYN? AND WILL WOMEN EVER RULE COMPETENTLY?(lol no), TUNE IN NEXT TIME TO FIND OUT!-complete with cheesy organ music in the background. How about instead of saving that s*** for the end and meanwhile writing about food in pornographic detail, GURM fleshes out the story more instead of letting it stagnate. It'll be a real shame if ASOIAF never picks up after these two slumps.",1
"I think that all fans of detective novels - particularly those of a psychological nature - will get a big kick out of these eight legs! James Patterson brilliantly keeps up the tension throughout the novel. As with great stories like this the villain seems unlikely at first but all the clues are there and it all fits!Detective Alex Cross, a hardbitten black cop / psychology major from DC, is investigating a series of gruesome deaths in the ghettos of Washington when he and his partner get dragged off on a case involving the kidnapping from an exclusive private school of two children. One is the son of the secretary of the treasury; the other, Maggie Rose, is the daughter of a famous movie star. Initially Dr. Cross is annoyed at all the attention being focussed on the privileged but he finds himself getting dragged into the case.It appears that a Gary Soneji, a teacher at the school who was so well liked he was named Mr. Chips, kidnapped the children out of the blue. As the plot thickens, leads seem to connect to the ghetto killings, one of the children turns up dead, a ransom is paid and lost and the kidnapper proves elusive. Alex Cross, vilified for his role in the handing over of the ransom, finds solice in the figure of Jezzie Flanagan - the prime secret service minder of the two children. The relationship, crossing racial boundaries, adds more tension.The figure of Gary Soneji, the alter-ego of a Gary Murphy, is a brilliant creation up there with the likes of Hannibal Lecter. At least you know where you are with Mr. Lecter - Murphy/Soneji keep you guessing all the way - scary!James Patterson brilliantly handles all of the threads, not letting any of them unravel and adding twist after clue after hint. The final unveiling of the villain is wonderful - suprising, but the clues are all there to find.",1
Hoping for the conclusion in book five but I guess I will hav to wait until book six comes out,1
"This is the second time I have read this book.  It had been a number of years since I had read this for the first time.  This time  and also first  time, when I started reading this mystery I found it was intriguing enough to make me want to read more.  I thought it was cleverly written in how the abduction of a child took place and then the cat and mouse game of catching the teacher who kidnapped her.How Alex Cross came to be drawn into working the crime, after he had stopped working any cases because of an unfortunate incident when he was in charge of another case.This was number one of a series of books about Alex Cross and I have enjoyed  every one of them.  Some more so than others but I still enjoy reading them.",1
"Book was in good shape.  Received it very quickly.  Gave it as a Christmas present, recipient very pleased with it.",1
"This was a great book! Once I started reading it...I could not stop! The story is so interesting especially for those my age, in the twenties. Sadly...I feel as though there are not as many circuses out there so learning about the circus life was pretty neat!I also really liked the flashbacks from current times to the circus times. Great story!",1
"I recently bought this edition along with War &Remembrance as a gift to my retiring assistant who herself worked for the Dept of the Navy more than 30 years.  I read the book years ago, and would recommend it to anyone without hesitation.",1
"This book ending made me angry.  Frankly, reading this Martin's series has given more frustration than pleasure.  I read 5-6 novels a week but I put his down and move to a different author all together knowing I'm going to be disappointed or frustrated. Happily the HBO series is better than the books, go figure.  I will say Martin's writing is very engaging, his attention to detail does teleport me there as an observer but his books continuations and/or endings leave me cold, wondering why I bothered.M. Archer",1
"I had numerous kin, friends and co-workers tell me to read Sara Gruen's Water for Elephants.  I told each person that as soon as I obtain the opportunity I would read the novel.  The narrator, Jacob, did an eminent job guiding the reader.  Personally I didn't feel everything he was going through, but I was able to help justify his actions.  For instance when he finally yelled at August or when he consummated his love for Marlena.  What intrigued me most about Gruen's writing was her ability to tie the ninety year old Jacob to the circus Jacob.  I was thrilled how she gave Jacob a sense of eudemonia when the book concluded.  Jacob finished up where he began; he ended up right where he wanted to be.  On a scale of 1-10 I would give this book a 9.  All in all when you read it you won't be disappointed.",1
"SAS Urban Survival HandbookThe envelpope was torn open. Hopefully nothing was removed from envelope. I bet this paperback weights about 2 lbs, or pretty close. Has everything you could need from pictures on identifing different poisonous plants, to pictures of the Fireman's lift. Then goes into details about restricted items for sea travel, also prohibited items also.  What is the difference? I guess I better read that.LOL  Even has area about dangerous dogs, hijacking, tsunami, and influenza. Easy to follow instructions, easy to understand illistrations. Like I said. It has everything you need in this book. I will keep it with my ""Just in Case supplies"" commonly known as survival supplies.",1
i loved this book. the way the author captures the essence of Jacob in his later years as well as his youth. the novel ignites your senses and awakens the soul. i loved it!,1

"Alex Cross, a street-smart psychologist, who happens to moonlight as a detective, crosses paths with the brilliant and deadly &quot;Son of Lindbergh,&quot; a multiple kidnapper, who targets Alex's children as his next prey.  A real page-turner, with plenty of plot twists and surprises.",1
"First, I must say that I rarely give a book 5 stars, especially fiction, but Mr. Clancy has created one of the most intriguing books I have read. The plot(s), characters, and dialogue are simply exceptional and for the first time with one of Clancy's novels, I can honestly say that it wasn't long enough. This a book that has it all.....action, fierce characters, compassion, heartache, oh, and did I mention ACTION. This will be one of the quickest 750 page reads you will ever have!",1
"Do not open this book unless all prior entries in the saga are part of your past and fully relevant to your future.  Approach only after fully digesting the contents of preceding material, with the characters bonded like old friends, the noble families along with their gods and legends etched in memory, and  the plot twists charted as indelible lessons.  Do not read without sufficient leisure and forged determination to pursue an uninterupted course from page one trough the final words of the epilogue.  If you come expecting resolution you are misinformed; and yet, the worlds within deliver satiation in abundance.  Short of an end, this installment lacks for nothing; and if the exploits of these noble rivals, contentious armies, exotic faiths, local tribes, judicious folk and wandering fools goes on forever, eternity will surely come too soon.  A final word of warning about the dragons - man-eating, fire breathing creatures that consume flesh freshly roasted to a crisp.  Though the full force of their impact has yet to be felt on the tale, their power is much in evidence on pages with edges singed.",1
"It happened before I finished this book. It was the final epic scene upon the bridge. You'll know the one when you get there. I started to cry. I felt it coming for a few chapters, and then finally it came out and I wept. I'd never done that with a novel before, cried, and I didn't stop myself. It wasn't that the story was the saddest thing I'd ever read or imagined. It's a Hemingway novel, and my favorite author has a way of punching you in the stomach when he's closing out a novel. For examples check out 'A Farewell to Arms' or 'Islands in the Stream'. So I wasn't too surprised to see how this epic magnificent novel was unfolding in its final tragic and violent glory. What suddenly struck me like an icy blade into my heart was the realization that I was reading the truest book that I'd ever read and probably would ever read. The enormity of that was too much to bear. I felt as if I was there, and all the emotions that came in something so highly stressful, dutiful and chaotic came flooding in. Let me say that I'm a veteran of the US Army and I was deployed to the Middle East in 2009, but that I've never shot at another person or killed anyone. But I have, however, been in numerous very high stress situations that flooded my core with anxiety and a sense of duty. Reading 'For Whom the Bell Tolls' rubbed some of those scars raw and I'm thankful for that. I'm not angered that Hemingway's utterly poignant writing showed me things that I'd left behind in the darkest days of my own life. This novel showed me, in the truest way imaginable, that there is such beauty and love to be found in duty and conflict, and it showed me that there's nothing wrong in fighting and standing your ground for something that may not survive the test of time, just as the rebel guerrillas in Spain were ultimately doomed to fail against the Fascists. Robert Jordan will now rank alongside Thomas Hudson and David Bourne as some of the most memorable protagonists of literature that I've ever had the pleasure of reading about.",1
"As a continuation of characters I've grown to love and a connection to what I am guessing may happen in future books, this held its ground. I adore this series--the world, the ruthlessness with which Martin orchestrates it, and the way he has sucked me fully and completely into anticipating future outcomes. I have theories, I want to talk to people about it. Not since Harry Potter have I been so invested.But this book doesn't stand alone. It is a piece of a whole, so as a book it falls down a little. The first three of the series were sublime, the 4th and 5th less so--he has sprawled the story a bit too thin. I just hope that in the last two he is able to pull back to the magic he created initially. I believe he will... middles are often unruly, but I suspect less patient people may be annoyed.",1
Too much unrelated detail makes the book hard to follow and adds 20% to the length of a 1000 page book.,1
This book was everything I expected from James  Patterson. I can't wait to read the next one in this series.,1
"If you love James Patterson, you will love this book.  The story is well constructed, the characters sparkle.  Alex Cross has lost his partner and is back in action with the assistance of a new side kick.  But can he trust her?  The action is fast paced and the suspense stays with you until the last page.  Who is the bad guy?  Will Alex lose this partner in his attempt to locate the Senators lost daughter? Who will die and who will survive? Alex Cross is in a race with time, and he does battle with the unique mind of a serial killer as well as a set of bad guys that comes as a surprise in the end.  Be ready to begin reading and not stop until you have reached the end.  I highly recommend this book.",1
"Mr. Penick shares a lifetime of golf wisdom in this easy to read and timeless classic.  Every golfer should have this book in their library.His humble style and sincere desire that every golfer improve (and most importantly, have fun) make this book helpful for golfers at all levels of playing ability.",1
"Written in typical Hemingwayesque ploddingly simple style, this book morphs English and Spanish in a unique manner for its period (1940), which subsequent  writers have copied or embellished. Spain is Hemingway's love.  During this time, most loved Paris - like friend Fitzgerald,.  But, dry heat and bull running mania were for  for this man.Spanish sayings abound in this novel about simple people asked to do a job - perhaps simple - in the name of the cause: blow up a bridge.  But, the pithy and poignant statements of implyingly illiterate gypsy Pilar cannot be matched by 17th century philosophers. For example Spain, in her words, is ""where blasphemy keeps pace with the austerity of religion.""When protagonist Robert Jordan speaks English for a short time to some of the group, Pilar tells him to revert to Spanish as ""no language is truer.""  She later concludes that ""Spanish is shorter and simpler.""And, Hemingway's influence on this language shows as some verbs are paradoxically used -- each time the root of Spanish for English usage.  One example is to constantly implement Spanish molestar in English sentences to ask that people stop molesting one another, when the translation is not to bother one another.But, these linguistic nuances are the special effect, the unique style, the cutting edge to the Nobel winning writing style of Hemingway.  It is the sentences of Spanglish or otherwise, compounded with his ever seemless simplification, that make this novel resound.I enjoyed this novel also for its slow beginning and its heightening to a crescendo for its  ending.  His language and other writing angles seem to mature as the novel progresses.  He slowly captures the reader, and has you under his exclusive control the last third of the book.Although Hemingway makes this a love story at a time of war, parts are seemingly unreal.  Knowing that he is going to die the next day, Robert Jordan meets one last time with beautiful Maria.  And, as they are about to start doing the deed, he stops and asks if she hurts.  I am sure that you can interview many a disagreeing  soldier under similar circumstances and ask if the concept of pain to the sexual partner ever entered their mind when they were having what would perhaps be their last moment of heaven on this man's earth - they would all agree that this was not exactly what they had in mindBut, this is a classic and worthy of reading.  I waited over 40 years between readings and received very different messages. Each time good.",1
"I am a bit Clancy fan and have read all of his recent stuff.  It was great to read one of his first novels.  Many of his recurring characters were introduced here and it was interesting to see John (Kelly) Clark as a young man just starting out.  Clancy's writing has certainly matured over the years, but this was a great, exciting read.",1
"Live the life of adventure and discovery through the eyes of Jane Goodall.  Her love of nature, animals and beauty is so evident throughout this book and you'll sit fascinated with the antics, personalities and life and existance of Jane and chimps alike.  Jane has given them all names and you'll forget at times they are animals and not human.  Her daring and bravery, as a young and adventurous girl, are awe-inspiring, creating the wishful desire to have spent time in her shoes.  Dropped in the middle of the jungle with no formal college training in animal behavior, she was to observe the Chimps with a view uncluttered by ""facts"".  The first challenge was to gain the trust of the chimpanzees so that she could get close enough to live amongst them.  With only a tent for protection, the book is the result of her years of keeping journals while living in the jungle and learning how to fit into the society of the chimps.  It's beautiful, funny and sad; but most of all amazing.",1
I collect cookbooks and happy to include this in my collection.  I have reviewed the book and plan on trying several recipes with my new clay pot.,1
its a great book and i enjoyed it as a little slow in some parts but other than that i really enjoyed it,1
As I usually do I read the book first and then saw the movie. Both were great but like all the movie changed some things. Both were good but sometimes I just wish they wouldn't change the movie.,1
I have read any reviews for this book and any stressed the message that this was a disappointment and lacked the action of the first three novels. After reading this I will admit it isn't as eventful but it adds a whole new level to Martin's world. This novel acts as a set up piece for Martin's sure to be classic final chapters. I can see why people are angry especially since they waited so long for this volume but a work this big requires time. That being said I can't wait for the next volume and the resolutions of the many cliffhangers.,1
"Water for Elephants took me by surprise. This book was really well-written. Not only does this author know how to tell a story, she educates the reader without making it unreadable. She seamlessly wove the main characters story around the unknown story of circus life during 1930s. She offers a glimpse of animal treatment, different types of jobs within and the classes that separate the workers, the expectations given by towns on entertainment, prohibition, etc. The research is evident and I welcomed and looked forward to it. The book does have romance but it has so much more depth so I read freely, not really anticipating the story between the hero and the heroine.Sara Gruen has made me a fan and has given me hope for modern writers.",1
"A feast for the literary senses, Water for Elephants makes you feel the characters' hopes, fears, and dreams. Highly recommend!",1
"Wow, 1696 reviews to date!  Oprah's recommendation really can motivate a lot of women with time on their hands LOL!  I won't even bother to read the 5-star reviews because I'll probably agree with all the specifics about what a good book this is.  It has colorful, well-fleshed out characters with only a few cardboard stereotypes, great sense of historical and circus detail, and a neat surprise ending.The trouble is, this does not belong up there with some great recent, innovative works, the true 5-stars, like Memoirs of a Geisha or The Kite Runner.  One thing they all have in common is introducing us to a foreign or unfamiliar world, in this case the depression-era circus.  But those other two books have a depth of soul, and a more comprehensive world-view, than Water for Elephants.I was also disappointed with a big, loose thread in the plot, where Camel was to be reunited with his son and the reader was set for that pivotal event, only to be let down and short-circuited by the surprise ending.You will definitely enjoy this book, and be enlightened to learn more about life during the Depression, but keep it in perspective, let's not give standing ovations for every good show.",1
"The audio C/D was EXCELLENT--use of different and well chosen voices for the younger and elderly Jacob telling a tale that spans 7 decades.The story was about LIFE and sudden curveballs thrown one's way, and the rewards/repercussions for making snap decisions at those snap moments.The background of the circus set in depression era America was a bonus.  I loved the multifaceted characters.  The author touched upon social problems that are eternal:social status based on wealth and education; physical differences/disabilities;domestic abuse;alcholism/homelessness;elderly dignity; elderly driving/vehicular manslaughter;loss and recovery of HOPE and LOVE.The character development was wonderful.  Walter was not ""just a dwarf""  He had a mother who threw him away because he would not be a help on the family farm.  Walter, though bitter still had the capacity to love--amazing . . .I did enjoy the circus setting--learned much about things I never knew while listening to a lovely connected work of fiction.  (This was no Middlesex,my favorite book af the decade; yet, it is a fine, well-written saga.)",1
"With A Dance with Dragons, the 5th novel of A Song of Ice and Fire, there is a sense that George R.R. Martin has instilled a few too many plotlines. As there are so many characters doing so many things, it makes me wonder if the story will ever be wrapped up in my lifetime. Despite this fact, I still finished A Dance with Dragons with more of a positive outlook than others might. I'd also like to point out that I was spoiled before I read this book, so whatever preconceptions or hopes I had were quickly washed away before I read even the first pages. As such, I feel like I was able to enjoy it for what it was.After killing his father in cold blood, Tyrion has left King's Landing to go east in search for Daenerys Targaryen. The talk is she is in Meereen preparing her army and growing her dragons in order to invade Westeros. As Tyrion makes his journey, he also goes through his own personal growth as he must cope with his killing of Tywin and Shae. Daenerys is having her own troubles controlling Meereen. Many different forces seem to be conspiring against her, and her rule is on the verge of being overturned. She is having to watch herself in everything she does. One wrong move, and she is done for. Meanwhile up north, Jon Snow is having a tough time getting the Night's Watch to accept the Wildings past the Wall, not to mention Stannis and Melisandre are both there as an added threat. Other plots emerge from Bran as he continues his journey north of the Wall, from Reek trying to find out what his name in his past life was, and from Arya who continues her own training to become an assassin. Of course there are several other point of view characters, as is GRRM's way.Tyrion, Daenerys, and Jon are the three that push this narrative forward. They each go through their own transformations. Tyrion never really seemed like himself this time around, but I can let that past as I didn't really expect him to be his jolly 'ol self after killing two people he knew quite well (or, at least, thought so). Dany and Jon both learn that ruling over a lot of people isn't quite what it seems, and everything they decide to do just wouldn't work. Both of them are really put through the ringer as they fail time and time again. Martin definately understands the concept of having your characters fail before they succeed. On another note, the couple of chapters from Bran were just downright beautifully written. Martin was at his best in writing these; I just wish there had been more of it.Despite all this, A Dance with Dragons is still really faulty. The first half of the novel was slow in building up its tension, and the second half seemed to have no narrative coherence. Chapters appear from characters like Jaime and Cersei without really accomplishing anything. And while there isn't an anti-climax in regards to the internal struggles, any fights or battles that might be expected never happened. There's a sense that Martin dug himself into a hole, and while I believe he has found his way out, there was no way that he was going to get out in just a novel's time. For a while I've been wondering if anything could have been done to the structure of A Dance with Dragons to give it a more satisfactory ending, but I really couldn't figure out anything that would work. The cliffhanger in Winterfell is well used, in my opinion, and wouldn't change that. It is the cliffhanger in Meereen, though, that I wish could have been better resolved. Unfortunately, I think it is quite obvious that Battle of Meereen would simply be too long. I can honestly see it taking up half of the next book.(Hopefully Martin decides to showcase the battle without pausing to go elsewhere. It would make for an exciting few hundred pages to see him go through the four or so point of view characters and no one else.)Through all its faults, I still liked the book. I thought it was entertaining, though not on the level of A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, or A Storm of Swords. I am remaining optimistic and feel confident that Martin has figured out the Meereenese knot and, as such, will get The Winds of Winter out in the next two years. He has a lot of work to do, though, with all these different characters. It's about time he kills off a few of them (and keeps them dead).I'm not sure people will enjoy A Dance with Dragons. It is a lot of build up but not much else. I enjoyed it for what it is -- another piece of a very long story. Very long.3.5/5",1
"This was a great book. Very different from the other Clancy books that I have read, but very good none the less. While Clancy's books deal with espionage, and war, this book takes those aspects and put them in the background. Shoved to the foreground is a revenge story. This is a great book with characters that you care about, and some very exciting action sequences. This book is highly recommended.",1
"If you haven't reas WITHOUT REMORSE yet, then you don't really understand how good of a writer Clancy is.Set during the early '70s, this novel is the backsttory for John Kelly AKA Clark, the CIA operative who figures extensively throughout Clancy's Jack Ryan series. As much a morality play as adventure, this book explores Clark's life from happily-married Navy veteran to CIA operative. Clark battles his demons, both real and imaginary until he is forced by circumstance to risk it all.The book is technically accurate, and excellent in both character and plot development. It's a page turner and never predictable. I've reread it several times and continue to enjoy the nunaces that escape one on a first read. It would be a great movie if Hollywood wouldn't butcher it like, say, SUM OF ALL FEARS.You won't regret buying it.",1
"Great book!  I wish I had bought in hard back instead of electronically, but the electronic version works well.  It is just harder to find my place if I lose it for some reason.",1
"Water for Elephants is one of the best books I've read in a long time. This book was mentioned several times in the House at Riverton book club I participated in; and was a huge seller during the holidays on Amazon.  I figured even though it wasn't a book I would normally pick up and start reading, I would give it a try.I'm so glad I did!The story setting was depression era circus life...more than intriguing! Sara Gruen did an amazing job with her research and the detail she outlined in the book.  She was able to find a perfect balance of grisly and romantic.  Gruen used that same ""memory sequence"" style of storytelling as The House at Riverton, Titanic, and Rebecca.  The flips from past to present were seamless.Gruen's depiction of the narrator as a 98 year old man was awesome.  She allowed the reader to understand the traumas of being ""that old"" as well as remind us there's often a pretty amazing story to most of the older generation.Each character had a function in the story, including the nursing home staff.  There were no superficial characters and every single character helped you to understand ""who"" the main character was.This was one of those fun reads that sucks you in and makes you wish the story could go on forever.  I ended the book feeling like I wanted to join a circus, wanted a pet elephant, and wanted to work in a nursing home.  All very strange, indeed!  Its not often a book I read can make me want to do anything remotely close to those things.",1
"I previously read the Boleyn Inheritance by Philippa Gregory and in comparing the two versions of Katherine, I have to say that I wish I had read this book first. I believe Jean Plaidy honored Katherine Howard whereas Phillipa Gregory made her out to be a spoiled brat.Jean Plaidy dove deep into Katherine's upbringing and now I understand why she was so naive and sweet. Katherine expected everyone to be like her; kind and sweet, sympathetic of others. But in Henry VIII's era, who really was?This book also describes Henry VIII as the miserable 'fat' man that he was, but Katherine felt so sweetly towards him because he made her feel loved and wanted, something she always needed. And she was not ashamed to give it back, something which Henry VIII yearned for utterly, like a little boy. In a way, I think Henry and Katherine Howard were a perfect match- both children deep inside.I loved this book. It was a fast and easy read that had me captivated from page one-but then again every Jean Plaidy book I have read has done the same. She does not disappoint!",1
"The Earth has been fully mapped.  No matter, for Kim Stanley Robinson has invented a new universe... a universe for daydreamers and adventurers alike, a civilization of words born on that crimson neighbor floating in the night sky.  Robinson may one day be known as the father of ""integrated-humanity"" fiction... he is at least at the vanguard of twenty-first century science fiction.Red Mars begins on colonized Mars in the middle of the twenty-first century.  Under the pressurized tent city of Nicosia, Frank Chalmers, one of the original mission leads, sits in a state of stressful anticipation.  He is planning something diabolical... to him, it's only politics.  A festival of migrated humanity swirls about him... Arabs, Swiss, Americans, Russians, united in celebration.  Then, as minutes pass, the crowd starts to quiet... news spreads.  Fear and dread pass from person to person like a virus, and everyone scrambles.  In the next several panic-filled moments, we are introduced to the primary leaders of this new Martian civilization... one of whom now lies dead.We now step back to an earlier date, December 2026, during the voyage from Earth to Mars.  Maya Toitovna, official leader of the Russian contingent, is one of the one hundred men and women, primarily Russian and American scientists, who have embarked on this 300-day journey to the barren red world.  As Mars draws closer, preparations are made, assignments handed out, and the political discussions ensue.  Some will land on Phobos, one of two natural Martian satellites, others will begin construction of the first town.  The lines of power are being drawn.  But for now, everyone is excited about the endeavor in front of them... a new world, so much potential, the beginning of history... and so much to build!  Ideals conflict, but there's enough planet and enough adventure for everyone.We learn much about Maya, too.  A fierce temper to match her fierce beauty... a woman who could ""impale you with a look"", a woman not afraid to ""let the knives show"" when she thought a discussion was becoming irrational.  She is a definite leader, and she contributes to every aspect of the endeavor.  But she is anxious.  She lays her sexual fingerprint on both American mission commanders, John Boone and Frank Chalmers... sometimes one of them occupies her moods.  She is in control of everything, everything except her psychology.  The confinement and the personality conflicts push against her.  Demons are forming in the shadows of dreams.Robinson not only introduces us to Maya, John, Frank, and five or six other near-primary characters, he places their challenge in our mind, blending science, politics, and psychology with the extant cultures onboard.  His vision is readily digestible, and we are hooked.  The ship lands on Mars, and we turn to page 92.Nadia Cherneshevsky has plans for this red world.  So she gets to work. ""Very quickly, she became the colony's chief troubleshooter, the universal solvent as John had called her.""  As well as the colony's primary architect.  She loves this enterprise more than any she's ever experienced... she works by herself and with others.  ""There was something so fluid about tired muscles at the end of a day's construction work.""  Her reputation grows as her ability shines.  ""Mutual professional respect, a great maker of friendships.  And so nice to talk about nothing but business.""  Nadia lives through the arms of her machines, fueled by the world that will be.  ""A compulsion, a life with a goal, how could you tell the difference?""  We are actually present as the first city evolves, fostered by this engineering Mother Ares.  And we are still only 1/3 through this story!Red Mars is divided into 8 parts, each lived through a different primary character.  We vicariously experience the colonization and expansion of Mars through Frank, Maya, Nadia, and mission commander John Boone, as well as Michel Duval, the psychiatrist and one member who didn't request this post, and Ann Clayborne, an irascible scientist who turns red-environmentalist.  This forms within the reader an intense intimacy and understanding of each person's psychological makeup.  When we discover the character of the pioneer killed in Part 1, we comprehend the profound loss to the group entire.But Red Mars isn't tragedy... it's sheer reality.  Robinson writes the best ""science science-fiction"" of any major author out there.  Arthur C. Clarke himself wrote of Red Mars: ""A staggering book... the best novel on the colonization of Mars that has ever been written...  It should be required reading for the colonists of the next century.""  Robinson's scientific research is impeccable, as is his awesome understanding of world cultures.  The reader becomes a citizen of the world by first becoming a citizen of Mars.The men and women of Red Mars overcome much in this volume: the planet's forces, internal factions, the politics of city-building and immigration from Earth; and the joy is in the details.  ""It was a world of acts, and words had no more influence on acts than the sound of a waterfall has on the flow of the stream.""  This book spans decades of acts and actions, individual and collective.  By the end of the book, Mars has undergone large-scale terraformation, introduction of biological agents, and mass emigration from Earth.  The planet's potential has been noticed and exploited (in both positive and negative manner) by religious groups, transnational corporations, and Earth nation-states.  The undercurrent of revolution is strong in this still colonial wilderness, and threatens to explode at any moment.  (The subconscious parallels made to America in this book are utterly fascinating.)This is challenging fiction, written by the man who would probably be elected mission commander if the shuttle left for the red planet tomorrow.  Robinson has so much to teach, and his work spans humanity like few authors before him, fully integrating technology, friendship, war, politics, government, sexuality, medicine, terraforming, psychology, environment, and science.  This book would be a wise choice for a college humanities curriculum.",1
"Back in the day, many years ago, reading an Agatha Christie was must reading. After reading John Curran'a book Agatha Christie's secret notebooks, I decided to re-visit Hercule Poirot. So far I have read 30 and the third girl ranks amoung the top 25. Red herrings, mystery,a story line that keeps you guessing and of course Hercule with his friend Mrs Oliver, (she is Agatha Christie's ulta ego). A missing girl, who claims she shot someone, or so she thinks, and her friends think nothing about not seeing her for days, including her family.  When Agatha wrote this book it was in the '30's, and still today it is timeless. Did she kill someone, is she really missing, and why did she think Hercule was to old to help her?",1
"From August 2009:I'm still working out how I feel about this book. It was so well written, goes seamlessly between the past and the present. The love story (was it between he and Marlena or he and Rosie?) was lyrically written. The author did an amazing job of pulling me back and forth between the two. I even shed a few tears over a few different things. I'm not an animal activist, but certain parts of this book made me very uncomfortable. The history of the circus is pretty well known. We know the animals were mistreated (heck, they are today too), but the author writes so well about this subject that I found it hard to swallow that lump in my throat. It's obvious she did some major research into the subject matter.When I originally read the description for this book, it was on my ""skip it"" list, but a few of my friends read it and told me I ""had"" to read it. I'm so glad they did. This was a beautiful book and definitely in my top 10 for the year.=======================February 2010:I read this one just six months ago but someone in my book club chose it so I decided to re-read it. It's always interesting when I read a book a second time, especially if it was one that I really enjoyed (and this was definitely a book I enjoyed immensely.I noticed things I didn't notice in the first read, probably because I knew what was going to happen so I found a lot of the little quirky foreshadowing and things. The prologue, of course, caught me and a lot of ""ahhh..."" moments.This is a book you must read. It really is that simple. I had looked at it a few times, but it really didn't look like anything I would want to read, so I kept skipping it. A friend of mine insisted I read it last year and I'm glad she did. It's absolutely wonderful! Read it.",1
"I cheated and basically watched Game of Thrones and Clash of Kings on HBO's series. I've read storm of swords, feast for crows and I'm 1/2 way through Dances with Dragons. Storm of swords was excellent and feast for crows was a nice change of pace but now I must confess that either I'm losing interest or the story line is getting tiresome. George Martin is a brilliant writer - very detailed and descriptive, a little too descriptive in my mind. There are some very exciting events that take place in the book but it takes 100 pages of background information and descriptions of characters and scenery to get to it.",1
"James Patterson, with this first Alex Cross novel, has written a classic.  ALONG CAME A SPIDER is a gem.  It is a world class highly sophisticated thriller for the ages.  It is a heart stopping thrill ride of the imagination, a ride into darkness so deep you wont know which direction is up.The emotions of the reader are guaranteed to run high when two celebrity children are kidnapped, and when it turns out they are held by a mass murdering psychopath, your eyes and your hands are guaranteed to be glued to your kindle for the duration of the read.We are introduced to the legendary and brilliant Washington Detective, Alex Cross.  His wife was killed in a drive-by shooting three years ago but he is still grieving.  His partner, John Sampson, is a life long friend.  Cross and his two children are living with his grandmother who still volunteers at the local primary school.  Cross the man has an incredible career - and amazing potential -  ahead of him and given his background, he is understandably happy to stay (in Washington) where he feels he can achieve the most for the common good.  But there are people above him who can see his talents and intelligence (he has a PhD in Psychology) and are consequently pushing him toward higher things.  So there is tension on several levels in this fine, fine tome.The kidnapper is a lunatic. Seriously.  Mr Gary Soneji is a mass murdering delusionist who kills for the fun and self imposed glory of it all. After slashing the throat of a high powered member of the FBI, the reader finds him crying out for a challenge in his life.  Well, guess what buddy!  Alex Cross is about to give you a challenge you will never forget!We also meet 24 year old blonde bombshell and secret service agent, Jezzie Flanagan, who comes to work everyday on a high powered black BMW sports motorbike.  She too is a highly qualified cast member of the story and those in the know recognise her for what she is.  A player.And so to the writing.  It is beautifully balanced, with excellent building of suspense and tension as you progress through the story.  The characters are fantastically created and each have their own set of histories.  The book itself has longer and deeper chapters than the newer releases from the world famous writer and the book feels more solid as a result.  The language is strong - another difference from the newer books but given the setting of the characters and their histories, I guess the reader can overlook this.  The book is violent.  It certainly is not funny.  That would be totally ridiculous.  There are moments of poignancy and emotion scattered like grains of chalk across an empty blackboard.  It has an excellent feel and will make the reader deeply, deeply satisfied at the end.And so to the ending.  It is quite extraordinary.  It is multi-directional with twists and turns. And chops and changes.  You wont know where to look except for at the white of your kindle screen, or the psperback you sre holding.  And the final chapter is exquisitely thrilling, exciting and nail biting.  A final moment of poignancy finishes this classic thriller of the 1990s and you will find yourself a little sad at book's end.  Another true sign of greatness.  At least there are 20 more books to read.I think i have said enough.  This is one of the modern day classics of the genre and i consider myself privileged to have come across it so long after it was released.  The world owes it thanks to James Patterson for giving us such a fantastic tale and yet another superhero to stand up against the evils that exist in our world.BFN Greggorio!",1
"I got WATER FOR ELEPHANTS as a gift from my husband. When I opened it I said to myself, why on earth did he buy me this? I aked him what prompted him to chose it - he said because I've had a life long fascination with Freak Shows and they're part of the Circus. OK. Fair enough.If it hadn't been for him buying it for me I would have missed out on what has become my favorite piece of fiction I have ever read.I am in love with this book.This book is enchanting. The characters are, variously, loveable, hateworthy, pathetic, nasty and dastardly.Sara Gruen knows her characters so well and writes them with such passion they seem real. You will feel that you know them too. And the writing is so vivid you will feel like you're standing ring-side. Inhale deeply - can you smell the cotton candy?And the ending of this book is the most perfect, satisfying ending I have ever, ever read.I'm not going to pigeon-hole it with category or genre and risk putting some people off...like me.There are some Book Club talking points at the end of the paperback version and one such talking point is to discuss the book's 'pathetic glamour.' That is a perfect descriptor. The circus fakes its glamour and its glitz; the daily lives of the crews who work it are anything but, and at times are brutal, harrowing, even.I've learned a valuable lesson from this book - what I want as a reader is just writing that takes my breath away. I got that from WATER FOR ELEPHANTS.",1
"I try to read anything written by this author and this book did not disappoint. His character development is clear and the timelines are consistant with the historical events he refers to in the story. Overall entertaining and, as with his other books, hold your attention. My one complaint would be that it takes almost the entire book for the obvious to be stated by the main characters.",1
"SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT I READ THIS BOOK.  I HAVE OBSERVED PEOPLE READING THIS BOOK ON AIRPLANES, IN CARPOOL LINES, SITTING ON A BENCH AT BARK PARK, SO I DECIDED IT WAS A MUST READ JUST TO FEEL LIKE I BELONGED IN A SOCIETY.  THE BOOK IS INTERESTING, PARTICULARLY IF YOU WERE FASCINATED WITH THE CIRCUS AS A YOUNG CHILD.  I FOUND THE ANIMAL BRUTALITY A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO READ, ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOT AS BRUTAL AS I HAD ANTICIPATED, BUT WHAT I DID MOSTLY REMEMBER AT THE END.  IT'S A GOOD READ, NOT A GREAT READ.  THE ONLY FLAW I WOULD MENTION IS THE NARRATOR'S VOICE WAS NOT PLAUSIBLE AS A NINETY YEAR OLD MAN.  THE AUTHOR MIGHT HAVE DONE A LITTLE RESEARCH IN THAT AREA, BUT DON'T LET THAT STOP YOU FROM READING THE BOOK.",1
"Great book, really sucks you into the story and for feel for this band of characters. The movie does not do it justice.",1
I have 2 degrees in English Lit and this is my all-time favorite book. Hemmingway is my favorite author and I believe this is his best novel.,1
"I enjoyed reading the book and I really liked how it all wrapped up in the end.  The only thing I didn't like was the flipping back and forth from past to present.  I didn't really see any need.  And, I wished that there wasn't a prolouge (seemed to give something away ...too soon).  Although, the characters were great and the book was fun.",1
"I just finished this book and all I can say is wow. A beautifully written novel that just shocks you in the end. I was completely stunned and I think this might be my new favorite by Christie. You will never see the end result coming, even though she gives you hints throughout the whole book. A great journey into the deths of the human mind. I am surprised that this is one of her lesser known titles, it was brillant. A must read, Agatha Christie has outdone herself again.",1
"Katherine was a young girl, very lovely in the manner of Ann Boleyn (she is also her cousin) whose strength was also her downfall. She appealed to Henry VIII - who just has divorced Ann of Cleves - because she was everything that Ann was not. Fair, pleasing and not very clever. She is used as a pawn by her uncle - Duke of Suffolk to get back the power from the Seymours who have the King's favour. She goes along with it - with some misgivings because of her past which is chequered to say the least. I felt that she probably made Henry most happy of all his wives. When the dark clouds of Katherins's unsavoury past start clouding over, there is a place where you think that both Henry and Katherine are pawns of the men around them- for if they had met, he surely would have forgiven and taken her back. It leaves you wondering, about Henry VIII, about the follies of youth which some commit and grow beyond... A very absorbing tale, if a  little sad ...",1
Got this book for my son who wasn't familiar with Kahlil Gabran. Everyone should read him at least once don't you think? The book was more attractive than pictured and small - fits in his pocket. He likes it.,1
"I actually read this book over 20years ago, but felt compelled to write this recommendation, since this book was one that I could never forget.I thought it was ground-breaking for the time, and left such an indelible mark on me. The style of this book is very different from her previous books, and the pace is perhaps slower too, but climaxes to a startling and shocking end.The revelation of the schemers and murderer blew me away, and left an everlasting impression on the child that I was at the time.I fear reading this one again, as the years that have passed may spoil the milieu and tone that I had felt to be such an integral part of this mystery.Hats off, Mrs.Christie. You have immortalised yourself.",1
"3.5 starsI don't know how to feel about this book. I don't know that I like it any better or any worse than A Feast for Crows, which was my least-favourite book of the series thus far. And I was, if not expecting, at least hoping to like this one a lot better, because I so many more of my favourite characters were in this one. And there were certainly parts I enjoyed a lot. But there were a lot of parts that frustrated me, a lot of parts that bored me, and a lot of parts that felt completely extraneous. It's definitely in need of judicious editing. I sort of get the feeling that his editors, so happy to have him finally declare it finished, didn't actually spend much time editing before sending it to print. Apart from a lot of unnecessary repetition and a lot of extraneous material, I also found five typos.So, overall -- I'm giving this 3.5 because I just sort of don't know what to do with it. There were quite a few moments that genuinely excited me. But there were a lot of things that frustrated me, that needed editing, or that should've been held off till the next book. And there are so many things left unanswered, so many arcs that began in this book or in Feast that have yet to see any kind of fulfillment whatsoever... Well, I guess we're in for another five or six frustrating years until The Winds of Winter comes out.Full, spoiler-heavy review at: [...]",1
What do you say about such a classic.  Many classic writers are difficult to read but EH takes you through the story with brilliant ease and depth if characters.,1
"I am a nurse.  I love working with the geriatric population.  This story was amazing.  The author hit the nail on the head with the way that elderly are often treated and forgotten, but can have so much to offer.  They are a wealth of knowledge and entertainment.  Very very well written!",1
I loved it... just hard to get started. Diff. from what i normally read. LOVED IT!! It was a quick read once i got started.,1
"There's an old saying. ""Write what you know."" Alistair MacLean is Scottish, and so consequently, what he knows most is how to write British characters (and, weirdly, Germans - he tends to write them fairly well). Americans? Not so much. In fact, I've yet to encounter a believable American character in a single one of his books, and the otherwise excellent Ice Station Zebra is a good example of this.In novels such as The Guns of Navarone and Where Eagles Dare, this problem is limited because each of those books has only a single American in them, but in Ice Station Zebra, we get an entire American submarine crew, and MacLean's inability to write believable Americans becomes glaringly apparent.I don't mean their personalities and motivations - I mean their dialogue. Every time an American character opens their mouth, nothing they say rings true. Everything from how they phrase things to their banter to their word choices, is distinctly British. It reads like MacLean has never met any American servicemen, and wrote their dialogue based solely on what he'd experienced living in the UK. The end result is a bunch of American submariners who sound like British guys.While the novel, overall, is excellent (suspenseful, exciting, etc.), I think it's obvious that MacLean bit off more than he could chew by trying to write an entire American submarine crew. He should've just had them be British.",1
"Beginning with &quot;The first six words I'll teach my pup are 'dig a hole' and 'fill it up.'&quot;  this book is absolutely hilarious.  I had never heard of it before my son came along, but it is one of his favorites  and mine.  It is whimiscal, clever, and just plain fun:  &quot;have a care,  don't paint the mayor.&quot;  The cadence and flow of the words are  masterful.This nugget will surprise you.  I hope you enjoy it.",1
"Martin has created a vast and colorful tapestry, so I don't mind conceding action for some deep-dive plot development. This would have been easier to digest if it hadn't taken 5 years to get cooked up (I'd forgotten all but the A-list characters). I just hope the remaining books come out faster and that the thousands of pages have been ""worth it"". I'd like to give it 0 stars for taking 5 years to write, but that wouldn't be fair to the book!",1
"Bought it in hardcover, but it is so large that I went with a Kindle edition because I couldn't hold it for long enough to read.  Sometimes Martin's near obsession with endless goofy names and a parade of seemingly random characters is exasperating and appears to add needlessly to the length, but stay tuned .. by golly, it all comes together in the end, and what an incredible tale he tells!  You've never been anywhere like the Seven Kingdoms, and never will, not even in your own imagination, outside of this remarkable saga.  To say that it has everything, and more, is an understatement.  And there is a tremendous sense of accomplishment when you are done .. &#34;I finished Ice and Fire&#34; .. something akin to having joined a special club, the Mt. Everest Pinnacle Climbers.  Of course no one starts with book five, so you know all of this anyway.",1
"These books are amazing! So far the 3rd installment is my favorite, but I still love every single one and hope that there are many more to come!",1
"I bought  A Companion Guide to Rome by Masson based on 5-star recommendations from Amazon, and for me it was not a worthwhile purchase.  The authors (it has been revised several times) offer infinite detail and historical tid bits, but it actually offers little that wasn't already in the Green Guide, and it is too heavy and too much reading in my opinion to do on site, while walking around. It was a nice reference, but I should have looked for it in the library and just borrowed it.",1
"Water for Elephants was a great book! Loved the transition from young Jacob to old Jacob, the parallels between the circus and the circus that was the nursing home. I could have done without some of the language but all in all the book had me hooked from the beginning. I recommend this book for anyone interested and unsure. It will not disappoint.",1
"As always, a pleasure to read...this last book leaves me wanting the next. The books ends with many issues impacting all of the characters in need of being resolved ..I'm very curious about Daenerys and Tyrion and  Jon Snow and Arya .... and the dragons!.  I am also curious about Theon an Asha..... and curious about the Others .Someone mentioned that they felt sorry for Cersi in this book - I have a feeling that the events that happened to her in this book will only spur her onto more evil and cruel endeavors in the futureI can't wait for the next book",1
"As always, George does not disappoint. These are my favorite books and I absolutely love to read them over and over again. My only complaint is how long it takes for the next book to come out. Other than that, I own these books both in hard copy and digital format. Very entertaining!!!",1
"Guy Gavriel Kay first made his mark on fantasy by working with Christopher Tolkien on the legendary ""Silmarillion."" His SECOND mark was the Fionavar Tapestry, a flawed but prettily written fantasy trilogy. First book ""The Summer Tree"" is an entertaining read, but Kay was clearly still getting into the idea of writing an original book.Five college students are chatting with a visiting professor, Lorenzo Marcus, who is accompanied by a peculiar dwarf. Suddenly the mysterious man reveals that he is a mage, Loren Silvercloak, and whisks them all into the world of Fionavar. He asks them to come stay awhile -- but none of the students know the strange destinies that bind them to Fionavar. Worse, one of them -- Dave -- vanishes during the crossing.The four friends soon learn of the sinister political and supernatural problems in Fionavar. An evil wolf is lurking around, and the evil svart alfar are killing the beautiful lios alfar (elves). Suddenly sweet-natured Jennifer is kidnapped and tortured by the evil god, the Unraveller. And Paul offers his own life for the sake of Fionavar -- to be hung on the Summer Tree as a human sacrifice.Take the world-crossings of Narnia, and the mythic qualities of Tolkien. That pretty much describes ""Summer Tree."" It's not terribly original, and the plot doesn't really work until about halfway through the book. But it hints at future grandeur, and makes good use of its old Celtic legends and customs in a typical fantasy setting.The biggest flaw of ""Summer Tree"" is unoriginality -- Kay lifts ideas from Robert Zelazny and J.R.R. Tolkien, and combines them with a heavy dose of Celtic mysticism and a bit of Arthurian legend. Sure, these are hardly unusual -- but it's hard not to flinch at a lios alfar describing his people to Jennifer. It's an exact description of Tolkien's elves, down to a copy of the Undying Lands.Kay's writing is exceptional, however -- lush, detailed, and rich. He can enspell you, or horrify you. Most compelling is Jennifer's rape -- Kay doesn't get graphic with the details, but her horror and violation are ghastly. At the same time, descriptions of the lios alfar, visions, spells and the strange creatures that populate Fionavar are almost intoxicating. The scenes were Paul hangs on the tree are stunning and powerful.One small problem is that Kay seems to have a little trouble with his lead characters -- he's a little too eager to get them into their respective places. None of them seem very disturbed over being snatched into another world, and expected to become a part of it. And the college students are actually the flattest people in the whole book -- the kindly king, womanizing prince, stern wizard and vindictive priestess come across as much more real.There are deep flaws in ""The Summer Tree,"" but its luxuriant prose makes it a worthwhile read. But hopefully the second and third books can reach beyond the limitations of the first.",1
"This book was out of this world. We have a story that goes back and forth between past and present, sometimes a present that he can't remember much of. Our hero is twenty-three and almost ready to take his final exam, when he receives word that both of his parents were in a car accident and have passed away. Leaving no money and feeling desperate Jacob jumps on a moving train. Having no idea he has jumped on a circus train, he decides he has nothing left and starts working with the circus.He meets a beautiful woman, but finds out quickly she is married to a mad-man. However, she returns the attraction and we have a great love story, combined with their love of animals. This story was so rich with character details I just couldn't put it down.When the book starts, it made me think Marlena brought the stake down on August's head, but that isn't the case. Just wait till you find out who did! What a book. Took my breath away with a great story line. A true weaver of stories, thank you Ms. Gruen.",1
"A really great Kindle read.  Non-intellectual that I am, I assumed the original BBC series was a pure TV plot.  Only when the American version showed up did I learn that Michael Dobbs was not only a real life person, but also an honest to goodness inner member of the Thatcher government.The BBC series was an almost page for page retelling of the three books so, if you have seen the series, there are not to many surprises in the book.  Despite that, the sheer beauty of the text makes it a page turner.  The only true difference is that in the BBC version, after each piece of villainy, Ian Richardson would turn sweetly to the camera and in that great oily voice calmly explain exactly what he did and why.  These lectures are missing from the book.  All is not lost, however.  Each chapter starts with a pure political reality quote, presumably by Francis,  that takes your breath away.""Politics comes from the Greek word ""Politico"" which means the mass of people.  A Tick is a small bloodsucking creature.""""The Bible says many times you must forgive your enemies.  Nowhere does it ever mention that you must forgive your friends.""A true bummer, however, is that only the first book of the trilogy is available on kindle.  This might be explained by the author's notes that this version of ""House of Cards"" is a new edition that has been largely rewritten and reissued in conjunction with the American Netflix version.  All was not lost.  After a search I was able to find the two remaining parts as used books from Amazon.As an aside, if you have not started into the Kevin Spacey remake on Netflix, I would recommend you start with the BBC original, also available from Netflix.  Kevin Spacey is good in his quest for power, but Ian Richardson was incredible.  You think Walter White is a villain whom you have cheer?  He isn't fit to be in the same room with Francis Uquhart.",1
"This is one of the best books I have read in a while.  I loved the characters and the talent of the author to intertwine them with the story line.  I could not put the book down and hated when it ended.  I have not seen the movie yet, and am not sure I want to since I enjoyed the book so much.  I would highly recommend it.",1
I'm about 2/3 through this book and I am so glad I read the reviews on it.  Besides learning a lot about the North countries it's been downright fun!  I'd recommend this book to just about anyone.,1
"I liked this story and I think others will, too.  It has a good plot and interesting characters.  I just don't consider it is one of the best books I've ever read.",1
The detailsand twists and turns are awesome.  This book was awesome!  Not a lot of battles but great stories.  Cant wait for the nect one!,1
"I purchased this book per recommendation and thoroughly loved the book. Great storyline and an enjoyable read, it has become one of my favorites.",1
"The title seems to have no connection, but the story is good. The end just seems to happen fast and good bye. Not like the several others I've read. I'll try another though.",1
"George martin delivers again, the detail, the plot twists, the ever engrossing word of wonder and fantasy, I literally can not wait fir the sixth",1
"If you're in the mood for an epic drama involving hypnosis and past-life regression during modern times, faced against historical Welsh fiction, then Barbara Erskine's Lady of Hay is definitely the book to read. What an extraordinary novel!Lady of Hay is the story of Jo Clifford, a head-strong journalist who falls prey to being an easy subject for past-life regression within hypnosis, or even reincarnation. When Jo is under hypnosis, she lives the life of Matilda de Braose; a woman head-strong in her OWN time during the late 12th and early 13th centuries. Not only does Jo bring components of Matilda back to present time (scars and bruises for example), but we also begin to learn that her present-day lover Nick and his brother Sam are also present-day men that knew Matilda. WHAT?! you may ask?Lady of Hay is abundantly full of intrigue, suspense, and violence, and is good enough to keep your interest despite its length of over 700 pages. Lady of Hay will pull you in; and its combination of past and present events are distributed evenly and tastefully throughout the book. We become frustrated that Jo is forever drawn to Nick, whose past-life character continues to hurt her, and we also become emotional when dealing with Matilda's life woes and hardships. The only aspect of the book I disagree with is Jo's weakness in regards to Nick. I figured a strong, intelligent woman would not keep succumbing to Nick's advances. The redundancy of Jo constantly returning to Nick becomes annoying as we reach the end.Although the novel was written in 1986, Lady of Hay is still very much a classic. The dialogue between the present-day characters is a little time-sensitive and old-fashioned, but it does not deter from the storyline and the joyful experience of the book.Lady of Hay is Barbara Erskine's debut novel, and I am disappointed that I did not learn about the author sooner. Barbara Erskine is now very prolific in historical fiction featuring Wales, and her latest title is called Time's Legacy. I plan on adding all of Erskine's novels to my wish list for future reading!",1
"All in all, I liked the fast-moving plot, interesting characters and the mystery of trying to find out just who the bad guys were.  There is a problem with the book, however, because the author decided to do too much too quickly.That whole business with the trial and the unusual defense could have been made into a seperate book easily, but combining a trial with a kidnapping made for two weakenned storylines instead of one strong one.Also, I didn't care for Gary at all.  I guess I just don't 'get' those kind of villians.  I preferred Jezzie.",1
"The Other Boleyn girl tells the story of Mary, King Henry the VIII's mistress before he met and married Mary's sister, the more well-known Ann.This is a great story, beautifully written and completely interesting from beginning to end.  Written from Mary's point of view, the story elaborates on the theme that both Mary and Ann were pawns in the Boleyn family's push for upward mobility.This is the first book I have read by Philippa Gregory, and I am looking forward to receiving The Queen's Fool so that I may read that, as well.  There are events in her novel, however, that some historians do not believe occurred.  For instance, in this book, Henry fathers Mary's first two children while she was married to (but living separately from) her husband.  Some historians dispute this allegation and believe that Mary was the king's mistress prior to her marriage and that her children were the offspring of both Mary and her husband--and concieved very much after the affair ended.  Regardless, these are events that will most likely always be in dispute and have been, thus far, impossible to prove definitively either way.  And, Philippa Gregory chooses the option that makes for a better story and more empathetic character.  Good for her.This novel transports the reader through time and is difficult to put down. I also recommend The Autobiography of Henry VIII, by Margaret George, for another fictionalized first-person account of this era in British history.",1
"Book DescriptionAs a young man, Jacob Jankowski was tossed by Fate onto a rickety train that was home to the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. It was the early part of the great Depression, and for Jacob, now ninety or ninety-three, the circus world he remembers was both his salvation and a living hell. A veterinary student just shy of a degree, he was put in charge of caring for the circus menagerie. It was there that he met Marlena, the beautiful equestrian star married to August, the charismatic but twisted animal trainer. And he met Rosie, an un-trainable elephant who was the great hope for this third-rate traveling show. The bond that grew among this unlikely trio was one of love and trust, and, ultimately, it was their only hope for survival.[...]This book came to us as a recommended read from several sources. Once selected, we could not possibly put it down. The author, Sara Gruen, builds the detailed and fantastic world of a travelling circus during the Great Depression from the ground up! The story of Jacob Jankowski is one of sorrow, love and at times terrifying. His constant emotional struggles can be related to by many readers (though perhaps not as fantastical) and will captivate the imagination. The other characters Gruen constructed are perhaps the most remarkable outside of young Jacob, as with any circus, they all act their parts accordingly ... with flawless precision.One does not need to be a circus aficionado or historical reader to take pleasure in this novel, for it contains a little of everything to captivate any bookworm. We guarantee you will not be able to put this one down!",1
"John Clark is my favorite Clancy character. Thus, when I heard about this book I picked it up and read eagerly. I was not disappointed. This novel was a fascinating look into how John Kelly, ex Navy SEAL, became John Clark, CIA allstar.Anyone who enjoyed John Clark's lesser roles in Clancy's other books should definitly pick this one up as well.",1
"Boy runs away to the circus, then does it again in his old age.  Lots of adventure for him.  Warm fuzzies.",1
"I read Winds of War as well as War and Remembrance 30-something years ago, and ever since have felt that they were the best, most compelling books I had read in my life.  That's never changed, despite having read hundreds of books since then.  So I put Winds of War on my Kindle and am rereading slowly, savoring each chapter this time through.If you haven't read them, do so.  You won't regret it.",1
"Flashman is purposely a despicable, unlikeable fictional character who helps us understand the unbelievable British arrogance that led to the 1842 military disaster in Afghanistan, sadly reminding us that history repeats itself.",1
Well I can't say anything more then what has already been said about this book.  It is a very good read and I certainly recommend it.,1
Henri Nouwen again in REACHING OUT inspires and provides a mental vacation from  the cares of life.  A great read over and over again.,1
"I looked for this book after catching the end of the miniseries on TV. I guess the author broke a lot of ""rules"" about characters and probably other things, too, but I loved it. You might be introduced to a character, learn all about him, and find him dead two pages later. This gave me a sense for what it might have been like to live through those harrowing years. The readers, just like the aviators themselves, don't know who's going to make it through. An absolutely fascinating drama. Highly recommended!",1
"The most striking thing about this novel is the setting. The events take place within a thin layer just below the surface of a neutron star.Somehow, life is possible within this environment and the main  characters are a tiny race of beings created by humans to be able to live  in the environment.Within this world, the author creates a preindustrial  society whose attitudes bear an odd resemblance to those on the planet  Norfolk in Peter Hamilton's &quot;Night's Dawn&quot; series. Yes, despite  the setting, the characters are really taken from pastoral England. Indeed,  Baxter's heroine Dura and several of the other characters might have walked  out of a novel by Thomas Hardy.The novel follows the adventures of Dura  as she starts out trying to save her small clan and ends trying to save the  world and perhaps even the universe itself.A good story, some  interesting characters and a great setting. So, what could go wrong with  that?Well, despite all of this promise, the novel finally failed to be  complete because of the way that the ending was handled. Suddenly, new  technologies, situations and relationnships were introduced to tie up all  of the dangling threads and bring things to a conclusion. I almost had the  feeling the the author suddenly decided that it was time to get it all  wrapped up and off to the publishers.",1
"such an amazing book..interesting plot line..amazing characters..vivid, real, amazing.",1
"Before I discovered Madeleine Brent's books, my favorite author was Victoria Holt and I absolutely always said that I couldn't imagine another author ever topping her in my favorite's list but I have to admit that I was wrong, wrong, wrong!! And I am hardly ever wrong, just ask my husband!!  Anyway, you can't go wrong with any of the Madeleine Brent books and my two favorites (and it is very, very, very difficult to pick a favorite)are Merlins Keep and The Golden Urchin, the Golden Urchin being my favorite book of all time!!  How I wish Hollywood would wake up and make some movies based on these books by Madeleine Brent - I know they would become beloved classics!!  Read all of the Madeleine Brent books and you won't find better prices than those on Amazon.com  Happy reading!!!",1
"The Live Program ""Wake Up to Life"" is Powerful and Profound, the only complete Conference de Mello allowed to be recorded. This book is the written-transcript for the Live Conference, ""Wake Up to Life."" It is the only full-length de Mello Conference available -- and the only one he allowed to be recorded. It is even more powerful because you hear de Mello Live with an audience.De Mello also has three films, one is ""A Way to God for Today"". These are excellent.Many have wondered how a man from India could speak so pointedly to one's personal experience and background.One reviewer has described this quality, ""In his words and in his person there naturally flow the best currents of East and West in a holistic approach which incorporates theology, psychology, literature, and popular culture. He is an international man whose planetary perspective provides the ingredients for a newly emerging human spirituality.""Another said, ""In one day he unburdened me of years of guilt and wrong thinking. I am now living with fresh eyes and a new heart.""""He provided an atmosphere for me to experience God .  .  .  """"He has broken . . . a mystical sound barrier in our spiritual growth, that has elevated our capacities to be more loving and introspective.""",1
I just started reading this author and was looking for another in the series.  Being a UK author I was glad to find him on Amazon.  The book arrived quickly and in good shape.  Note the UK book sizes are a bit taller than US paperbacks so you may need to adjust shelf sizes.,1
"When Ephron Vestrit, head of the Vestrit trading family of Bingtown becomes the third generation of his family to die onboard his Liveship, Vivacia, the ship ""quickens"" and becomes alive. Liveships, made of wizardwood, a magical substance so valuable that the four-generation old debt of the Vestrits is still being repaid, are vital to the success of Bingetown, a city-state that has a monopoly on trade with the Rain Wilds. With Ephron dead, the fate of Vivacia and the Vestrits rests on the outcome of a family struggle between his daughter, Althea, an accomplished sailor, and Kyle Haven, her sister Keffria's husband. To Althea's surprise, her father leaves Vivacia to her sister, who promptly hands it over to Kyle. Kyle plans to restore the family's fortunes by entering the slave trade, a trade which sensitive Liveships abhor, and Althea leaves home in disgust and despair to set out on her own in an attempt to prove herself worthy of the ship she has lost.Vivacia will only sail with a blood member of her family onboard and, without Althea, Kyle must use his son, Wintrow, recently torn from his dream of the priesthood, to console the ship. Wintrow cannot decide between his hatred of the new life thrust upon him and his growing love for the ship.To the south, in the Pirate Isles, Captain Kennit dreams of uniting the pirate townships under him as self-styled pirate king. He has set about capturing slave-ships and releasing the grateful slaves, which then crew the captured vessels in a growing pirate fleet under Kennit's control. The one thing he is missing is a Liveship.Under the sea, a group of sea serpents is desperately seeking ""She Who Remembers"", to lead them somewhere unremembered for some equally important but forgotten purpose.The Liveship Trader's Trilogy takes place in Jamaillia, Bingtown and the Pirate Isles, on the coast far to the south of the Six Duchies. The war in the north has interrupted the trade that is the lifeblood of Bingtown, and the Liveship Traders have fallen on hard times despite their magic sentient ships. At one time, possession of a Liveship, constructed of magical wizard wood, guaranteed a Trader's family prosperity. Only a Liveship can brave the dangers of the Rain Wild River and trade with the legendary Rain Wild Traders and their mysterious magical goods, plundered from the enigmatic Elderling ruins. Althea Vestrit expects her families to adhere to tradition, and pass the family Liveship on to her when it quickens at the death of her father. Instead, the Vivacia goes to her sister Keffria and her scheming Chalcedean husband Kyle. The proud Liveship becomes a transport vessel for the despised but highly profitable slave trade.Althea, cast out on her own, resolves to make her own way in the world and somehow regain control of her family's living ship. Her old shipmate Brashen Trell, the enigmatic woodcarver Amber and the Paragon, the notorious mad Liveship are the only allies she can rally to her cause. Pirates, a slave rebellion, migrating sea serpents and a newly hatched dragon are but a few of the obstacles she must face on her way to discovering that Liveships are not, perhaps, what they seem to be, and may have dreams of their own to follow.",1
"Robinson's Mars Trilogy begins as admirably written hard science fiction, based for the most part on physics and geology.  As the story progresses, the plot is based more and more upon Robinson's previous suppositions than on fact - in short, he begins to extrapolate.  By the last page of the last book, we're asked to believe that human beings can postpone death almost indefinitely, have solved the problem of war, and are ready to colonize space, all in about three hundred years.  My willing suspension of disbelief wore out about two-thirds of the way through the last book.",1
"I could not put this book down!!!  Loved it.  Wonderful story, written beautifully, highly recommended.  I don't usually tell my husband about the stories I read, but I kept telling him about this one.I don't understand some of the negative reviews I've read about this book.I truly enjoyed it and wish there were more like it.",1
"Simply put, the book is long, wordy, and seems to go nowhere. Everything ends in obnoxious cliffhangers so there's no sense of closure, just frustration.Some of the characters I was most interested in (i.e. Bran) get almost no mention. I read in an interview where GRRM said that Bran's chapters were some of the hardest to write because of the magical elements... so I guess he fixed that by just not writing any.I wonder how HBO will turn this and book 4 into functioning seasons, because the events related in their combined 2000 pages don't offer much of the breakneck pacing and excitement the show is known for.",1
What a great adventure this books was.  I loved it.  I'll never look at an elephant the same way again.,1
"Good book. I liked the movie, but  I loved the book...Slow read but a good read. It had much more information",1
Another great book from Lisa Scottoline. I'm a fan of her writing and this book was excellent. Now on to my next Scottolijne book and I'm sure I won't be disappointed.,1
Follows the nicely organized previous four books in which each character's and its environment at every stage of the whole story is neatly presented. Can't wait for the next book.,1
"If you are unsure if ritual abuse is fact or fantasy, this is the book to read. Andrew Boyd is very objective in covering his research findings. Most of the alleged abuse in this book took place in the U.K..However, there is information on alleged abuse that took place in other countries (such as the U.S). At the time that I write this review, Blasphemous Rumors is out of print. Nevertheless, I suggest getting your hands on this book if you have any questions on this topic.",1
Book arrived in mint condition & delivery was very prompt!  Love the series - captivating reading.  Characters are a bit involved but there's an index to help you sort it all out.,1
"From the very first paragraph, this author grabs our attention, and awakens every sense...touch, smells, descriptions that have us see every nuance of the scene before us, as if we were standing next to the hero. Besides, she surprises us with unexpected descriptions that are raw, real and gutsy. For eg., I left there ""stiff all over.""Wonderful reading, I need to go to bed earlier so I can read more of this wonderful book, before sleep o'ertakes me.",1
"I could not put this one down.  I would get mad that I had to go to bed, or go to work.  I wanted to finish this book.  It even led me to rent some National Geographic dvds about King Henry VIII, to check out a book on Katharine of Aragon, and rent other movies based on King Henry VIII.  I love that Ms. Gregory was able to incorporate real history with the fiction of Mary.  Terrific book.",1
"Let rate each of the major plotlines in the book in true U.S. Navy fashion, of Outstanding, Excellent, Good, Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory. SPOILER ALERT -- spoilers abound.The Asia Minor war with the United Islamic Republic.  First off, I must note that Jack Ryan is not a good president.  His unpresidential conduct (e.g., maudlin funeral service) made him, and by extension his country, look weak.  Something to think about when we elect the next president.  Second, we now know that Iran taking over Iraq in a matter of days is not something that could happen.  Iran can barely control itself, let alone another country.  The land, air and sea battles were fairly well done, however.  Rating: good.Ebola terrorism.  Well done with the exception that Ding and Chavez pop up, Zelig-like, to provide crucial information about who has been experimenting with monkeys.  The retribution at the end was fantastic (JDAMs on the mullah-in-chief's house especially), and my only question is, Why not use a high-level nuclear bomb to destroy the lab, instead of a low-level one?  Rating: excellent.The assassination attempt on Jack.  The idea of a Mohammedan sleeper agent is certainly plausible, post- 9-11, post-Lackawanna Sleeper Cell.  I didn't like the fact that catching the rogue Secret Service agent depended in part on luck, but it was certainly presented in a plausible way.  Rating: excellent.The assassination attempt on SANDBOX.  I'm getting tired of ""kids in jep.""  Clancy skillfully played that card in ""Patriot Games"" but I'm a little annoyed to see it come up again here.  The only thing that saves this plotline from Unsatisfactory rating is the vivid description of the assault and the takedown of the bad guys.  Rating: satisfactory.The Mountain Men.  Didn't go anywhere and was unnecessary.  Unsatisfactory.Edward Kealty tries to muscle back into the presidency.  A little absurd but does present interesting legal issues.  Rating: good.Running the government.  Clancy obviously took the chance to tell us everything he would change if he were president, but it wound up being just a series of political speeches that any competent editor could have stopped.  Two hundred or more pages could have been taken out of the book in this part alone and it would have been far better.  Clancy needs an editor with some backbone, for his sake as well as ours.  Rating: unsatisfactory.",1
"This book was recommended to me by a few good friends and since there was a movie coming out as well, I was prompted to read it. It is the perfect book if you need a light read and to just get lost in another world for a little while. The story has great depth and imagination. It is filled with colorful emotions and characters. It is great for any reader seeking a dark, winding tale with a unique love story.",1
I loved getting to know each character and could not put the book down. This is a must read for anyone.,1
"I enjoyed reading this and loved finding out what happened to all the characters. Unfortunately I also found myself bored with reading it, unlike previous books that I couldn't put down. I wad a little disappointed with the development of some of the characters as well. Overall though it's a good read and must for fans of the series.",1
This was a wonderful story. It took you back to a world that was going through hard times but still managed to have some magic and hope. I truely enjoyed the story and think it is a great adventure to take.,1
"This is likely the last one of the series I will read. I understand that our lives often seem to be an endless circling around issues and seeking after elusive goals but, somehow, reading endless anecdotes of characters with whom we've become involved is not my idea of a great read. I wanted some resolution to the chaos of their lives--but it only happened with one: Jon Snow.",1
I felt like the elephant was almost a person.  I really enjoyed reading this book.,1
I'm a full blown anglophile and fairly picky reader of historical fiction.  I found this to be an entertaining book and one of Gregory's better efforts.  I can't wait for the movie version with Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman ... should be hot!,1
"I had almost decided to give up on this series because it has been so long since Feast for Crows came out, but then HBO did Game of Thrones and I remembered why I loved them so much.The book has some predictable flaws, the foremost of which was created by dividing the book into Feast for Crows and Dance with Dragons. If they had come out more swiftly, Martin might have gotten away with writing such an unwieldy set of books. But it is just too hard to remember who many of the characters are. You spend quite a bit of time going, who the hell is this guy?To my surprise, however, I found myself missing some of the people who I had thought I wouldn't (Brianna). And most of the time I didn't much mind if it took me a while to place characters or if I had to go look them up online.I was enjoying the journey. So Martin painted himself into some big writerly corners. Big deal. It's a complicated world he has created and I'm going to stick around until I find out the ultimate fate of Tyrion Lannister, unless I meet my own first. Which is entirely possible given how long it takes Martin to write these things.",1
"This engrossing book sucks you into its colorful world and holds you there until the 800-pound fat lady sings.Plot summary:Veterinary student Jacob joins the Benzini Bros. circus train in 1931 and falls in love with Marlena, an equestrian performer, who happens to be married to his boss the volatile animal director August.Pros:This is a must-read, page-turner featuring a unique setting for a classic love triangle. It's gripping and complex, with some wonderfully written supporting characters such as Walter, Camel, Uncle Al and Rosie the elephant. The tension slowly builds between the central characters, but is relieved with some laugh-out-loud moments from circus lore. The story is told in flashbacks from a 93 year old. There are some truly poignant moments at the nursing home. This is a really unique, well-done and entertaining book, and I liked that I couldn't guess the ending.Cons:Virtually non-existent and what there is is nitpicky, but here goes... It's written in present tense, which takes some getting used to. On p. 147: ""A black boy offers to shine my shoes.""  My 98-year-old grandmother uses the term ""colored"" and I believe that was the common term in the `30s and that ""black"" was a '60s term. Again, stupid nitpicky and doesn't detract from this fabulous book.Worth all of the hype, this is one of the best books I've read this year (and I've read a lot of books.) Read the book before you see the movie. Enthusiastically recommended. 5 stars.",1
"*SPOILERS AHEAD*I was prepared for the worst while reading this, based on some of the reviews, but it isn't as bad as people make it out to be. It's true that a 'bad' GRRM book is much better than most out there. Still, I can't help but feel disappointed that there's very little plot advancement after yet another 1,000 pages and hours of reading. The first thing the reader will notice is that the book begins about halfway through Feast for Crows and those who are dead are not and events that have happened are still to come. It can be a little disorienting at first, and a bit of a waste of time.There are three main issues I have with the book.. the first is the shock of main characters dying has worn off because, well, they don't stay dead. So anyone who dies might still come back and haunt the rest of the book. Character deaths therefore lose their punch; I keep waiting to hear about Robb leading another host. The second issue is the rush of new characters. Aegon, really? The Prince of Dorne? Are they necessary? Why do we care? And therein lies my biggest critique -- we've emotionally invested in the characters only to see to them killed off, marginalized, and/or supplanted by new ones. Tyrion is probably the most glaring example of this. He still seems to have the smarts that made him a central force through the first couple books, but here, he's a shell of himself, a caricature of himself, and half of his travels are wholly unnecessary if they did away with the Dorne subplot. And Jon........I'll finish the series if GRRM sees fit to finish it. And I recommend the book but didn't feel the need to power through with sleepless nights. Not that there's any rush, anyway.. there's no timetable on the next one, so pick your way through the world and settle in for a long ride.",1
"I agree with the reviews that praise this effort. Well written, well plotted, and much more elegant than standard high fantasy, this series just seems a cut above other fantasies in almost all departments. We reread very few books in our house, but this set is kept on the the read-again shelf with Lord of the Rings and a few others.One note. Some people love Kay's other work (like ""Sarantium"" or ""Tigana""), and don't like this. Some like this and don't like the others. Understood. (I'm in the latter category.) They are just two different kinds of books. So, if you are familiar with other Kay books, just be warned that this trilogy has an entirely different feel. (And for what it's worth, ""Ysabel"" sort of falls in between the two bodies of work.)",1
Along Came a Spider was a great read!  James Patterson's way of getting into the killer's mind is amazing!  I can't wait to read more!,1
"WARNING, this review will be semi-spoiler-y!Anywho, first reaction: WHY THE HELL WAS THIS BOOK SO LONG?I had the feeling that this one would be packed with action, unlike its predecessor, the rambling and boring A Feast for Crows. It came on the heels of A Storm of Swords, easily my favorite book in the series, but I was not prepared for its length, where absolutely nothing happens. I expected more from ADwD, especially since it took so long to write. But nope. In the vein of AFfC, it was all set-up. Which is fine, but someone needs to get GRRM a better editor, because we do not need nearly 2,000 pages of set-up. I understand it's an epic story. But really, GRRM, you're just drowning yourself and your readers.Second of all, I have a problem with all of the cliffhangers. I feel like cliffhangers that resolve NOTHING are super cheap to the reader, because we have to wait such a long time to find out what happens. It's like in TV shows where the MC dies at the end of the season and you have to wait months to find out, oh, they weren't really dead. It's cheap. A good cliffhanger should resolve most of the plot while still leaving some juicy threads. GRRM's cliffhangers are all threads. Nothing was resolved. Dany continued to be annoying in Mereen, where she hooked up with Daario only AFTER getting engaged. Jon became a good leader but then was 'killed' at the end. (Quotations because I know he is not dead. I hate that GRRM brings so many people back from the dead. I thought that, after Ned and Robb, we knew people could die. But now they either don't die or are resurrected. It's annoying.) Tyrion's chapters at least contained some character development. There were only two Arya chapters, only ONE Jaime chapter in which he was kidnapped by an obviously-alive Brienne, and a small number of Bran chapters. For so many pages, we could've gotten more of their stories and he could've cut out some of the food description.The only thing that I really loved about this book was Theon's character arc. I HATED Theon in ACoK, but I felt so bad for him as Reek and I was immensely satisfied at his final words in ADwD. Say what I will about GRRM, but he is awesome at characterization. He made me love Jaime and he made me love Theon.If only because this is an ASOIAF book, I'll give it:",1
"Jacob looks back to memories of love and his time with the circus when he was a young man.  He needs them now more than ever to get him through the declining life he lives out in a nursing home. The story portrayed a difficult, sad, evil circus environment where animals were mistreated by men who mistreated each other as well, I guess to survive the depression.  I wanted more from the story than its hopeful ending.  I wanted throughout to be lifted above its base struggles. I want more vivid descriptions of scenes and increased depth to the characters. What Jacob, like so many in nursing homes needed most was the comfort of family, friends, and staff to listen, to care. A well written book with depressing undertones.",1
"In all of Agatha Christie's 85 novels, I have managed to read two back to back that are not only very much alike, but don't follow the usual murder mystery genre.I found ""Passenger to Frankfurt"" to be very different. It follows more a genre of being international intrique. Reading it I felt like I was reading a ""Robert Ludlum"".This book follows a lot of the themes of Hitler ""fanatic-ism"" and there is even an uncovering that maybe Hitler didn't die and instead was exchanged for an imposter and lived the rest of his days in South America.There is a note in the front of this book from Agatha Christie to the reader, explaining how the novel is very much fantasy, and that is totally true. It could happen, possibly, but it seems unreal in many ways as well.It definitely hasn't been my favourite. I wasn't on the edge of my seat and everything only started making sense about 3/4 of the way through, and I'm not sure I really understood anything by the end of it.I've heard people say that before about this one.On wikipedia Robert Barnard is quoted as saying : ""Robert Barnard: ""The last of the thrillers, and one that slides from the unlikely to the inconceivable and finally lands up in incomprehensible muddle. Prizes should be offered to readers who can explain the ending.""Yes not quite the usual from Ms Christie, but I shall see what the next one I pick up has to offer.",1
"My daughter has been asking me to read this book for years.  I resisted because I read the synopsis and thought ""a story about a circus in the era of the great depression? Nah.""  I finally downloaded it and gave it a go and couldn't put the book down.  Seriously this is one of the best books I've read in years!  I felt like I was right there.  The narrative shifts back and forth between old Jacob and young Jacob seamlessly.  I strongly regret waiting so long to read this book.  And for you Nook/Kindle lovers, this book is only $5 to download.  I would have paid full price.  It is a haunting story and often had me thinking of my own aging.  What will it feel like to be inside a body that is old and doesn't function like it used to, yet the mind still feels young?  I can't wait for the movie to come out in April.",1
Can't wait until the next book. So much is happening and converging together in this world and so many unanswered questions.,1
"The strength of the book is its narrative flow. I particularly liked the little catch-words that usually connected the ""assisted living"" chapters with the circus chapters. Gruen generally wrote in such connections, and I found them both ingeniously crafted and useful in uniting the narrative.In addition to telling a great story, Gruen gives a remarkably detailed picture of the circus world of the 1930s. I had definitely never heard of a ""cooch tent"" before reading this book, for example, and Gruen's depiction of its solo practitioner is thoughtful, humane, and free of cliches. The ideas of circuses getting booted out of town, of people getting booted off the circus trains, and of entrepreneurs cannibalizing the remnants of failed circuses were also quite fascinating.To the extent that Gruen wanted to make an analogy to the biblical Jacob story by obscurely dropped hints and anagrammed names, I think, however, that she pushed too far. This novel stands nicely on its own without this type of symbolism or metaphor.",1
"I'm losing interest in many of the story lines, but there were some nuggets in this book. I still love Jon Snow. I love the dragons and the dragon queen. My desire not to see the words c&ck; or T&ats; over and over has deepened.I want more nuggets!",1
"Clancy has a talent for spinning tales with mutiple interwoven plots -- and this book will not disappoint those who have come to enjoy this style.Our hero, Jack Ryan, now finds himself promoted to the very top position in the United States government -- the presidency. A job he didn't want, circumstances have placed him in the excutive office with a full two thirds of the government apparatis demolished via a terrorist act.To add to his woe, middle eastern agents have introduced biological warfare into the country -- and one of the secret service men guarding him is a sleeper agent waiting for the proper moment to execute him.In true Clancy style all these things develop simultaneously and provide an interesting (if rather longish) story. I find it particularly interesting to note that much of the action seems to mirror the real world September 11th terrorist acts (the book was released a couple of years prior to this event). Could it be that the novel was used as a blueprint by real world terrorists or at least provided them the idea? It's an interesting theory. Read the story and make your own determination.Bottom line is this is an important installment in the ongoing adventures of the (now) legendary Jack Ryan -- one you will want to read and add to the collection. The tale will keep you up late waiting to see how Jack copes with the developing situations though the outcome is never really in doubt.** Recommended **~P~",1
I have read this book so many times I have lost count. If you want backstory with real characterization this is the one Clancy you must read.,1
I thoroughly enjoyed every word of this book.  I was actually quite disappointed when I reached the end.  I recommend this book to everyone I know!Water for Elephants: A Novel,1
Awesome excellent reading. Well written James continues at his usual interest holding capabilities once again you won't be disappointed.,1
"I caught a review of this book on NPR.I usually am disappointed in books by female authors, but the only thing that bothered me about this book was that it ended. I will keep a more open mind henceforth. I haven't seen the other reviews but can't see how anyone could give this title less than a four. I enjoyed it from start to finish.Am now going to see which of Ms. Gruen's books I want to read next.Well done!",1
"Neville Asgarth is the son of a draper who has overcome his lower class origins to rise up the corporate ladder of the Church of England.  He has a deeply troubled psyche and is my least favorite character in Howatch's six book series.Not without an innate ability as a clergyman, Neville also has the remarkable luck to marry a woman above his social station who is too good and too kind for him.  He finds her tedious.  And when she dies, worn out and under-appreciated after giving birth to Neville's five children, Neville feels liberated to pursue the society ""It"" girl, Dido Tallent, a glossy, fluffy flirt who sets her cap for the seemingly stable, mentally integrated, charming clergyman-on-the-rise because she fancies playing ""Bishop's Wife"" on the social scene.  After a prolonged courtship, Neville finally wins his prize, and Dido becomes his wife.The book deals with Neville's unresolved antipathy to his uncle, his conflicts of social class, his guilt over his treatment of his first wife and the guilt inherent in her death, his obsessive nature as evidenced by his single-minded pursuit of Dido, and his ability to compartmentalize aspects of his psyche into multiple personalities.  This guy has issues.SPOILER ALERT: Ultimately his exhaustive pursuit and subsequent winning of Dido come back to haunt him.  The pursuit was everything; the having nothing.  He quickly loses interest in her and, worse, it becomes apparent in subsequent books of the series that Dido morphs into a regular horror, one of those people with an uncanny intuition coupled with a brutal candor that leaves her victims positively skewered emotionally and psychologically.  We've all known people like that, people whose verbal bludgeoning is qualified by the pious phrase,""I'm only speaking the truth.""  In addition, Dido is so highly strung that she is subject to episodes where she can't function at all, and she is disgusted by the sex act whereas Neville is very much a sexual being.At any rate, divorce is out of the question as it would ruin Asgarth's hard-won career, so he is stuck with Dido and as book four, ""Scandalous Risks,"" serves to point out, it couldn't happen to a nicer guy....Howatch's Church of England series is a beautifully crafted, deeply pithy look at human nature with all its warts as well as a thorough examination of theological rationale.  Truly, if you're at all bent in an intellectual direction, you will devour these books.",1
"If your a Flashman  junkie, the book is just the thing .The  likeable coward takes you through more of his mishaps with  unbelievable results only G. Fraser can pull off.All the characters are flawed, ,just as life is flawed.Fun reading.Did Flashman father Errol Flynn?",1
"This is an excellent source of history.  Well written and engrossing.  I think it is important that you read the entire series, and best in order, started with Master and Commander.  Also an excellent series for books on tape.",1
"Any Clancy reader knows all about John Clark and &#34;stone cold killer&#34;, describes him best.  Now we find out why he's like he is.  Great read, makes you want to get right in there with him.  Clancy at his best!",1
"Water for Elephants has it all- adventure, drama, romance, history, and the circus! What more can you ask? Seriously, read this book.",1
"I really enjoyed this book. Not too much I can say about it without spoilers, but it was definitely my second favorite of the series, right after A Storm of Swords.",1
"Cat Among the Pigeons is constructed a bit differently than most of Agatha Christie's novels; rather than a single primary setting where most if not all the action takes place, with Hercule Poirot entering fairly early in the story, this book veers back and forth between times and settings.  It starts at Meadowbank, a very exclusive English girl's school.  Then it reverses in time by a few months and moves to the fictional Middle Eastern country (or city?) of Ramat, where the crown prince entrusts his close English friend with his most prized possession, not sure if he will make it out of his country alive due to the revolution that is taking place.  Then the setting moves back to the English school again, where we are told very early on that the handsome new young gardner is really a special forces agent working under disguise.The point of view often shifts, also, between the various characters and sometimes information is given via a ""newspaper article"" or a letter.It is not until near the end (disc 5 of 6) that Hercule Poirot even enters the story, when one of the students at the girls' school goes to him after two murders have occurred at the school and after she had made an astounding discovery.  Poirot remains a minor character whose sole role was his characteristic ""summing up"" at the end of the book where he always summons all of the characters into a room together and proceeds to tell them the solution to the mystery giving his step-by-step process.  Which was very unlikely in this case, since his lack of involvement meant he had to make astounding leaps of deduction which were quite unconvincing.This makes for a very disjointed novel and weakens Cat Among the Pigeons significantly.  Which is a shame because, as far as characterizations go, it is one of Christie's best, with none of the silly characterizations or gimmicky plot elements that she sometimes put in her other books.  As one other reviewer stated (much more articulately than I can), it is as though with this book Agatha Christie couldn't settle on exactly what type of mystery she wanted to write.As usual, Hugh Fraser's narration is excellent.",1
Wouk does a magnificent job of providing the background of the US prior to our comittment in World War Two.,1
"Another bombshell by the master... Tracy Whitney is the woman we all wanna be, getting away with all the daring things we try to do.",1
"I agree with the others that this series as a whole is just amazingly good.  Granted, it's also amazingly brutal, which can make it hard to recommend to friends, but it's one of the best sci-fi series I've ever read.  And the ending is just unbelievably good.  I started reading the series around the time the 3rd book came out, and waiting for the remaining two to be published was hard.  I read this book 12 years ago, so I don't really remember many of the details, but the simple fact that I still remember how amazingly good the series was (and particularly the ending) should speak volumes.",1
"Loved this book. Though the ending is telegraphed ahead of the final chapter, the book is satisfying and fun.I played in a circus band when I was a teenager and am delighted by the author's accurate feel for circuses and descriptions of circus folks and traditions.Sara Gruen writes well. The story is solid. A very good book.",1
"Excellent old fashioned story telling at it's best! I enjoyed every minute of this book, from the first page. Gives you a peek into a life one rarely gets the chance to see or understand. The characters are very well developed and so very vulnerable and real. I kept forgetting this was a work of fiction. If you love a good bedtime story, this is for you. Real, raw human reality, quirky and FUN.",1
Not lord of the rings good or 1st time you read Foundation good but very very good. Lots of detail in the science background to convince,1
"For Whom the Bell Tolls is a great book with large themes: war, love, devotion to duty, and the clash between modern, rational values and more traditional ones.  At a higher level, it is about connections between people: indeed, the book opens with the following quotation from John Donne:. . . any mans death diminishes me, because I am involved in Mankinde; And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.Hemingway takes us inside a guerilla band during the Spanish Civil War, mostly through the eyes of Robert Jordan, an American professor-cum-demolitions expert.  Jordan is a Communist - at least he is strongly drawn to Communism - who has come to Spain to fight fascism.  He has character and a sense of duty.  Since, from our vantage point, at the beginning of the 21st century, it seems that not many people do, this gives the book a kind of ""long ago and far away"" feel.  Readers in 1940, when the book was published, no doubt experienced it in a more immediate way.This book includes many memorable secondary characters: among them Pilar, the wise leader of the band of partisans, Pablo, her drunken, amoral, but capable husband, and Maria, the love interest in the story.Like every Hemingway novel that I've read, this one is well written.  Hemingway uses the archaic English ""thou"" for the Spanish ""tu"" and translates literally from Spanish to English to better convey an impression of Spanish dialogue to English readers.  These devices are initially distracting but are actually very successful at taking the reader inside the minds of the Spanish-speaking characters in this book.This is a distinguished work and an exciting one.  It deserves its acclaim.",1
"Its a thin book, very readable and has interesting 1-2 page thoughts on various entities like anger, children, religion, speech, silence and its COOL.........reading. Ofcourse if one needs to imbibe the thoughts of the  author, it has to be consumed slowly and perhaps revisited but leaves you  pretty heady and clear about certain things.",1
"I have read a dozen historical novels about Queen Elizabeth I, and this one is by far the best.Comprehensively researched, richly detailed and written in an exciting and vibrant manner, there is not an aspect of Elizabeth's life that the author does not touch on.From her childhood trauma at the execution of her mother when she was three and Elizabeth being branded as a 'bastard' through to her precarious hold onto her life while she came under danger during the reigns of her father, brother and sister.Wonderful examination of her  sexual exploitation by her stepfather Sir Thomas Seymour, how she escaped death under the reign of her elder half-sister Bloody Mary, as illustrated by her carving of the words ""Much suspected by me, Nothing proved can be, Quoth Elizabeth prisoner"" into a window at Woodstock Manor.The book well illustrates what shaped Elizabeth into the cunning and wily, and vain but not unmerciful ruler.It explores her deep love for Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, her life soul mate,of whom even he, she would not marry, determined to share her throne with no one. also her fascination and adoration of the vain and foolish young Earl of Leicester who she was forced to have executed after his attempts to depose her.Her religious convictions are shown to be of expedience. she would choose the faith her subjects wanted England to be governed by, which was why she was a Protestant in a fervently Protestant England, reeling from the horrors of Mary I's attempt to transfer the Spanish Inquisition to England.The book is sympathetic to Elizabeth, nothing like Philippa Gregory's vilification of her, but at the same time does not gloss over her faults.It portrays her great guilt at the execution of Mary queen of Scots and her finest hour in rallying England to defend her shores and win the great victory against the Spanish Armada that threatened her realm and the freedom of her people-the Spanish ships carried devices of torture designed to bring all of the horrors of the Inquisition to England.Great characterization, realistic and yet fascinating and gripping . True to form of one of Jean Plaidy- who with 50 intriguing title to her name, remains one of the greatest historical novelists of English historyWell worth the time and effort.",1
Awesome cant say enough about this series if your a fan this is a must read so many twists now the wait for six,1
"I have read a lot of fantasy in my time and it is rare to come across a story that is truly original. The world Robin Hobb has created in this series is unlike any I've seen, the magic is subtle and the characters are alive. After reading the Farseer trilogy (also by Robin Hobb), I couldn't wait to get my hands on more of her books. This one was as good. The characters Robin creates are real people, they don't always behave the way you expect them to, they make mistakes and they evolve based on what has happened to them. None of the characters are completely good or completely evil, and they don't fit into classic stereotypes.This series is actually placed in the same world as the Farseer trilogy and there are a few subtle ties to that story (which is fun if you've read it). If you find you like Robin Hobb's style, you should really consider listening to her works in order. Each trilogy stands alone, but is made better if read in the right order. Start with the Farseer trilogy, next is the Liveship Traders, then the Tawny Man, and finally the Rainwild chronicles. If on the other hand, you are only going to read one set...this one stands alone the best. It is impossible to stop reading until you've reached the end.",1
"I love getting books online.  The price is comparable to what I can get at the local store and I didn't have to get out. The book itself was okay, not up to the first 3 though.  Anxious for the 6th to come out just to see how in the world R.R Martin can bring this story to an end.",1
"Celia Ravenscroft is but a little girl when both her parents commit suicide. Never did she worry about the real reasons for that dramatic event, until today when she stands on the verge of getting married to Desmond Burton-Cox. Only one question suddenly seems of importance: Who killed whom, Celia's father or mother? Reason enough for Ariadne Oliver, Celia's godmother, to pay a visit to her old friend Hercule Poirot. The famous sleuth persuades Mrs. Oliver to delve -with his guidance, of course- into the past, to find the persons who are like elephants, the persons who will still remember the important details about this all-but-forgotten tragedy.Elephants Can Remember is Agatha Christie's next to last work of detection and the author shows clearly signs of age, which is understandable since she was eighty-two years old and in failing health.Elephants Can Remember is a ""murder in retrospect"" mystery. Although Christie has proven to fully master this format -see Sparkling Cyanide and Five Little Pigs- she now quickly looses touch with the story. She is forced to sow the narrative together with vague memories of a series of old spinsters and suddenly even events that should easily be remembered are covered by the veil of forgetfulness. No surprise that the plot is total confusion. It is less a mystery than a scrapbook of memories. Action is less important than atmosphere, which makes the story quite tedious and difficult to hang on to. Nevertheless, the experienced reader will figure out the solution to this not too mysterious mystery halfway through the book.",1
"Good book.  I can't wait to see where he will go with the next book. This book had more character development similar to the last book.  You definitely cannot get attached to any one character, that's the kiss of death.",1
"In the sixteenth century, the border between Scotland and England was the much fought-over scene of frequent warfare between the two kingdoms.  The families on both sides fell into an armed, semi-nomadic existence whose economic mainspring was raiding the other side for cattle, property, and slaves.  In ""The Steel Bonnets"", accomplished journalist, novelist, and historian George MacDonald Fraser takes on the challenging task of making sense of the Anglo-Scottish border reivers, as these raiders were called.  Proof of his success may lie in the fact that ""The Steel Bonnets"" has never been out of print since first publication in 1971.In his characteristic animated prose, Fraser lays out the background of the border area, identifies its people, and describes their distinctive lifestyle.  His narrative is commendably even-handed.  If violence, robbery, and chicanery was a way of life for the reivers, he provides the necessary context.  In a land without law, armed force was a necessity for survival.  The long conflict between border families, and with the uncertain law enforcement of the border districts, has many layers.  Fraser does his best to make sense of it all.  He makes liberal use of colorful anecdotes to move the narrative along and to characterize a complicated history.With the union of the English and Scottish crowns in 1603, the shelter of the border went away; the reivers were scourged out of existence in just ten years by a ruthless application of hanging justice.  Fraser notes the similarities of the Anglo-Scottish border in its lawless heyday with the present-day frontiers of Pakistan and Afghanistan; those responsible for pacifying that bloody border may find here some useful lessons.  ""The Steel Bonnets"" is very recommended as a superb example of well-written history.",1
Love cookbooks with pictures so I know how the finished product will turn out.  The combinations of herbs with vegetables and meats makes for good cooking and eating.,1
"I loved this book. Regardless of what others have said about the authors writing, she did fabulous. Great story line, great characters. A little graphic is some scenes but wonderfully written. Can't wait to watch the movie even though I know it won't be as good.",1
"Good book, pleasant read with some sad parts.  I would read it again.  The life of a cut circus performer\worker is pretty entertaining.",1
"Water for Elephants came highly recommended from several friends but it fell a little short of great.  The writing is good, but the love story is a little lacking.  In my opinion, Jacob and Marlena did not have enough scenes together for me to truly believe that they were falling in love.  I know the title is ""Water for Elephants,"" but there was a little too much about the animals in this book and not enough about the people.  I know it was about the circus but I guess I'm the type who likes a better-developed love story if I'm going to ""buy"" it.  I don't want it to sound like I disliked this book.  I didn't.  It just wasn't a story that blew me away.  It's a nice enough read for people who like sweet, well-written books.",1
"First, the obvious. Martin takes way too much time to write these books. By the time the next one comes, I've completely forgotten everything but the major plot points. It takes about half of the book to start remembering who is who and what is what. A Song of Ice and Fire is just too dark of a series to go back and reread the first four books to get back up to (slow) speed.Martin spends lots of time in this book making characters do precisely nothing. Yes, it's well written, yes it does keep you mostly interested, but by the end of the book, you wonder why you read it. Nobody progressed much of anything with regards to the story.The worst part is that at least one really cool thing does happen -- finally. But then near the end of the book, Martin pretty much takes it all back again signalling that it will have to re-happen sometime in a far future book. The one word I would use to describe this book is frustrating.ASoIaF is a must read, but it's also amazingly difficult to do so.",1
"Look, there are lots of jaded people leaving poopy reviews for A Dance with Dragons. That's their right. But George R.R. Martin has written five incredible books with some of the most engrossing, fascinating and despicable characters ever created. His villains are the vilest. His heros and heroines often get murdered. You grow to care about what happens next to a character and the character meets some foul end. Others persevere despite the fact they probably don't deserve to draw another breath.I strongly recommend you buy the whole series. You'll finish it and you'll care about the story. You'll care because it's a well crafted tale of magnificent scope and spellbinding detail. I have no idea what tool the guy is using to keep track of everything but that in and of itself must be a nightmare to manage. Martin must live in the dwarf's head and have a bird's eye view down into Cersei's oft exposed nether regions. This is certainly not The Hobbit. The Song of Ice and Fire contains a great deal of sexual content so it's for mature audiences although personally the slavery and constant murderous schemes should be more troubling than the lechery.Want engrossing characters? Got it. Want family feuds that end in mass murders and open war? Got it. Want undead zombie hordes threatening to overwhelm the realm? Got it! Martin has packed a little something in for everyone. If you like your high fantasy without any salubrious glossing over of the wretched realities of living under petty kings then A Song of Fire and Ice is a great series. Yes, Book Five fails to resolve many disputed issues. Yes, Book Five leaves the reader without a clear idea of who will rule in Westeros. That's fine, you'll want to buy Book Six. Worth every penny.",1
Amazing book and tv series. This book is a little bit review but also gets into what else will happen after where the series ended last season. I look forward to the next book(s) and to see how this all turns out. Who will end up ruling from the iron throne? I am rooting for the Mother of Dragons. I bought the hardback and it is BIG.,1
One of the two best books (fiction) ever written on WWII. The other being War and Remembrance. Mr. Wouk is one of the great writers of our time.,1
"I enjoy historical fiction and Philippa Gregory is a master storyteller.  I have purchased almost every book she has written and both my children read her books as well.  just remember, this is a novel, not non-fiction!",1
I couldn't put this down and have reccomended it to several friends. I think it's well written and extremely entertaining. I was drawn into the hypnosis scenes and facinated how all the counterparts came together in the present day. Definetly a good read!,1
"Water For Elephants grabbed me from the beginning and kept me captivated through its entirety.  I had a difficult time putting it down.  It was well-written, entertaining, and made me laugh and cry.  I highly recommend it.",1
"As a novice reader, beginning Herman Wouk's massive epic ""Winds of War"" was a big challenge for me.  It sat on my bookshelf for a while before I cracked the first page and was pleasantly surprised by its ability to keep me utterly engrossed in the story.As a historical fiction piece, Wouk tells the story of a Navy family and their individual lives leading up to the United States' entry into World War II.  As the family of five spreads out around the world, their paths continue to cross, keeping their relationships alive and continually gravitating towards one another.Truly an epic tale, Wouk does a magnificent job depicting (in an interesting manner) the historical events, political persuasion, national influence, and social pressures surrounding WWII.  You will learn about Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini, Churchill and Roosevelt... Wouk's work is better than any history class I've ever taken.This is an impactful ""must read"" for everyone and at the risk of sounding trite, I would call this book a masterpiece.Have fun,David TobiasRedondo Beach, CA",1
"GRR Martin continues the Westeros saga in this 5th installment (out of an estimated 7).  Book number 6 is expected in March 2013, and I for one can hardly wait for it.  For fantasy fans and Martin readers, ""A Dance with Dragons"" is more of the same great stuff that makes his work so addictive!",1
"Sex and intrigue in 16th Century England. What could be better?I work the local Renaissance Faire and have been interested in the Renaissance and Elizabethan period for years. This book brought to life people I had only read about in dry school texts. Ms. Gregory was able to pull me in to the lives of those at court with their gossip, lies, and scandals.Henry VIII and Anne Bolyn seemed made for each other, both so full of ambition--blind ambition. It's amazing the pressure a country and those closest to you can produce when the throne is on the line. I wouldn't want to be them, but to hear their story in this work of fiction based on history was fascinating.",1
The book was a very good story but very confusing at times she is a very good author but it was just a little too much at times d.cordano at charter.net that is it,1
"Agatha Christie's works have always been my favorites, and it was interesting to read her life story (or the stories she chose to include).  Christie's enchanting writing style and descriptive narratives drew me in right away.  Her self awareness is profound.  Great book.",1
"I like this entire series.....I am only disappointed that I have to wait for the sixth book to come out. I thought, initially, it was a 4 book series and when I finished I was stunned to realize it wasn't finished! So, I purchased book 5 anticipating the finale! Wrong again!!! It is very difficult to read a series and have to wait so long for the last(?) book to be published. Readers who have been following this Game of Thrones would like an conclusion, not to be strung along for years and years waiting for the end. Unfortunately, what sometimes happen is that we lose interest and never finish because it is too long between books. Just sayin'.  At least that's how I feel! I have become &#34;attached&#34; to some of these characters and feel terrible when they are eliminated and thrilled when they succeed. Let's get book 6 out asap and get this Game finished. Thanks for a terrific ride so far!",1
I read this book when it first came out and completely enjoyed it.. Fast paced.. Endearing characters.. Interesting all the way around.. This was just a wonderful book..Sit back and enjoy :)Emily P.,1
"I really liked this book.  The first chapter I was not sure, but kept my interest.  I would have given ti 5 stars but I thought it was too short.",1
"Having read so many of Christie's works, I was surprised I had missed this one. True to Christie style, the reader is captivated at the onset and remains so, seeking the resolution to the uncertainly of the tale, until the final page.",1
I bought this at the same time as the Romertopt book and was glad I did. It added to the variety of recipes and I tried several with great success!,1
"This view inside the life of  people in a traveling circus is not like anything I have ever read before.  Since a friend told me it was her favorite book, I decide to step outside my mystery craving and try it.  While some of the situations are a stretch, the character development and especially the relationships were worth the read.  It tends toward darkness at times, so if that bothers you, this isn't the book for you.  If not, you might enjoy it.",1
"Was an awsome book , best I've read would suggest it to all my friends, Diffrent than I have read but very ,very good",1
"Ever page held u right there waiting to see what next was going to happen in the day of a circus Plus a love story It had u wanting to watch the movie which I will be doing as soon as possible I really like the ending , better then dying in a old age place",1
I gave this book 3 starts because it was really good in the beginning and great at the end.  The only problem is that the middle just seemed to drag on forever.  I think some of the middle could have been eliminated and still achieved the same purpose.,1
"I thought this topic would be very interesting, as you get to see the inner workings of a Circus. That's something I'd never read about and DID find interesting, and it's probably what kept me reading all the way to the end.The characters however were not that well developed, especially Marlena. Most of the time she comes off as an airheaded child, a woman easily fooled and manipulated. It's also sort of difficult to really imagine Jacob and Marlena being so completely in love, as they don't really have anything in common other than their love of animals. Also not a big fan of the book flashing back and forth between 22 year old Jacob and 91 year old Jacob. Most of the ""old Jacob"" chapters are tedious to read and the payoff at the end with him is pretty small--especially as you aren't really sure how he got to be so grumpy and bitter.The main thing I disliked about this book is that it gives away the ending in the first chapter. You know the bad guy is going to die from page 1. So the rest of the book has you feeling pretty indifferent because you already know what the outcome will be. You already know the hero prevails and the tension or the thrill of finding out what will happen is gone.",1
"In her list of books, Barbara Erskine has mastered the art of using an item, a place or a person as a catalyst for a journey between the present time and the past.  In this title, a Celtic stone cross in the Scottish  highlands is the portal through which fourteen year old Adam meets Brid, a  girl from sixth century who is training as a Druid priestess.  But just as  Adam can enter the sixth century, Brid can enter the 20th, and there a 50  year nightmare begins for Adam and his loved ones.This is quite  different from Barbara Erskine's other books, which basically follow the  theme of a fairly normal modern day person finding themselves transported  to another time. Here a dark entity comes into this time. 'On the Edge of  Darkness' explores some rather disturbing emotional problems.  Adam's  father is such a complete religious fanatic he drives away his wife, and  his son lives a sad, lonely and emotionally battered life. Brid forms such  an obsessive attachment to Adam that her jealousy knows no bounds. The  emotional void in which this leaves Adam's wife is dreadful.If you are  a fan of stories of the past and present colliding, which I certainly am,  you could do a lot worse than reading this book.  On the way, you will get  to explore some dark areas of the human pysche - areas I would rather read  about than live through.",1
"The COLLINS GEM LATIN DICTIONARY is a superb little dictionary that is superior to even other language dictionaries in the Collins Gem series. It is both a Latin - English and English - Latin dictionary, and includes several appendices on terminology of Roman cultural matters.The Latin-English portion contains nearly all words the high school student or undergrad are likely to come across. It is followed by a brief summary of Latin grammar and verse. The grammar is sufficient only for students of the most basic level of competency in Latin, but the explanation of verse is insightful and will satisfy even higher-level students. The appendix of place-names in Latin and their equivalents in English is a godsend for students who can handle texts just fine except for place-names which are missing from many larger resources.One caveat is that the dictionary seems a little too large if one is not going to be using the English - Latin section. High school students, and university students taking a course in Latin composition will find this section most helpful. Those whose use of a Latin dictionary is limited to deciphering problematic words in an otherwise clearly readable text will find an entire half of the dictionary to be unnecessary and may resent the larger size of what could be an ideally compact dictionary.For beginning students of Latin, the COLLINS GEM LATIN DICTIONARY is the dictionary to get. It is not ideal for higher level study, but students with a few years of experience should have already invested in a copy of LEWIS &amp; SHORT'S LATIN DICTIONARY.",1
This book was absolutely wonderful!  Sara Gruen is an amazing writer and the story is wonderful.  I could hardly put it down once I started and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great read.,1
"I like this book, it is a fine addition to the Aubrey/Maturin Novels. I have read all the books in sequence, and have enjoyed them all.",1
"I've given it five stars because it is easy to see the amount of work that went into it.  I'd recommend this book to anyone into the fantasy genre. Logic might dictate that fans of the show would love the books, but I've known more than one fan who can't be bothered to read.I can't wait for the next one!",1
"I read both the first and second series when I was a teenager.  I enjoyed all six books very much. I loved the fantasy creatures, especially the Giants. I have just decided to re-read the entire series, now that the last set of books is complete.I found the story gripping and entertaining. I particularly like the symbolic way that Thomas and The Land are actually the same thing. As leprosy weakens Thomas's body, and insanity creeps into his mind, so goes the fate of The Land. Good series, worth reading if you like fantasy.",1
"Get your tissue ready, and be ready for intense feelings!  I read this book MANY years ago, before the hype and reread it again with my book club.  It was worth a second read, so to have this book as your own is worth it!  There is mystery, magic, and injustice.  The charcters are strongly built, and the scenery is vivid.  If you are looking for more books like this one...check out The Dirty Parts of the Bible.  You won't be disappointed either.",1
"Unlike quite a few of the reviewers before me, I found this book quite entertaining and a good read. While it might not be entirely historically correct, Gregory still manages to capture the essence of the English court and the games played in order to pursue power. She also divulges into a very intense sister rivalry, a rivalry that is unparalleled in history. I think these two points were Gregory's primary goals in the retelling of the story of Anne and Mary, not to give an accurate historical account of Anne Boleyn and King Henry VIII.If you are looking for the perfect history of King Henry VIII and his most infamous wife, Anne Boleyn, then go buy a history book. If you are looking for an entertaining, fast-paced historical novel that captures the spirit of the 16th century English court I would highly recommend The Other Boleyn Girl.",1
"This is a wonderful story! It is all at once funny, heart-breaking, and thought-provoking. I found myself so absorbed in the story that when I had to stop reading in the course of a day I was disoriented for a few minutes before I could deal with my real life. That, to me, is a sign of a great book. I loved how seamlessly the narrative moved between Jacob as an old man of ninety, or ninety-three, and the young Jacob especially. There were no odd stops and starts and no chunks of time missing between past and present. And the end had me flipping back to the beginning to see if I read it right the first time (but in a good way)! Absolutely wonderful!!",1
"Probably the most astonishing item in this book comes from the author's interview with Babette (Willi Muenzenberg's wife) at the age of 91.  She was by no means senile; she was ancient, but in top form.  She had long ago abandoned Communism and become a sharp critic of that murderous ideology.  But she knew where the corpses were buried.  When our author asked her, ""But what about Sacco and Vanzetti?"", she just gave him a little smile and said, ""That was Willi's idea.""What?!?!  How could that possibly be true?The explanation lies in this book, which will really make you dizzy as you recognize the items of Soviet disinformation one at a time.  It finally turns into a case of ""wheels within wheels,"" where the dedicated enemies Hitler and Stalin nevertheless wind up cooperating with one another in a sort of Satanic waltz.  For example: Hitler wanted to eliminate a large number of German Communists.  No problem, said Stalin, and provided him with a list of German Communists that Stalin wanted dead.If you read this book, you will suddenly come to a very different understanding of historical reality.  For example, if you read that Felix Frankfurter and Lincoln Steffens both loudly and publicly deplored the execution of Sacco and Vanzetti, you will understand why.This is an extremely valuable book which belongs on the shelf of anyone interested in the history of the twentieth century.",1

"I saw the D VD of one season of Dalziel and Pascoe, liked it a lot and got this book from my local library to see if I would like the novels as much as the show.  I was so pleased with this book that I ordered a copy to keep from Amazon.  I wish I could afford all of the late Mr. Hill's books, but will have to settle for getting most of them from the library unless finances improve.The Yorkshire setting, dialog and the main characters are a real treat = Fat Andy Detective Chief Inspector Dalziel, rude, crude and shrewd; Peter Pascoe, university educated and smooth (getting married to his rather formidable wife in this book) and craigy faced Sgt. Wield the quiet organized force in the background.  This particular book has a great beginning as Dalziel gets lost due to flooded roads when he goes south to Pascoe's wedding and finds himself witness to a very strange funeral with the coffin  being rowed through the flooded area.  His car gets stuck and he becomes a guest of the house in mourning.  It is a really odd lot of characters and plot.  I now am committed to reading the whole lot of Mr. Hill's books and being very sorry to hear that he died several years ago.Another of my favorites in the series so far is THE WOOD BEYOND which involves our basic characters and ties them to past murder and the execution of Pascoe's great grandfather during WWI.",1
"I have to confess that out of all the narrators in the Starbridge series,  Asygarth is the one who I take to the least, and Jon Darrow and Charles  Ashworth being the ones who I support the most. I think that says more  about my theological stance and my belief in Absolute Truths more than  anything else, but it is also due to the fact that Asygarths unwillingness  to face facts causes damage to himself and others, both emotionally and  spiritually in his quest for the Ultimate Prizes. For this is the backbone  of the novel. Archdeacon Asygarth, a liberal, and yet a comappsionate and  admirable believer (In fact this is where I hold him in high esteem) in  Christs grace and atonement despite whatever upset, goes for the 'Prizes'  the wordly type things that he believes will make him happy, which will  'rescue' him from his troubled childhood. 'Ultimate Prizes' shows how this  came to a head and how Jon Darrow helped him fully realise his vocation  (not just a priestly one) and also his need for vulnerability before Christ",1
"It is really amazing how prolific Agatha Christie was without repeating herself.  The woman was a much underrated genius at murder mysteries.This book has a very interesting twist at the end that really smacks you like cold water in the face.  I had read this one before, many years ago, so I knew something was coming but couldn't remember the details.  It still was a surprise.You can't go wrong reading Christie, and this book is no exception.  It isn't one of her better known titles, and of course, has no Miss Marple or Hercule Poirot, but sometimes those books are among her best.I recommend it.",1
I like the ideas.  I like the characters.  But did I mention that it was really long?  I think that if you really studied this book you could create an entire 3 dimensional model of mars.  Mr. Robinson describes nearly every peeble and crevise on the planet as if he spent 16 years there wandering the barren wastes.The bottom line is - clip 200 pages of scenery description out and it would get 4 stars.  I would have never finished this book if I was reading it in book form.  I did it on tape and it took me about 3 weeks.,1
"The Other Boleyn Girl tells the story of Mary Boleyn, sister to the infamous Anne Boleyn, second wife of Henry VIII. Mary becomes caught up in a series of political intrigues, as her family plots to become more powerful, especially against the Seymour family. Mary gives birth to Henry's child; in the meantime, Anne swoops in to take her place as Henry's mistress.Serving as backdrop is Henry VIII's court in the 16th century, where Henry and Katherine of Aragon's marriage is coming to an end. Tired of Katherine for not being able to produce a male heir, Henry breaks away from the Catholic Church in England and starts his own, so that he may divorce his wife. Philippa Gregory describes all of this in startling detail, as we watch Anne and Mary Boleyn vie for the King's affection. Power and status is what drives everybody involved. Its a fascinating look into life at court under the reign of Henry VIII.We get to see what Anne Boleyn was really like. Of course, we've heard stories, but I was amazed to see just what kinds of things she could do. Mary was the best kind of narrator for this novel, as we got to see firsthand the court and its going-ons. We often see Katherine of Aragon depicted in the history books as the frumpy, housfrou; here she becomes a real, genuine, loyal woman, who wouldn't give up her religion, no matter how much she loved her husband. That spoke of real character and courage on her part.The book takes us up to Anne's beheading. Again dissatisfied with the fact that he does not have a male heir, Henry trumps up charges of adultery against Anne. The ending is frightening, an account of what such a gruesome moment might have been like. It is said that, when the executioner lifted up Anne's head afterwards, the mouth moved. Gregory uses exquisite details to describe this event, and many others throughout the book.I've read many other works on historical fiction, and none other compares to The Other Boleyn Girl. It is very definitely a book worth reading.",1
"Written from an American's perspective this book was one of the most shocking exposes of the dreadful, Soviet communist system that killed millions of its own people from its inception in 1917. Dolgun shares from his heart and is brutally honest about everything that he did and that was done to him. I couldn't put this book down, and though it is long with small print, I will read it again and again to remind myself of the power of the human spirit combined with God's mercy can sustain a man in the most treacherous circumstances. This story is not for the faint of heart...it will break your heart but also encourage you to never give up, no matter how bleak life may be. AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME!",1
"This novel is a great read-- I found it impossible to put down, from the very beginning. The characters are wonderful, and the sub-plots involving Walter (the dwarf) and the main character really make the whole story exciting. I honestly could not tell how the book was going to end until the last dozen pages, even though the first chapter contains quite a bit of foreshadowing-- I was still second-guessing my assumptions until the very end. I didn't know what was going to happen to the characters that I loved, or if there was going to be a happy ending, or whether it would be sad. I just wasn't sure.I love it when great books keep me guessing. Absolutely one of the best books I've read all year.",1
"The last novel I read and reviewed was also about animals but this could not be more different and after struggling to get into the last one, I loved this from the minute I picked it up and found it to be an exceptional read. The authors love of animals and the tremendous research she did for this novel make it not only a fascinating portrayal of life, ugly and vibrant in the American circus of the 1930's but a beautiful and tender love story. I had never even heard of circus trains until I read this either and learning a little something when I read also appeals to me.The title had been on my wishlist for awhile so I was delighted to obtain a copy recently and wanted to get on with reading so that I can see the film, which has been recommended to me.Since seeing elephants up close in Thailand, I also have more understanding of just how intelligent they are. Wonderful creatures which will treat humans well if they are given the respect they deserve. Sara Gruen portrays the nature of the elephant perfectly, for me Rosie was the real protagonist of the novel. The novel is told as two separate but connected stories, as well as being immersed in the circus world, we are also given an inside view of a home for the elderly where the hero of the story Jacob is now living. Again the author has done her research as the scenes in the nursing home were poignant and all too familiar to me in many ways.When the novel starts Jacob Jankowski is in his nineties and living in a nursing home and the imminent arrival of the circus in town revives some very stirring memories for the old man and it is these that are told in the other storyline.It is the American Depression and when Jacob's parents die while he is studying veterinary science at university, he discovers that they were in dire financial difficulties and he cannot even afford to complete his studies. Confused and bewildered with no plans for his future he finds himself hitching a ride on a circus train and in that moment his whole life changes. By the following morning he finds himself working for the travelling circus and by that evening he has met and fallen for the woman who will for evermore be the love of his life. Marlena, the star performer, however the love should remain unrequited as she is married to August the strangely mad animal trainer. Of course it is not long either before he also meets my particular favourite, Rosie the elephant. Whilst struggling to survive in the world of this second rate travelling circus this young couples love overcomes obstacles that you can not begin to imagine.The two stories are ultimately woven together but to find out just how you will have to read for yourself. I highly recommend you read this if you have not already done so. I think most avid readers will find something they like about this one.",1
"If you're reading reviews for &#34;A Dance with Dragons&#34;, chances are you've read the previous books in the same series, and by now you know whether you want to know what happens next or not, so there's really no purchase advice to give here...A Dance with Dragons is very much in line with the rest of the series in terms of quality. George R.R. Martin is still the same fantastic/sadistic combo, and we can only regret that the plot doesn't move forward much despite the book being over 1000 pages. That said, if you like the universe and the characters, there's no reason not to read it, and be prepared to wait a few more years before the saga comes to its conclusion.",1
"Lady of Hay was my 'first' Barbara E novel - and as a consequence I have a soft spot for it and have to admit to having read it several times.It is not a novel that requires a great deal of thinking on the part of the reader, but that takes nothing away from the story itself, which I enjoyed.The characters did not grab me in the way that I like (writers such as Elizabeth Chadwick 'The Champion' or or Catherine A and Catherine T Wilson 'The Lily and the Lion' do it better) but I liked it none the less.For an international flight or a long car trip.",1
Fast moving. I didn't want to put it down once I started reading it. I will watch for more from this author and plan on buying them A good read,1
Very good book could hardly put it down. Have the movie will now watch it. Give it a 5 star,1
"With vivid, descriptive prose, Hemingway takes us into the mind of a soldier.  Focused on duty and his mission, our main character encounters love among the carnage, but even that does not sway him from his duty.  Though at times a bit long-winded, Hemingway brings the internal battle of war to the surface.  The self-talk that goes on shows the conflict behind the rough exterior.  We also see the useless deaths that take place because of the uncertainties that come with war.",1
"I love the Song of Ice and Fire series, though A Feast for Crows suffered from ""Robert Jordan Syndrome"" - in other words, splitting the narrative into too many viewpoint characters meant that the pacing of the plot slowed to a crawl. So much so that this book is really the second half of A Feast For Crows.This book is better. The writing is engaging (Tyrion is hilarious as hell in this book, even when being emo) and I care more about the characters in this book than in the other.Buuuuuttttt... the plot goes nowhere. GRRM sets up a wonderful predicament for Daenerys in her conquered city. In fact, it is the main plotline of the book. And yet... everything is exactly as it was at the start of the book. The plot doesn't advance.In fact, if you picture the world as a chessboard, between the beginning and the end of the book, only a few pieces have moved. A couple have been removed, a couple have been added, but for all of the extreme length of the book, nothing really happens.It's a shame really, since it was actually a very enjoyable read, much more so than A Feast For Crows. Except for a couple wonderful (and horrible) plot twists, you could easily skip this book, read a one-page summary, and wait for The Winds of Winter.",1
"So the Other Boleyn Girl is really well written, as soon as you start off the book the details are great and it just draws you in like a hook, Gregory really hit the nail on the head with the story itself, I really liked her little twist on George and his irritation with girls :)Though the historical details are extremely inaccurate, but if you don't mind the historical inaccuracies then this book is for you. This book follows mary Boleyn, by the way, not anne. I got  this book due to the fact that I watched the movie and thought it was about Anne, also it shows mary in a much nicer light then what she really was.",1
"After a long wait of nearly six years since the publication of A Feast for Crows, the fifth book in George R.R. Martin's award-winning, best-selling A Song of Ice and Fire series, A Dance with Dragons was released in July 2011.The entire A Song of Ice and Fire series has had a higher profile lately, especially since HBO started airing a mini-series called Game of Thrones based on the first book, A Game of Thrones. Their intention is to shoot each season of the series roughly based on each book in the series. Peter Dinklage won a very important Emmy award (Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series) for his portrayal of Tyrion Lannister, one of the fan's favorite characters.A Dance with Dragons was reviewed by all the major papers of record (Los Angeles Times, New York Times, Time) as well as the usual suspects of media outlets online, generally positively. Among fans, however, the reviews are somewhat mixed, with the feeling that the latest book is closer to A Feast for Crows than  A Storm of Swords. To me, that's to be expected because the timeline of events that occurred in A Feast for Crows occupy about half of the book in A Dance with Dragons, happily told from the perspective of the fan's favorite characters. The problem with this is that not much progress was made on the huge, series-spanning plots like: Daenerys' march to Westeros from Essos, John Snow's attempts to maintain the Wall against the invasion of Creatures of the Frozen North, Bran Stark's destiny to actualize his magical talents and whether the Iron Throne will be controlled by someone who actually deserves the power and cherishes the people they rule, just to name a few. (By some counts, there were around  11 central plots covered in just this book).On extended reflection, I think my overall evaluation of the book is closer to the official reviewer' than the fans'. I've only read A Dance with Dragons once, but I would still rank it as the second best book of the series, behind the impressive A Storm of Swords which is still the best of the bunch with A Dance with Dragons close behind, followed by A Clash of Kings and A Game of Thrones (the less said about A Feast for Crows, the better).I had the good fortune of only starting to read the series in 2011, so I have not had to experience the half-decade long wait for the next installment in the series. Sadly, now that I have caught up with Martin's production schedule, I will have to comfort myself during the long wait for Book 6 (widely reported to be titled The Winds of Winter) by re-reading the first five books and watching the excellent HBO television adaptations of the earlier books (apparently each season of the series will be an adaptation of the corresponding book). Hopefully the next book will be out before the television series catches up with Martin!Title: A Dance with Dragons.Author: George R.R.

"Movie fans who read this novel will recognize some aspects in common with the cult film ""Bladerunner,"" which as everyone knows is the film version of Philip K. Dick's ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?""  I hope that by the end of this review, you will consider ""We Can Build You"" to be worth reading in its own right.In some ways, this is among PKD's most science fictional work; in its first half, anyway, it concerns the impact of a technological advancement on humans of the future.  Two business partners, Louis Rosen and Maury Rock, find their electronic organs less and less saleable; it seems that their major competitor has designed an organ that impacts the audience's mood, not just its sense of hearing.  To survive, the partners develop an artificial human, hoping to use it in Civil War reenactments.Things begin to go south when they attempt to interest the time's leading entrepreneur in their project.  They get more complicated when one of the partners, Lou Rosen, falls in love with the other partner's schizophrenic daughter, Pris Frauenzimmer, who suddenly up and takes a job with the aforementioned leading entrepreneur and takes her father's chief engineer with her.  Meantime, the artificial humans, in the shape of Edwin Stanton and Abraham Lincoln, grow more human and more interested in the business that designed them, while Rosen himself begins to wonder just how human he and Pris really are.Before we judge the success of ""We Can Build You"" in itself, please note the notion of a mood organ, the lead character who finds himself in love with a woman utterly lacking in empathy, the character named Pris, the presence of artificial humans, and the question of what distinguishes an artificial human from a natural one.  There's also plenty of material on the colonization of the other planets and a large, threatening commercial enterprise to contend with.  Lest there was any doubt, we are indeed in ""Blade Runner"" territory, folks - you find each and every one of those things in the novel the movie came from, and most of them in the movie itself.  However, whereas the movie ""Blade Runner"" concerns what makes someone human, and the novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" concerns empathy and its limits, ""We Can Build You"" is about relationships, the constructive and the destructive.Let's face it - if you were reading a science fiction novel by any other author, and in its first half you read about a set of vaguely threatening androids, you'd know what to expect.  Surely said androids would rebel or go mad or take away our TV privileges or something, wouldn't they?  Not in PKD.  This time, the androids (or in the author's preferred term, the simulacra) exist primarily to help the human characters heal their psychic wounds, and to demonstrate by their comparatively humane behavior that not all humans are worth loving.  In itself, that's kind of depressing, but it's not even the truly mind-boggling idea.  About halfway through ""We Can Build You"", the simulacra and their story disappear without a trace, and Louis Rosen comes to understand that as destructive as his love for the schizophrenic Pris can be, his life is banal and totally inauthentic without her.  Oy.Claiming a close relationship between creativity and madness is nothing new, of course.  You might even say that PKD's own life and career is a demonstration of that very notion, to some extent.  In real life, though, things don't work out that way, as the author and his main character come to realize.  This may explain why PKD set ""We Can Build You"" in the first person for the first of only two times in his career.  Louis Rosen narrates the whole thing himself, and however much he insists that Pris is the source of warmth and light in his life, we can see quite plainly because of the first-person narration that her effect on him is destructive of his work, his mind and his soul.The first-person narration also allows PKD to get away with including long philosophical explanations in the middle of his narration.  This actually makes a kind of sense in ""We Can Build You"" - there's something about a depressed and troubled man explaining himself to the reader that's very touching, as it is not when a third-person narrator explains the same character's inner state from some remove.  Maybe PKD should have tried first person more often for the power it gave his writing.  Then again, maybe it was too painful for him to engage in.  ""We Can Build You"" is one of only two or three PKD novels that ends with little or no hope.  It's tempting to suppose that PKD - poor, struggling, hooked on amphetamines and often alone - could not face both his own life and that of his characters without putting some distance between them.Which brings us to the place of ""We Can Build You"" in Philip K. Dick's body of work.  Although this novel came out in 1972, PKD actually wrote it ten years earlier, between the Hugo-winning ""The Man in the High Castle"" and the classic ""Martian Time-Slip"".  He couldn't sell it at the time, maybe because of its more depressing aspects, but it made a good stopgap between the tired ""Our Friends from Frolix 8"" and the rejuvenated ""Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said"".  Anyone who bothers to read PKD's books in the order they were published might find ""We Can Build You"" a hopeful sign, just as a reminder of how powerful the author could be and would be again.Benshlomo says, Madness doesn't really lead to transcendence, but pain might.",1
"I had put off reading this book because I felt it would be ""boring."" I was so very, very wrong! Granted, I have not read everything Hemingway has written, but I find it difficult to believe he could have written anything to surpass this novel. I am thankful that I read ""A Farewell To Arms"" and ""The Sun Also Rises"" before reading this book, as it would have set the standard too high.In the previous books by Hemingway that I've read, he didn't seem to develop the characters fully and many of the scenes were only the sparcest of details. It seemed much had to be filled in by the reader. But 15 years after writing ""The Sun Also Rises"" Hemingway breaks through with ""For Whom The Bell Tolls!"" In this book, Hemingway gives depth to his characters - the reader comes to know, understand, and identify with each character in this book. Hemingway also provides a wonderful description of the area. One can almost envision the mountains and villages and the bridge, which plays a central role. During the scenes involving fighting, the reader can almost hear the gun shots and watch the anguish of those injured or killed. Even in the quiet times of the book, the reader can easily place themselves at the same table as the characters and truly feel they are a part of the story.The ending is easily figured out, but that doesn't seem to matter. Even though the reader might suspect or even know what is to happen, the events leading up to it keep the reader enthralled.This book is a real page-turner, and Hemingway at his best. This is not just a ""guy's book"" - not at all! This is a story for both genders. Treat yourself to a literary masterpiece! You will not be disappointed!",1
"I was so moved by this book that I wish to share my exhilarating read w/ others in hopes of encouraging them to read it.Like many reviewers here, I am a fan of AC.  And yet, I'd have to agree w/ the majority here that Endless Night is by far the most unconventional work of AC. Again, I'd agree w/ most of the critques in that the story moves w/ consistency, yet a bit slower for an AC. Indeed Endless Night can be undoubtedly labeled a mystery, but not the typical mystery that one would come to expect from an AC book. The plot is heavily laced w/ melodrama, evil beyond comprehension, and an impending doom that seems to get under the skin of a compassionate reader.  Out of all of the 8 AC novels that I've read, I never sympathized w/ any of AC's characters  until I read this piece. My heart bled for the victim as much as for the perpetrator. So much so, that I woke up the next day STILL contemplating these characters!! The only reservation I had about it was that AC managed to overlook a cpl of minuscule details that were never explained at the end. To the avg reader, it may not matter, but for the analyticals at heart, it may. Overall, an EXCELLENT READ!!!!",1
Who does not like this series? I was skeptical but he is such a good creator of very in-depth characters and an amazing world.,1
"At the time of this review there are over 1,700 reviews posted so I won't bother to sum up the story but just my opinion of the book.I thought the book was simple to read, an interesting story and engaging characters.Even though this novel is not perfect and a standard ""boy meets girl"" story with a charming setting, the descriptions are colorful and the characters are a variety of misfits; but somehow it all works and comes together very nicely for an entertaining and well paced read.Granted, the book is not going to be put on a shrine of the scholarly literary Olympus, but to me this book felt as if I was reading a fairytale - and I tremendously enjoyed it.",1
Over all I did enjoy the book. It was a little hard to get into at first but the characters are great. The book triggers several different emotions and the last few chapters are addicting. It was very well written and quite enjoyable. Would recommend for 16+.,1
"As avid readers there are times when we are apt to encounter books that continue and linger in our minds once read.  For me, ""Water for Elephants"" was a serendipitous find and I truly and lovingly enjoyed this novel.  It's one of those books that you never want to end.  There is reason why this book has been on the NY Times bestseller list for more than 12 consecutive weeks.  As many reviewers have already recounted the summary I will simply say just READ IT!  I promise you will be searching for more of Sara Gruen's novels.  BTW, Apehouse is the next novel to be released!",1
"Sara Gruen's Water for Elephants will probably top the list for the books I read in 2010 (3 months left, so come on authors, wow me!).  It is evident that Gruen painstakingly researched life in the 1930's circuis, and her hard work paid off with a nice slice of Americana.  The book's plot kept me turning pages late into the night.Others have complained about the book's vulgarity, and I'll admit that several scenes were a bit too vulgar for my taste, but the subject is the depression-era circus, not nursery school.  While not necessarily pleasant, it was probably befitting the subject matter.The greatest praise I'll give Gruen was in her ending.  The fiction-literature authors of the last decade seem to be of the notion that a depressing ending makes for good literature.  I would like to remind these authors that I read fiction as an escape from reality, not as a desire to have more of it.  To Gruen's credit, she reached for the best ending possible, and she nailed it!  I hope the rest of her books are as good as this one!",1
"I enjoyed this book so much, I did not want the story to end.  Alternately told between the main character as a youth and reminiscing as an old man.  This takes you back to a time when the world was a lot simpler, if you remember the time when a circus would show up in your small town and just as quickly disappear.  The end is a gem, won't spoil it for those who have not read it.  I couldn't put it down, just pure entertainment.",1
"I'm not sure what to say about this book.  I enjoyed it - it's a cute little historical fiction - but it wasn't fantastic.  just a few random thoughts on the book:* The most interesting character was Walter the dwarf clown and he had a very limited role.* Jacob, the narrator I liked more as a 93yo than as a 23yo, and I never really felt the connection between him and Marlena.* The grime of the circus itself was part of what kept me sucked in - that was brilliantly described.* In the end, I felt a great deal of sympathy for August - he wasn't a good man by any means, but he also was fighting some serious demons.Like I said, I liked the book but I don't feel I need to run out and watch the movie now ....",1
"This is a collection of short stories including some featuring Hercule Poirot, a Parker Pyne story and some Mr Satterthwaite and Harley Quinn stories as well as a couple which don't feature any of the author's regular detectives.  I particularly enjoyed the Harley Quinn stories as they always have that extra dimension as well as being mysteries.I particularly enjoyed the last story in the collection `Magnolia Blossom' which caused me to reach for the tissues.  It certainly shows human nature in the worst possible light.  Apart from that one I also enjoyed `The Harlequin Tea Set' and `The Love Detectives'.  This is an interesting collection and could be a good introduction to Agatha Christie's writing for someone who hasn't read anything by her before.",1
"I've read a lot of the criticism about Executive Orders and I agree with some of it.  So what?  It's not perfect.  Then again what book is?  If you're looking for high-tech action, political intrigue, and lots of page-flipping fun, you'll enjoy this book.  The terrorist attack at the end of Debt of Honor leaves Jack Ryan in the oval office and he has very little time to get his feet on the ground before the next national emergency strikes.  Flawless realism?  No.  Pulse-pounding fun?  You bet.",1
"I bought this book for my son who had his stolen from him and was in despair.  He likes the beautiful poetic resonance and in looking through the book, I agree.  This is a book for sensitive souls, beautifully written and illustrated by the author.",1
"Winds of War is the fictional account of the family Henry and their adventures from 1938 through Pearl Harbor. Captain Pug Henry, a career Naval Officer is sent to Germany to serve as Naval Attache in Berlin. There he meets all the big players, Hitler, Goering et al. He predicts the Stalin-Hitler non-agression pact and gets called to the White House. There Roosevelt gives him an informal assignment that keeps him involved in myriad interesting developments leading up to the invasion of Poland, then France, the Battle of Britain, and the invasion of Russia. Meanwhile, his son Brian, in Italy working for a Jewish author falls in love with the beautiful Jewish-American niece who was engaged to an American diplomat, who happens to be serving in Warsaw ... naturally Brian and Natalie are visiting her old friend Slote in Warsaw when the Germans attack. Meanwhile ... well you get the point.A popular miniseries was made of this book and its sequel, War and Remembrance.This book is VERY historically accurate. All the events are true, and one of the Henrys or their acquaintances are involved in one or more of them. This is a great read. Brilliantly told, we work through the great events through the experiences of the characters.",1
"Amazing read. Could not put it down. I will be ordering more books by Philippa  Gregory.  Romantic, descriptive, fast paced.",1
This is a wonderful book.  Beautifully written and thoroughly engrossing.  An absolute pleasure.  Highly and enthusiastically recommended.,1
"Jack Aubrey's dreams of success in the British Navy get a boost when he is assigned as the Commodore of a fleet near Mauritius. But, along with the glory of the management post, comes the hellish torture of responsibility  for the actions of several captains less capable than Jack.Aubrey and  Maturin finally fully join their mental forces in the attempt to understand  just what makes each captain in the fleet tick. Each at their own level  (Maturin's rather deeper), they form a concept of the other personalities  they must work with. And Aubrey ultimately finds that even the best  planning can be brought to nought by one committee or another...This  book also gives us a gently amusing glimpse of Aubrey's life on land as a  married man. As with all the Aubrey/Maturin books, this is by turns amusing  and thoughtful, as well as realistic and picturesque.",1
I have been too busy reading these fantastic tales and now looking for more.  Can not get enough of his writing.  I think his next book is Winds of Winter and should be out soon.,1
"***This review may contain spoilers.***The title of my review is the question that encompasses and permeates Hemingway's deceptively simple and straightforward war saga in ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" (hereafter FWTBT).  This existential question certainly torments FWTBT's protagonist Robert Jordan, an American ex-patriate, Spanish professor, and bridge demolitions expert allied with several Spanish communist guerrilla fighters against the fascists in their late `30s civil war.  Robert certainly doesn't want to deal with this abstract dilemma.  An efficient, meticulous professional, he merely wants to destroy a strategic bridge in order to slow the fascist advance.  But, this task is not so cut-and-dry as it seems.  Like an unemotional surgeon, Robert has to time the explosion precisely in order to delay the fascists enough so that the main communist forces led by General Golz can arrive in time to retaliate.  This means there is plenty of idle, ""dead"" time to not only plan the demolition, but also to somewhat unwillingly get drawn into the lives, hopes, and fates of the guerrilla fighters.And what vibrant, compelling, unforgettable characters these fighters are!  One of the most admirable fighters is the elderly but capable and loyal guerrilla veteran Anselmo who helps Robert execute the complicated demolition and attack lookout logistics.  Despite his war experience, Anselmo wrestles with qualms about killing others, since it conflicts with fading but still strong religious convictions, but he constantly convinces himself that it is for the good of ""The Republic"".  In spite of himself, Robert mirrors the same misgivings, even though he is a self-professed atheist.  An even more conflicted guerrilla veteran is the swinish but cunning Pablo, who was once a dedicated insurrectionist but may have lost his nerve because of new materialistic longings, especially for horses.  His allegiance to the cause is uncertain, especially to Robert.  There is the alluring, violated, seemingly fragile and traumatized, but nevertheless determined revolutionary Maria, with whom the surprisingly (to him) smitten Robert shares a passionate relationship.  Then there is the plump, matronly, wise, outspoken and totally indomitable amazon Pilar, wife of Pablo and fierce protector of Maria, the equal of (and probably superior to) any man.  She provides Robert comforting adages, observations, and moral support.  She has her own misgivings about war, fighting, and killing like the rest of the group, but her patriotism and the promise of a fair Republic, as well as her sturdy personality, keeps her going.As I said, despite his best efforts to distance himself from the guerilla fighters' personal dramas and remain practical and professional, Robert finds himself drawn in.  Although FWTBT gives the lie to war's depiction as continuous, monumental action (in the novel, it is often quiet and dull with only occasional, sporadic bursts of fire and action), it seems to see the Spanish civil war as meaningful and important, unlike a lot of wars.  FWTBT hints that Robert sees this war the same way and that he wants to contribute to the communists' worthy cause of freedom and autonomy.  Not only that, it also seems he wants to perpetuate his grandfather's heroic Civil War legacy, and expunge the cowardly shame of his father's suicide.Nevertheless, even worthy wars can demand actions that can be unconscionable in peacetime.  For example, Pablo's potential for betrayal prompts the guerrilla band and Robert to debate whether to kill Pablo.  Again, killing is supposed to be wrong,but in this case may save the lives of others.  But as counterpoint, Pilar relates the grisly tale of how Pablo, she, and several citizens of a Spanish town captured several fascists (including priests) and made them run a deadly gauntlet.  Even though it felt right and pleasurable to beat and humiliate this evil enemy, and even though they were ""losing their religion"", Pilar still felt remorse for such barbaric actions.  Not only were they barbaric, they were futile; the fascists took the town anyway.  No wonder Robert struggles to keep a clinical, impersonal perspective on this war; he fears that if he cares too much, he can't do his job effectively.Even in his intimate relations with Maria, Robert keeps this arms-length attitude.  Make no mistake, he appreciates her company and feels she has made his life sweeter and more substantial, but he also resents the fact that it happened too late and in war time and that war could end it.  But of course Maria's mixture of unjustly tarnished innocence, her fierce devotion to him, and her staunch revolutionary parentage endears Robert to her and evokes protective feelings equal to Pilar's.  He even goes so far to say that he is ""married"" to her and one with her and describes plans on how they will live their lives together in Madrid post-war, though FWTBT is a wee bit unclear as to how sincere Robert is about all this.As the war continues, and the bridge demolition time nears, this existential struggle plays out, most tellingly in Robert's internal monologues.  Throughout FWTBT, his admiration for the guerrilla fighters rises and falls, his opinion of the war oscillates between worthwhile and incompetently chaotic, and his will to live and fight waxes and wanes.  The chapters on the fascist's horrific besiegement of stalwart communist guerrilla fighter El Sordo, the Robert's guerrilla fighters' noble but impractical desire to help El Sordo, and guerrilla fighter Andres' resolute but probably futile efforts to get Robert's message to General Golz to delay his attack because the advancing fascists were not vulnerable enough - all this reflects Robert's vacillating thinking.To the very end of FWTBT, Robert struggles.  Does it matter whether he blows the bridge up or not?  The fascists will come anyway.  Robert and his band must retreat, including Maria, whom he may not ever see again.  Finally, a leg injury forces Robert to make a choice between two terrible actions that might be considered dishonorable at most times.  However, in war time, either action might be seen as a noble self-sacrifice.  Whichever Robert chooses, it will finally convince him that, in at least this circumstance, life is indeed worth living, fighting, and dying for.Some observations:1. Like Hemingway's other war novel ""A Farewell to Arms"" (see my Amazon review if you are interested) FWTBT deals with the pain and the elation of war, love, and inevitable death.  I believe FWTBT is the greater novel because unlike ""A Farewell to Arms"" it finds hope where there is no hope to be found.2. The ""thees"", ""thys"", and ""thous"" in the dialogues between Robert and the guerrilla fighters sounded a bit artificial to me.  Of course, FWTBT is based upon Hemingway's experience, so I must assume the dialogue is authentic.  Still, it sounded like an Amish community.3. As in ""A Farewell to Arms"", the love interest Maria in FWTBT is decidedly compliant, obedient, and almost worshipful to her man.  Of course, the circumstances in both novels explain that most un-feminist attitude.  Still, it can sound like Hemingway's private romantic fantasy, especially with that unintentionally comic (to me) phrase, ""Did the earth move?"".4. If you haven't read FWTBT and plan to, keep a Spanish dictionary handy.  Hemingway does translate most of the Spanish phrases he uses, but not all of them.  Furthermore, be warned: many of the Spanish phrases are obscene, if amusingly so.",1
"Well written at a good pace with events. Kind of weird with the flipping between timeline, but I see this type of conversation with my dad. Will not see the movie as I enjoyed the book more than I thought I would. Is a good read.",1
I am a fan and love all her books. I read her series novels as well as anything else I see her name on. I am an Italian American living on the east coast and worked for 20 years in the criminal justice system. I find her Italian references and family life realistic and funny.,1
"I really enjoyed this book, I have read others of the Alex Cross series and wanted to start at the begining so I bought this one.  It was exciting and had a lot of great twists.",1
"Set during the Spanish Civil War, Ernest Hemingway's ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" tells the story of Robert Jordan, a young American who is serving as a demolitions expert for the Republican cause.  The novel follows his experiences with a band of guerrilla fighters as he undertakes a mission to blow up a strategic bridge.  The whole novel, except for some flashbacks and reminiscences of various characters, covers just a few days.Although the novel focuses on a small number of characters in a fairly compressed time period, Hemingway attains a real epic feel with this book.  The novel is fairly lengthy (471 pages in the 2003 Scribner edition), but I found it to be a swift read--indeed, often difficult to put down.  There is much that is noteworthy about this novel.  It offers a compelling perspective on war from the viewpoint of guerrilla forces, rather than conventional forces (interested readers might want to check out Mao Tse-Tung's ""On Guerrilla Warfare"" for some theoretical and historical perspective).  The novel also deals with the phenomenon of ideologically committed foreign forces in Spain's Fascist-versus-Republican conflict.Hemingway deals with the issues of love and sex in a combat zone, as well as with the roles of women in a guerrilla force.  Other significant issues include loyalty, leadership, communications, military hardware, the impact of weather and terrain, and the connection between guerrilla and conventional forces.  Particularly interesting is Hemingway's portrait of Robert Jordan as a technically and tactically skilled guerrilla fighter, and as a leader of guerrilla fighters.  Thus the book should interest not just lovers of literature, but also serious military professionals and students of the history of warfare.Hemingway offers a grim and graphic look at the brutality of 20th century warfare.  War is not glamorized or sanitized, and atrocities are described in unflinching detail.  The characters explore the ethics of killing in war.  As the story progresses, Hemingway skillfully peels back the layers of Jordan and other characters to reveal their psychological wounds.  But the book is not all about pain and violence.  In the midst of war Hemingway finds the joy and beauty that keep his characters going.  He also incorporates storytelling as a powerful motif in the book; his characters share stories with each other, recall missing untold stories, or resist a story too hard to bear.  In Hemingway's world storytelling is as essential a human activity as eating, fighting, and lovemaking.Hemingway's writing appeals to all the senses as he creates some vivid scenes.  He demonstrates his mastery of the art of fiction; he continually makes interesting choices and creates some really striking and beautiful passages.  ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" is an exceptionally haunting work of literature; I consider this rich and rewarding text to be an essential volume in the canon of war fiction.  For intriguing companion texts that also deal with the Spanish Civil War, I recommend ""Spain's Cause Was Mine: A Memoir of an American Medic in the Spanish Civil War,"" by Hank Rubin, and ""The Confessions of Senora Francesca Navarro and Other Stories,"" by Natalie L. M. Petesch.",1
Very different from #1 - somewhat of a soap opera air to a large part of it. That part did a lot for character development and there is enough action interspersed to keep it going. Look for me reading #3.,1
"I'm not really sure how I feel after reading this book. It started off great, with a hint of mystery. The author's writing style flowed by easily and it was packed with great descriptions and similies. However, after 65% (kindle version) of nothing but beautiful language, I got bored and wanted to finish the book just to see what would happen. And then I found out what happened and was unsatisfied. Is that all? Maybe I missed something, but to me a novel is more than great writing.",1
"I really hate to say this but...I loved the first 4 books in this series. I grant you, some more than others but love them I did. So it  pains me to admit that I have no love for this installment. In fact, i am shocked to say I found it extremely tedious. There was so much journeying and very little arriving that it was like an interminable, one step forwards two steps back , talky travelogue. It seems GRRM may need a more assertive editor.I knew that his book was going to feel more like book 4, volume 2 than a book 5 but I still found it disconcerting that ADWD went back over already travelled ground. I would have preferred that the two books had been split by time rather than POV but that's just me. At about the 70% mark  it did get somewhat more interesting..When Cersei's story was continued I became more engaged, but Briennes story development was kind a wtf moment for me. Did I misread that last time we saw her? No explanation , really?Tyrion, usually a POV I enjoy the most was one I found myself reading some pages and skimming many  others. My heart sank in disappointment a couple of times when I approached his chapters. What a yawn.I also thought that the sexually explicit scenes and vocabulary, while always on the crude side, veer further into the arena of the gratuitous and perverse n this book. Especially when it comes to describing women. It came across as relentlessly  demeaning. One scene in particular comes to mind: a certain wedding night. I understand that the behavior of the groom was in line with his character but the bride was supposed to be only 10 or 11 yrs old! A line was crossed there for me. GRRM just loves the C word doesn't he? It never bothered me previously. I barely noticed it before, but it irritated me at times with this one.So, sadly this was a disappointing read for me.",1
"There is a lot of overlap with the John Lofty Wiseman's other survival manual, but that's because you need to know a lot of the same things in a crisis situation whether you're in an urban or wilderness situation. This survival book adds a bunch of things that the other book doesn't have--how to deal with terrorist acts like a hijacking, natural disasters like a tsunami, dangerous dogs, and all kinds of other stuff. This is the kind of reference that you might look through just for fun to learn a few things, but it's all an essential home reference that you'll be damn glad you have close at hand if all hell breaks loose or even if there's just one of those minor, everyday disasters.",1
"Alistair Maclean's novel, 'Where Eagles Dare,' is a great adventure story that takes the reader back to the desperate days of World War Two.  The story centers around a crack British commando team infiltrating a Bavarian  stronghold to rescue a high-ranking American officer.  From start to finish  this is riviting fiction.  Maclean's protagonists are the kind of  characters that make you want to cheer and the plot contains enough twists  to keep you guessing right up to the end.  The movie version of this novel,  which stars Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood, is one of the the most  faithful film interpretations of a book ever made.  Read the book and then  see the film!",1
There is just too much book here for the story to go almost no where. It's still a good story but reading it is a chore.,1

"This is a tour-de-force of history. Martin Gilbert had an ambitious project -- cover the whole Holocaust from the pre-Hitler days to after the war, all over Europe -- but he was able to accomplish his ends without either glossing over anything or making it too long. I was dizzied by the number of sources he quoted. The guy really knows how to write, too, and put his sources together into one coherent narrative.Two caveats: Gilbert transliterates proper names strangely. For example, Tuvia Bielsky is called ""Tobias Belsky."" Also, the book was written over 25 years ago and is a little dated as a result; a lot of research has been done since then. Has he put out a second edition? In the meantime, Martin Gilbert is my new superhero.",1
"The facts were horribly skewed, Anne's character was evil, Mary was dumb, and there was lots of soap opera drama, but I don't care because I loved it!  I loved that Anne was a scheming shrew, George was gay, and that they allegedly had an incestuous child that died in utero, but most of all I love that it was such a fun story to read.  It was almost trailer trash, but so unabashed in it's telling that you've got to admit that Gregory has balls.  As for the fact that it wasn't true to fact...who cares?  It's a story and a great one at that!",1
"The book is about a backpacker who finds a dead body on a trail in Nepal, which has been mutilated in the same way his girlfriend was in Cameroon two years previously.  Our hero sets out to find the killer.  The book's about much more than that, however.  It's about recovering from the death of a loved one.  It's about backpacking, and travelling around the world, and needing to do so to the point where you only take jobs that will give you months of leave.  It's about the bursting of the Internet bubble.  It's about the concept of tribe, a chosen family that is your support network no matter how far away they are. It's about using the Internet to find people and track them down.  And, yeah, there's a cool mystery in there, too. Evans captures the feeling of being on the edge of 30, and unwilling to buy into the two-kids-and-a-dog suburban lifestyle.",1
This is such a beautiful story. I enjoyed the story line and the characters and I felt that it was well researched also.,1

"""Endless Night"", written late in Agatha Christie's career, shows well her gifts for clever plot lines and spare but effective characterizations, as well as Christie's solid ability to remain current to the times in which she wrote, which spanned the end of the World War I through the early 1970s.  Much has been written about Christie's genius for constructing original puzzles, but her writing in books like this makes such expositions superfluous.The solution to this mystery is as ingenious as the solutions to the crimes in ""Murder on the Orient Express"", ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd"", and ""Ten Little Indians.""  This book is truly a mystery lover's delight.DO NOT READ ANY REVIEWS REVEALING THE PLOT DEVICE!!!!  This is one of the true mystery novels that should be read for the delight of its construction!",1

"Six years in the making; over a thousand pages in length: while A Dance with Dragons has gone on to become an instant super bestseller (as well as the hardcover outselling the eBook edition), sadly the best thing about this book is really that fantastically mesmerizing cover.  This mighty tome falls more in line with its less well received and not so well reviewed predecessor, A Feast for Crows, than with the groundbreaking first three books of A Song of Ice and Fire.  It seems that time may not be the best thing for George R. R. Martin when it comes to writing his epic series, as he seems to enjoy spending more time describing scenery, and food, and anything gruesome or unpleasant than moving the story along.  He goes on tangents, taking trips with new characters that appear to have little bearing on the main plot; or spends literally hundreds of pages with characters readers have come to know so well and love . . . and nothing bloody happens!  Martin is becoming what can only really be truthfully described as Jordanian; no he's not immigrating to Jordan, but writing in the style of the man who became the true master of the ""massive mass market,"" Robert Jordan.Warning: here be spoilers.In the North, around the Wall, King Stannis Baratheon seems to spend a lot of time trying to decide what to do with no real power or army to use, while listening to Lady Melisandre, who continues to spout enigmatic prophecies that make little sense; yet readers do get to enjoy a chapter from her viewpoint for the first time.  Meanwhile, Jon Snow is elected as the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, as he must deal with not just enemies beyond the Wall, but also amongst the very men he leads and is in charge of.  He works with the wildlings, bringing them south of the wall to bolster his forces in preparation for a possible attack from the Others; it seems to be an interesting act of diplomacy, but goes on for far too many pages, with little action or continuing story taking place.Much of the rest of the book takes place to the far east.  Martin has provided a couple of new maps, but nothing so clearly defined and comprehendible as the great continent of Westeros.  Tyrion flees to Pentos, drowning himself in wine.  He is forced to join with a group traveling to Meereen, along with the apparently not so dead prince Aegon Targaryen.  Tyrion - as he always does - manages to get involved in a whole variety of adventures, including the meeting of another dwarf, and a female no less!Daenerys is the character that seems most put through the ringer in this book; much like Cercei was in A Feast for Crows.  She is no longer the tough, proud, defiant woman that everyone feared, and not just because she has three growing dragons.  Having conquered Meereen, she should be the unstoppable, unquestionable queen that she is, and yet insurrection is afoot and Daenerys cannot seem to decide what to do; perhaps it is because she has become obsessed and besotted with one of her soldiers and seems to be able to think of little else when he is nearby, and yet he is of lower class and cannot possibly be her husband.  The black dragon, Drogon, meanwhile is running rampant through the countryside as growing ""teenage"" dragons do, and Daenerys has no idea how to control him.Finally there is Quentyn Martell, Prince of Dorne, whose story comes from nowhere as we follow his trek across the lands to Meereen, where he hopes to woo Daenerys by enslaving one of her dragons.  It does not end well for him.  Interspersed throughout the lengthy book are other POV chapters from the likes of Bran Stark, Davos Seaworth, Reek (who is in fact the very not dead Theon Greyjoy), Arya Stark, Victarion Greyjoy, as well as some surprise cameos from Jaime and Cercei Lannister.  These appearances may not have be so incomprehensible if their storylines were allowed to go somewhere, and yet many of them barely get one chapter, leaving the reader wondering why they were ever added to this book in the first place.  What was the point?  Especially when many hundreds of pages are spent on other main characters, with very little happening with them, other than plenty of description of what they're wearing, what they're eating, and what the scenery looks like.  Pure Jordanian!At a recent signing, George R. R. Martin briefly brought up one of his most tumultuous periods in the six-year writing saga of A Dance with Dragons, saying that in a year or two who would discuss it in greater detail once everyone had read the book, but confessing that he had sacrificed at least a year at what he refers to as his ""Meereenese Knot,"" in trying to decide how events were to transpire and what characters and POVs were to be involved, featuring rewrite after rewrite after rewrite.  It seems Martin may have in fact written himself into a deep, dark pit of despair that he hasn't really been able to write himself out of.  Perhaps he should've scrapped everything and started again?  After sacrificing over a half a decade of his life and the reader's impatient waiting, he couldn't exactly do that.  Instead, the result is a book that is too long, has too little going on, and falls behind A Feast for Crows in that it is that much longer with less important story happening.There may be a number of readers under the same delusion suffered by those who professed the excellence and genius of the Star Wars prequels, starting with A Phantom Menace; but over time have come to realize the error of their ways and the true reality of the situation.  A Dance with Dragons just simply isn't that good of a book, but does serve to further the story somewhat, and fill in the details with many words and many pages and little action.  At the end readers will certainly be left unsatisfied, as they ponder on the possibilities of the penultimate book in the seven-book series (assuming it will stay at this number) with The Winds of Winter, where winter will supposedly have finally arrived.  The question remains: if winter is finally here, how long will it be before readers actually get to read about it?Originally written on August 9, 2011  Alex C.

Didn't have the type of info I thought would be in it but for the $$$ not a bad read.,1
"This book is great as a condensed version of the original.  It is great for taking along on hikes or other trips where you don't have the space or weight available for larger guides.  The print is small if that bothers you, but it is necessarily so.  This is a great starter gift for kids who want to explore the outdoors safely, and a great guide to leave in your car or backpack, just in case of a Bug Out situation.",1
Somehow Sara Gruen managed to make a thriller out of a nursing home escape via front wheel walker and wheelchair.  Just my way to illustrate a wonderful writing style and imagination.,1
One of my favorite books now. I devoured this book. Easy read and gets you hooked right away. I love historical fiction and now am reading all kinds of things about the circus during the early - mid 20th century.,1
This final book of the series ties up some loose ends but still leaves many questions unanswered. What happens to Arya? What of Sansa? We need more answers!,1
"Absolutely my favorite Agatha Christie book.  I loved the surprise ending.  I have a paperback copy in my bookcase but it had been years since I had read it as the printing is too small for me to read now.  I wanted to read it again and I now have a Kindle (love my Kindle) so I got it for the Kindle.  I still think it is a great story and still love the ending.  Of course, Agatha Christie is still one of the best.",1
A good book but i didn't  know there is a sequel. I don't think I would have bought the first one.,1
"There's a hilarious scene in Michael Chabon'sWonder Boys: A Novel, in which pothead author Grady Tripp is confronted by his student Hannah Green about his monstrously overdue and overlong manuscript, which she is the first person to have read. Tentatively, she explains that while the first few hundred pages were amazing, he seems to have lost control of the narrative, especially when he gets into lengthy side narratives about the histories of ancient ruins and the genealogies of minor characters' horses.""'Grady,' she said, sounding more than a little horror-struck. 'You have whole chapters that go for thirty and forty pages _with no characters at all_!'""Now, I don't know if George R.R. Martin shares Grady Tripps fondness for the good herb, but he definitely shares the core symptom of not being able to make his story smaller, even when that would make it better. And like Tripp, he has an overwhelming fondness for lengthy asides and genealogies of sometimes terrifying detail - though none yet for horses, thank the Seven.Certainly he remains a productive and very gifted writer. I actually enjoyed A Dance with Dragons more than most reviewers so far. Hence the four stars, which I know I'm going to get reprimanded for despite writing a pretty critical review. But I did enjoy the book! It's mostly quite well-written, and despite the frequent complaint that ""nothing happens,"" is actually packed with events. There are plenty of exciting scenes, some clever plot twists, and a few revelations about ancient mysteries and the motivations of certain key players. The chapters set in the North are particularly good, and I also liked the Tyrion chapters a lot (though I know many other readers did not).The problem is that by the end of the book, the reader feels that the series is no closer to a finale than it was at the beginning. This world Martin's created just seems to get bigger and bigger and bigger, and is now firmly in danger of getting too vast for its own good. And Martin over-indulges in too many of his own equivalents of the genealogies of horses - histories of minor houses, squabbles over tracts of land, and other details that just don't command enough of the reader's emotions.Moreover, many of the newer additions to the population of Essos and Westeros are less interesting than the old ones. I speak of course of the teeming host of Meereenese characters, who all seem have names like Grover zo Snuffleupagus, but whose personalities do not shine through nearly as brightly as their ridiculously colored beards. Martin has an impressive ability to make even his side characters come across as fully-formed people, but with this last book it's pretty clear that he's hit his limit.The first three books of the A Song of Ice and Fire series are about as good as popular fiction gets - whatever the genre. And unlike some, I still hold out hope that Martin can turn the tide and give this series the climax and ending it deserves. But to do that, he's going to have to start making his story smaller rather than bigger, and that's going to require some difficult decisions. But, to quote Hannah Green in the movie of Wonder Boys, that's what writers do. They make decisions.UPDATE: After pondering the book some more, and reading some other reviews by people I respect, I've decided to downgrade this one to three stars. I did enjoy the book in its own right, and continue to think that the frequent complain that ""nothing happens"" is rather ridiculous. But the key problem remains that Martin is not making the difficult decisions needed to bring this series to the lively climax it deserves. And more people are watching now than ever before. He needs to fire his editor and kill or compress about half of his POV characters in order to right the ship, and to do those things he's going to need some friendly but unmerciful feedback.",1
"This tells the story of two important historical figures in English monarch history -- Anne and Mary Boleyn. Each sister has competed against the others for years, but now they have the biggest competition of all -- they're competing for the heart of the King of England. There is no greater prize than Henry, King of England.This novel is a riveting tale about love, betrayal, and life in the English court. Just when you find yourself on top, you realize you can't stay there for long -- and there are consequences to lying and scheming your way to the top. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for an engrossing, can't-put-down story.*5 STARS*[...]",1

"Love the story, love the unique characters.  Felt like I really got to know them. There is a total of 5 books, however, it felt as though it was not finished and there should be one more book to finish the story.  Also caught some of the characters on the tv show Game of Thrones.  So glad I read the book first, it really put all in place.  BUT believe me these are long long long books.",1
"Both history and fiction about the Second World War are replete with stories of heroism and courage under fire.  This novel, steeped in solid research, explores the period before war breaks out and during the first year or so of hostilities.  It's a picture of the British ruling class, rife with indulgence, ambition and anti-Semitism.  Excellent writing and engrossing storytelling.",1
"Well, I couldn't put it down, once I started in earnest. The characters are rich and well drawn. The historical perspectives leaves a bit to be desired. Ms Gregory does miss out on some of the dialogue of the time, playing up on some of the &quot;rumors&quot; instead of facts. A few of the characters are not historically accurate. If you can ignore the inaccuracies, this is a definite page turner and is excellently told. I can forgive a little license for a good story.",1
I just finished reading this and I expect it will be the best book of fiction that I read this year. I usually buy a book for Christmas each year for a friend and an elderly aunt. This is the book for 2007! My only disappointment is that Sara Gruen does not have a long list of other books for me to read. I also loved the photos that were at the beginning of the chapters. Sara Gruen is going to the top of the list of my favorite authors!!,1

"Was curious about this book and decided to purchase the Kindle version of it and check it out.  Throughout the course of the  book you see Jake in the nursing home and Jake in the past.  Jake in the nursing home is looking forward to seeing the circus which has come to town.  But first he has to deal with a couple more days until that time comes and you learn a little bit of what his like is like in the nursing home.  He's not too happy and he every once in awhile starts to reminisce what it was like when he was much younger and he became part of a circus.  Since he had been in veterinary school before stowing away on the circus train he ends up being put in charge of the animals.  One of which is an elephant.  The elephant is not treated well at all and Jake even becomes frustrated with it until the day he realizes that the elephant doesn't understand commands because he learned them in another language.  Once that barrier is broken he and the elephant end up developing a close relationship as he's about the only one who actually treats the animals with any compassion and care.  He also falls in love with Marlena who is married to the very temperamental ring master.  Considering the time period of the book, it's quite possible that her husband suffered from manic depression as the man's mood swings go from very happy to incredibly abusive and destructive.  Over the course of the book we find out more of what happened between Jake and his elephant and also what happened with him and Marlena.Throughout the course of the book you learn a lot about what circuses were like back in the thirties.  Sometimes a bigger circus would acquire a smaller circus and combine the two.  A lot of times the workers went a long ways toward being paid.  And sometimes the owners of the circus would scramble from opportunity to opportunity in order to have enough money to keep the circus running.  And the performers traveled from city to city by train, which would have not only been hard on them but as the animals as well.  If you like animals this can be a difficult book to read from time to time, but it's a fascinating look at circuses that I enjoyed the book very much anyway.  Someday I may get the sequel to find out more of what happened to Jake both past and present.",1
"When I first read this I was surprised because Alistair Maclean had written Cold War thrillers, novels located in Arctic locales, some contemporary novels and some with World War II in the background. This was his first, and only, venture into the American West.Always thought this was one of his best novels. After this, the author sadly began to decline. But in ""Breakheart Pass"" his prose was still sharp and so was his plot. As in many of his novels, his characters are on a ship or outpost or, in this case, a train and a number of mysterious deaths occur. Clearly one or more of the characters are killers.This was made into a movie with Charles Bronson and it's one of the few MacLean books that Hollywood didn't screw up. That's probably because MacLean wrote the script and it adheres closely to the novel. A very suspensful tale. In his prime there was no one better than MacLean. The novel is a fitting tribute to the old West.",1
"Ninety-year old Jacob lives in a nursing home where he spends most days parked in the hallway, waiting for Sundays when a visitor comes.  He's excited because a traveling circus has set up next door and he can't wait to go.  He flashes back to his youth during the Depression, when he was penniless and joined a third-rate circus as an almost-qualified vet.  There, he fell in love with Marlena, the beautiful star horsewoman.  Unfortunately, his boss was her brutish husband.I absolutely loved this book.  It contrasts the misery of being old and helpless with the non-stop action of life ""on the show,"" though that certainly had its share of misery, too.  The pathetic circus Jacob joined was full of lively characters, some kindly, others cruel, and Jacob was forced to grow from naive youth to courageous man.  There were many pages that reduced me to sobs, especially those detailing the agonizing despair of some nursing home residents and some instances of animal cruelty at the circus.I would have given this book five stars, but I didn't like that it was written in the first person (which immediately takes away some suspense as to the future of the narrator), and it was written entirely in the present tense which struck me as awkward.  The story itself is engaging, exciting, touching, and rewarding.  Highly recommended.",1
I loved this book and never wanted it to end. I've read it several times and each time I have enjoyed it even more.If you like a great book with adventure this is the one for you. It was absolutely amazing. Never a dull moment.,1
"'Executive Orders' makes a strong case for being Clancy's greatest novel.  Dealing with the beginnning of Jack Ryan's Presidency, 'Orders' has Ryan coming to grips with his new situation as chief executive while battling  foreign and domestic enemies who seek to undermine the USA.  One of the  greatest aspects of Clancy's novels is the optimism in America that they  inspire.  'Orders' in no exception.

"Another star lost for excessive details. I feel like at some point I should really cut Martin a break, but then again I think about how I put over forty hours into finishing this book and I completely change my mind. Story telling shouldn't move at a snail's pace more than half the time. So here is the breakdown of events in this book. People get killed again for unfounded reasons, and others most likely at the end of the book will seem to be killed, but events in the next book will explain how that at the last second they were spared.I almost feel like Maritn does not know where to go with the story, so he just creates some other conspiracy out of the blue to distract the reader for another four hundred pages. So if you are reading this review, I take it most likely you are where I am with your reading of this compendium, and there are things that just as I said don't make sense. Some things happen and you just have to wonder why Martin would make the characters act a certain way, for example:Where we left off with Forest Gump, errr......I mean Samwell Tarley (this was in A Feast for Crows): for some inexplicable reason before he left on a mission to Bravos he never told Jon Snow that his brothers were alive and well. Promise or no promise to Bran, if you had a best friend and had knowledge that his younger half-brothers were alive, wouldn't you just tell him, ""Hey, don't tell anyone else, but your brothers are totally not dead."" As Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, I think Jon could be trusted to keep mum.Anyway, I don't want to get in a lengthy spiel again about how the details are out of control again, so I cut straight into my own theories about what will possibly happen instead:Theory I - There are to be three Dragon Riders that constantly get mentioned. We have Dany, and her cousin who had been thought to have been killed when he was a baby. (Aegon), so that leaves one more needed Rider (Unless people or Dany just kills her dragon Drogon. Which I think she should do. I mean this dragon was killing kids and eating them. When a pet goes wild, you have to put it down. I mean look what they did to Lady, and Nimeria was the one that attacked Joeffrey.)  So anyway, I think that Jon Snow is really a Targaryen. I think his father was Rhagar, and Eddard  promised his sister on her death bed that he would tell no one, because he knew that Robert Baratheon would kill the child if he found out, so he hid the child the only way he could, by admitting that he had a marital indiscretion.Theory II - In the end Tyrion will rule the Seven Kingdoms. I like this one, just because it has a Lord of the Rings feel to it. Kinda like, no matter how small, even a dwarf can do amazing things and save the world.Theory III - Eddard Stark is a green-seer and has really been alive this whole time, and he wakes up in a pool of sweat and it's all been a premonition dream, and as he wipes his brow dry he says, ""Winter is coming."" - close curtain.",1
"I got the book because of a recommandation and because of the cool quote.  I've read The Old Man and The Sea in High School and hated it.

"Robinson gets the science fairly right in this plodding sci-fi series, but the story he tells is largely unmoving and the characters themselves tend to the cardboard cutouts that are the bane of decent science fiction. The terraforming Mars idea has been done many times, and often better. This one, however, is longer.The best part of the series is the specifics of the science, especially in this first book. I agree with others that Robinson seems to run out of decent ideas in his sequels, often killing off characters, including some of the most interesting ones, for seemingly no purpose. Also, there is also a whole semi-immortality thing going on that eventually grows tiresome.BTW, having recently read The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury, I found that to be a far more meaningful work, even though the science itself was preposterous. Bradbury's stories have far more human truth, and are far more literary, than Red Mars and others of its ilk. And they come in at several hundred fewer pages.",1
"I have read so many bland and otherwise unbelievable historical novels that I was a bit skeptical when I picked up The Other Boleyn Girl. From the start, I was hooked. Using Mary, sister to Anne, as a narrator was as brilliant touch by the author, as she comes across as a vastly different woman with somewhat lesser ambitions, as far as having power and the throne in her grasp.Her sister? Power and ambition seem to be born in her and the author, Philippa Gregory, has clearly done her research, as I felt like I was seeing the world of the 1500s, so vivid, so real. Male/ female relationships were also clearly spelled out and I saw the Boleyn girls as the pawns they were in a very dangerous game of strategy to catch the eye of King Hentry the VIII. It was clear that men held the power and the women were meant to do the bidding of their families, especially if they could be used to help secure land, financial security or upward mobility in society.This may be hard for those looking at the events from a modern perspective but I think the author wasn't off base in her assessment of the times. She has certainly done her research because at the end of the book there is an extensive bibliography, adding weight to my assumption that here is one author who does her homework - and quite thoroughly.Although historical fiction can rarely be accurate as to what was ACTUALLY said at certain moments in history (with the exception of those times when reliable notes or tapes were taken), there can be a fairly solid recreation of the way people lived, the values and traditions. This is one of the strongest points in the book, as the author recreated the daily activities of each level of social class and showed how important (and even dangerous) it could be to catch the King's eye. I also got a feel for the foods eaten, the expectations for women (to speak many languages, learn domestic arts, how to act with propriety and proper manners) and little details like having hair combed with lice combs provided information about the realities that even the highest classes had to deal with (yes, even lice).Every detail of this book pulled at my emotions and imagination as well as providing historical information I hadn't known before.. When I wasn't caught up in reading about the various intrigues of the Boleyn family then I would be sympathizing with poor Mary as she was torn from her children or wondered how various women would fare later in history, not just the Boleyns but the Seymour girls. The author makes no bones about how women were used as pawns, devices in a dangerous game of ambition, scheming and desire to advance a family's reputation.I refuse to say too much about the plot except to note that I doubt few readers will be unmoved by the events described here. Also, you'll come away with a deeper appreciation for the history of the day, an understanding about how it may have played out in day to day life and women's life in the 1500s, as well as court intrigue, political scheming and much more. Richly detailed writing and totally engaging! .Related books:The Rise and Fall of Anne Boleyn: Family Politics at the Court ofAnne Boleyn",1
"Unlike some of this author's novels, Ice Station Zebra is an easy-to-read, quick moving story that doesn't bore. Forget the movie (except you can visualize some of the actors as you read since casting was well done.) The action aboard the submarine provides some tense reading moments.",1
"This was a great story! I found myself unable to put it down, completely immersed in the characters. And the ending was everything I hoped it would be.",1
This is one of the best books I have ever read. I was captivated by the first page. This book took me back to a time in history that left me in total awe of what the women of those times had to endure. Loved it.,1
"Absolutely the best, most wonderful book.  I'd highly recommend it.  The story is wonderful and the ending is everything you'd want it to be.I'm telling everyone I know to read this book!",1
"A timeless classic.  It is a very demanding and assuming title, but Gibran backs it up with some excellent style and content.  If he had the means to publish it a century or two earlier, he could have inspired a new religion.From the mouth of an old man about to sail away to a far away destination, we hear the wisdom of life and all important aspects of it.  It is a messege.  A guide book.  A Sufi sermon. Much is put in perspective without any hint of a dogma.  There is much that hints at his birth place, Lebanon where many of the old prophets walked the Earth and where this book project first germinated most likely.Probably becuase it was written in English originally, the writing flows, it is pleasant to read, and the charcoal drawings of the author decorating the pages is a plus.  I loved the cover.",1
Are they making a movie from this?  I'm waiting to hear.  Enough said.,1
"The story was good but had too many swear words for my taste. The circus storyline was very interesting (ie, how a circus works, what happens behind the scenes, etc). I was also surprised to find a good description of getting old. If you're interested in reading just that part of the book, skip the chapters with pictures at the beginning. In doing so, you'll also skip most of the foul language.I've given this book 3 stars, but it really should be 2 and a half.",1

"Ok...so it's book 5, read the other four so I'm hooked.  All in all a very satisfying read...but honest to goodness, one just never knows who Martin is going to kill off!I confess, there has been more than one occasion where I tossed down the book ( any of the 5) in frustration as one of my favorite characters was killed.If you like this series, book 5 does not disappoint",1
"I choose this book for the title and I had never read J. Patterson before.  The author described the main dective's inner thougts, emotions and his family conection in every chapter.  He is always looking for the answer the to kidnaping and not quite reaching it,  twists and turn keeping you wanting more.",1
"This is a dense, thorough scholarly tome -- not intended for the lay reader.  Those looking for more Flashmanesque romps should go elsewhere.  This book is to a PHD dissertation as Flashman is to Action comix.  Brilliant and fascinating, but not for the weak-willed.",1
"I wanted more details.  Is Bran going to continue to be a mushroom in a hole in the ground???  And did he try to contact Jon Snow through the crow?  What in the world has happened to Rickon???  Did Sansa get married, again??  Is she giving up her heritage??  What happened when Breanne was hanged?  Why isn't she dead?  Where did she lead Jamie and why?  Did the others that hung with her die??  How many people will come back to life?  Is there a possibility that Lady Lisa will come back to life just as her sister Catelyn did??  And how could Ramsay Snow Bolton be requesting the return of his &#34;wife&#34;, if he killed Stannis, that is where his wife and Reek went to??  Why did Theon become Reek?  And why didn't he spill his guts about not killing off the Stark boys while he was being tortured?  What happened to Samwell?  What happens to Arya?  And is all the vulgar language really needed?  A story can be indepth and well crafted without all the cursing, that is a choice.  Too many unanswered questions for me.  Is Mr. Martin going to drag this out into 100 books?",1
"I'm not an advocate of circuses, what with the animal neglect, so for Rosie to get the last laugh made me happy. The characters really jump off the page and you can really see what a hard life it must have been on the tracks.",1
If you are into historical fiction this book will not disappoint.  Engaging and entertaining for a quiet rainy day read.,1
Well written book. I like a book that when I am reading it I feel that I am right there.,1
"This Tom Clancy novel takes quite a while to slug through.  And not just because of the number of pages.  The author takes his sweet time developping the numerous plotlines in this book.  A little too much time in this reader's opinion. But the plots themselves seem so interesting that you do keep reading on, skipping perhaps a few useless paragraphs along the way.Clancy starts off with the destruction of the greater part of the American government body, and adds to that political turmoil involving Iran and Irak, biological warfare on the USA with the Ebola virus, and much more.  The only plot that starts and then goes nowhere is the one regarding the former vice-president who tries to discredit Jack Ryan's appointment as president. It's as if Clancy just lost interest in this matter or just didn't know what to do with it and just decided to let it die out, hoping readers wouldn't notice.In these times of possible war, reading such a novel makes you wonder if terrorists won't take some of the ideas presented by the author and actually decide to apply them.  A little scary.If you have a lot of time on your hands and enjoy reading political/military novels, then by all means read this book. If not, you might get annoyed by the use of every possible military acronym out there (and not all of them explained to the reader)and the very slow developping plot.  There are many more interesting books out there, some of them even written by Tom Clancy.",1
"A Dance with Dragons is the fifth book in George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series (on which HBO's Game of Thrones is based, with season one covering the first book).  It does not, however, follow the traditional pattern of picking up where the fourth book left off.  Rather, due to the fourth book ballooning out of control during writing, A Dance with Dragons picks up where the third book left off.  A Feast for Crows (book 4) was limited to the action in south Westeros and Braavos; A Dance for Dragons concentrates primarily on the action in the North, the Free Cities (not including Braavos), and Slaver's Bay.  Not until more than halfway through the book is a plot thread from the fourth book continued chronologically.  And make no mistake, the concentration is all on the North and Essos.  Only six chapters of the seventy-three total take place in the south of Westeros.  While this leads to greatly missed fan favorites being heavily featured (Tyrion, Jon, and Daenerys POVs combine for almost half of the chapters in the book), other fan favorites are almost absent (Arya, Jamie, and Cersei POVs combine for only five chapters).  There is no shortage of action and politics as Jon tries to prepare for the coming of the Others, Stannis and Roose Bolton maneuver for control of the North, and possible allies and ruthless enemies begin to converge on Daenerys.The split between A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons causes some issues (neither feels like a solid, standalone novel), but it makes sense not just geographically but in terms of an inflection point in the story.  A Feast for Crows in many ways wrapped up most of the major plotlines that drove the first three novels, while A Dance with Dragons features storylines previously on a side stage becoming the main show.  Martin appears to be well on his way to righting the ship after stumbling, and if the sixth book is weak, it cannot be blamed on its predecessors.  I personally rank the book above only A Feast for Crows in the series, but very close to A Clash of King (which is perhaps praising with faint damnation).For all of its good points (basically everything I don't specifically mention in this review), the book is not without its weaknesses.  The plot continues to suffer from a greatly reduced pace, lacking the breathtaking rush to climax of the first three books.  Much of the suspense of the story has subsided as well, and the climax is minor compared to that of earlier books.  This is probably unavoidable for a ""middle"" book, forced to worry more about transition than anything else.  What is not unavoidable are Martin's portrayals of the ""good guys"" in positions of leadership; they frustrate, as Martin continues to mistake justice for cruelty, honor for stupidity, mercy for weakness, and leadership for an inability to listen.",1
This is a funny book.  I was so surprized to see it could be used for Modern satire.  My husband and I have shared a few great laughs.,1
"Wow!! I thought this book would be like Robert Jordan and really slow but it wasnt. Daenaris is getting ready to take control of Westeros...its AMAZING!! And AEGON IS STILL ALIVE...great revalation!! But i have one bad thing to say...I know George rr martin likes to kill characters...but I felt so sorry for poor jon being killed!!! its really sad....anyway, its a good book. Youll never see what's coming in this book!!!!",1
"I really liked this historical novel; Jean Plaidy made the fascinating life of Eleanor of Aquitaine come to life.  From my own research, the novel is as accurate as it can be, and I loved the way Plaidy created motivations behind the actions of the historical figures.  It was well worth the read.",1
"This was a great book, the only problem was I finished it too quickly because it was so good!",1
"""The Winds of War"" and ""War and Remembrance"" must be read together. These lengthy novels follow the trials and travails of one American family through the years immediately preceeding the Second World War through to the end of that war. The author does a great job of depicting the terrors of the holocaust and of the ground war on Europe's eastern front. Likewise pacific naval combat is dealt with on a personal level. The historical context of the books seemed to be quite accurate. By the close of the second book the reader will have an appreciation for the cost of global war. Personally, I could have done with somewhat less of the romantic double-dealings and intrigue. My only other caution to the prospective reader is the daunting length of these books. I listened to the unabridged Audible Audio version of both books and found the narration to be excellent.",1
This was one of those books that caught my attention from the very start and had me continually wanting more. I can't tell you how sad I was to have finished this book so quickly! What an amazing read!!!,1

"Having been a huge fan of the PBS House of Cards trilogy on cable television, VHS, then DVD, since its first airing, I decided I had to own the DVD trilogy for myself.  Then I really got interested in author Michael Dobbs, and wanted to see for myself how the original written word translated into the screen versions I've enjoyed so much.  I was not disappointed.  Though the book and the screenplay different in detail (but what adaptation doesn't...) I truly enjoyed reading the Dobbs original.  This is brilliant writing!",1
"The Other Boleyn Girl was a favorite of mine to read because it not only provided me with rich historical references, it was a great storyline told from the point of view of a woman who was not held in the limelight.  Rather, Mary Boleyn was an unassuming girl, trying to find her way in the courts of high society, used as a pawn by her parents.  It was remarkable seeing the story through the eyes of a bystander.I enjoyed the rich themes of love and loyalty, the contrast between deceit and honor.  It made for a thorough read, an interesting tale.  The love between the siblings is juxtaposed with their simultaneous violent rivalry.  Amidst the brutality, this tale is a story about ambition.  Ambition for the Boleyn family in the time of King Henry's court.Read if you love historical fiction.  The story gets lengthy and somewhat repetitive towards the middle, but is still an amazing novel.",1
"I am so tired of first person narratives, so maybe my complaint about his book isn't objective. All the ""I, I, I, I,"" really got on my nerves. The movie was so much better because I didn't have to read the word, ""I"" anymore. The book also contains a lot of offensive language, which didn't seem to fit the era. The story line was interesting and moved along at a nice pace.",1
I had been waiting to read this for some time and our book club read it.  It arrived in a timely manner and in great condition for a used book!,1
"Loved every minute of it, couldn't put it down, can't wait to see the movieI highly recommend it, you won't be disappointed!",1
"Entertaining plot, engaging characters portrayed in sufficient depth.  I've not seen the movie, so I can't make that particular comparison.  But I can vouch that the novel stands on its own.  Makes me want to read another novel by this author.",1
If you like &#34;science fiction&#34; this is a book for you. It was just realistic enough. The characters were likable.,1
"Hemingway is a stickler for details, and it really shows in this book.  The story takes place over only 4 days time.It starts with Robert Jordan an American dynamiter who has joined with guerllos to fight the fascists.  He is led to a cave by Anselmo an old man, early sixties, where there is a camp.  Pablo is the drunken leader and Pilar is his wife.  Robert Jordan is very inner sociable, he talks to himself a lot, only when he is alone usually, it clears his mind.This book was truly amazing from the first word to the very last word.  Truly amazing, Hemingway is one of the best authors there ever was.  It would seem that he was actually there to get the details he put into this book, and you can actually see where he is and what he is talking about, and that is what the best authors do.Reading reviews on Amazon could not make this book any better or worse, so just buy this book and read it, I gurantee is will be hard to put down.Mark_Sigel",1
"I bought this book several months ago, but just couldn't find the time to read it.  I planned on reading it before the movie, of course that didn't happen and I was tried of friends talking about how much they enjoyed the book.  So, I picked it up during my spring break and couldn't put it down!  I'm not really familiar with Tudor history so I didn't have any background information to compare it to.  A couple of other reviews have called the book trashy and not accurate in it's historical information-I didn't expect it to be a accurate, it's a fictional account of King Henry VII, Mary and Anne Boleyn relationships.  I loved the trashy elements of the book and can't wait to read the sequel.  I've never been a fan of historical romances, but I look forward to reading some of her other books.",1
This book stays with you long after reading it.  I couldn't have been much better than this.,1
"Great summer read! Never saw the movie, but really enjoyed reading the book. Fell in love with the main character.",1
"THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST BOOK THAT I EVER READ, I LOVE THE WAY HE KEEPS YOU WANTING TO KNOW MORE OF WHAT HAPPENS. READ IT ALL IN ONE DAY.",1
"This is an excellent, well researched book.  The author obviously has a lot of empathy with the animals.  Descriptions of life on the circus train seemed genuine.  The ending that involved the elephant was a real surprise.  One criticisim I have is that all of Sara Gruen's books have happy endings.  I guess I'm just a Jude The Obscure kind of guy.",1
What can you say?  Different from the usual Agatha but masterful as usual.  Read it right away. Agatha fans will be surprised by this deviation from her usual but delighted with a fantastic story,1
This book is so cute and so much fun! We borrowed this book from our local library and then I just had to own it. My kids didn't want to return it to the library. The story line is so cute and it rhymes too which gives it a fun rhythmic sound as you read it aloud. Great book!,1
"Just read it, you won't be able to put it down. One of the best in the series, hand down.",1
"This story is a favorite among many Tom Clancy fans.  Chronilogically, this is the first story to take place in the &quot;Jack Ryan Universe&quot;, although it's only a two page scene where an 18 year old Jack discusses going into the Marines that we see the hero of the Clancy novels.The rest of the novel centers around CIA operative, instructor, and all around bad-ass John Clark.  We get to see what brought Clark into the CIA in the first place, as well as learn why is true past has been kept such a secret in the course of this story, which takes place during the '70s.Much of this novel is a story about revenge.  Picture a Navy Seal with a vendetta, and some of the outcome is obvious.  But what Clark is doing is highly illegal, and police investigators are closing in.  And Clark's expertise and military experience get him called in as an advisor, and later operative, in a daring mission to rescue POW's in Vietnam.Since he appears later, you obviously know John Clark survived.  But until you read this book, you don't know Clark.",1
"This was fun to read.  I didn't expect it to be anything like the movie and it wasn't, so I wasn't disappointed.  I could care less about Mali so I didn't stress out about his characterization of it.  I mean, you can't take this stuff seriously because he does say that the moon landing is a farce and that Stanton hated Lincoln (which was not exactly true, they had profound respect for each other)..  So I just went along for the ride and had fun with it.It is what it is...this isn't a book that will be in the classics section of the library but it was easy to read and a nice break from my regular tome.",1
I couldn't put it dowm. When at work I kept thinking about it and couldn&#34;t wait to get home to read!!,1
Thank you George R.R. Martin for giving me hours of pleasure and imaginative writing.  Please don't take to long to write Number Six.,1
"This book was recommended to me and I'm glad I read it.  It is not something I normally would have read but I did enjoy it.  I knew nothing about the circus and so was fascinated by the story.  I usually read family saga type novels so found this one not as easy to read.  It is, however, an excellent book and well worth the time and effort.  Very interesting.",1
"I loved this book.  An intriguing peek behind the scenes of a (fictional) circus in the early 20th century.  I thoroughly enjoyed it - well-paced, GREAT characters, and an interesting plot.  I highly recommend it!",1
"typical maclean novel filled with unique characters, detailed plot and surprising twists and turns. deals with the conflict in yugoslavia during world war II. kept waiting to learn if actor sterling hayden (a real life oss agent assigned to operations in this area) would make an appearance. same gripping type of novel in vein of 'the guns of navarone.' you become a participant in the story.",1
"The kind of Science Fiction that is an extrapolation from currently technology is difficult to do in a believable way, and this book does it well. It also features multiple characters with personalities and arcs that one ends up feeling to have met and known them as people in their lives. Want to get right on to the next one.",1
"This is a good story, but it is a little hard for a layman to get the drift of all the situations until you reach past halfway....then it really becomes interesting.  Great character descriptions and all in all a good read.",1
"This book is pretty enjoyable to read. It is not the most exciting book I have read, but it is not a bad read",1
"I read this book before the movie had ever been filmed and despite the movie being a fail, especially after reading the book, it is still one of my favorite books. It is so well written and every single detail keeps you wanting more. I could not put this book down and it is such a shame the movie didn't depict the book the way it should have. This is truly a classic and a must read.",1
"I gave When the Wind Blows a horrible review and had only read one other book by Patterson, which was a terrorist thriller of average quality, when I decided to bite the bullet and try this one out.Obviously some people really like his style and stories, so I figured this one, made into a movie, couldn't be THAT bad.  I wasn't too disappointed, in fact, since I expected it to stink, I was actually a bit impressed.If you're into chick written mystery thrillers, then this one will probably appeal to you.  I tend to enjoy more meaty offerings, Caleb Carr's great historical murder thrillers come to mind and Scott Turow's mysteries (lawyer based).  These types of books really get into the characters and don't rely so much on the ""hyper"" plot with out of the world, head line grabbing stories.This book makes the same mistakes that I found in the decent thriller Absolute Power, in which stuff happens that really could never happen.  I understand that is one of the points of certain types of fiction ""Blockbuster"" fiction, if you will, but it doesn't have to be so over the top.In any case, this one's a fairly quick read, and not a total let down, as for those that give this book the kind of glowing ""best novel ever"" type reviews, well, I don't believe those people have read much fiction.The cover of the paperback copy I read of this title had a glowing endorsement by Nelson DeMille, who is a superb writer, I'd recommend all his books before going to this series, but if you're a quick reader with lots of time, I'm going to give this an okay recommendation.",1
"Holy cow!  What a Book!  Here we have a novel written by a woman whose lead character is a young man, er... old 93 year-old man, er... an elephant named Rosie.  Never mind.  But she does it!  She pulls it off.  The story-telling is spellbinding.  You are right there in the blackness of night, wobbling precariously on the roof of a train crossing a trestle with a knife gritted in your teeth and murder in your heart.  You love Rosie the elephant. You ache with fear and infatuation for Marlene, trapped in the grasp of a lethal psychotic maniac.Sara Gruen is a literary gem to put us in the mind and depression times of the traveling Circus's, the smell of the animals, the freaks, and the language. How about fathoming the mind of a cranky, reminiscent 93 year old coot whose character and lovable humanity hold the whole thing together?So what's next?Pierce Scranton M.D.author, Death on the Learning Curve",1
I love the fire and ice series. Can't get enough. I am VERY upset that I have to wait so long for the next book.,1
Very good read. Keeps you wanting more. This book although Law Enforcement was once again on the wrong side of the Law it was with a very interesting twist.,1
"Worth the wait - not sure. A good read? Of course - classic Martin leaves you wanting more, hating him, loving him and thoroughly depressed over the inevitable 5 year wait (if we're lucky) until the next installment.",1
"I think Robin Hobb suffers from the same problem as Anne Rice.  If you use 3 sentences to discuss a frown on someone's face, I think you have 2 sentences too many.This book is not 'filled with action' as the  synopsis states.  There was hardly any until the last 75 pages (unless you  count all the times one character slapped another)!  It wasn't even until  the last 150 that I began to even care what happened to the main  characters.  Before that, they were simply objects acting out the plot.  Every one of them was so whiny or melancholy, I couldn't figure out why I  was wasting my time with this book.  *I* would have loved to be the one  doing the slapping.I would have gladly given this book 5 stars if it  would have had about 250 less pages.  I *will* read the sequel, but only in  paperback.Luckily, I have George R.R. Martin's new tome to occupy me for  awhile.",1
One of this author's best books.  I have read the book three times in the last fifty years and each time the appalling conditions suffered by men on warships and merchantmen alike jumps out of the page.  The conditions and tactics experienced by all the men involved are superbly drawn by MacLean.  One of my very favourite naval books.,1
James Patterson books are all great and thrilling especially in the Alex Cross series! You will want to keep reading with out a doubt! If you buy you will with out a doubt not be disappointed! Great book to the beginning of this series.,1
"I loved this story. About the circus. Not the sort of thing you usually find as a subject or background in a serious novel.  Characters are interestingly portrayed, and plot moves along quite quickly. This isn't Nobel Prize stuff, but a very enjoyable read.",1
This book was amazing. One of the best books that I have read in a long time. I was interested in a book that would keep my attention and this one definitely delievered. At the end of each chapter you couldn't wait to continue the book. LOVED IT!,1
"Every Herman Wouk book I have read has been incredible, but this one takes first prize.The Winds of War is a work of historical fiction about the lead up to the outbreak of World War II in Europe (it had, of course already begun in Asia between Japan and China and other Asian neighbors) and the effect of the war on an American military family.  It ends when America enters the war.  The sequel, War and Remembrance continues the story through the end of the war.The main character, Victor Henry, a Commander in the United States Navy is sent to Germany just before the beginning of the war as a naval attache in the American embassy.  He is the gruff career military man with compassion and love just below the surface and easily recognized by anyone except his family.  His wife Rhoda is a Washington, DC socialite who was captivated by Victor but is now restless in her life as an officer's wife.Victor and Rhoda have three children, Warren, the eldest who follows his father into the Navy and puts in for flight training, a daughter who is a less developed character and the aptly named Byron, a dreamer and a sensitive man who bridles under his father's influence and flees college to Siena, Italy, where he becomes an assistant to the American Jewish writer, Aaron Jastrow and falls in love with his daughter Natalie.Victor Henry has something of Zelig in him and is a bit player in many important events of the time.  He attends a weekend retreat of high-ranking Nazis and has meetings with FDR.Byron's employer Aaron Jastrow is a complex man, both running from his roots as a Yeshiva boy in Poland, and the product of those roots.  Natalie is a perfect picture of an American ex-pat woman living in Europe (first Paris than Italy) in the heyday of Americans living abroad.  And all of us can empathize with Byron, the young man who has not yet found his way in the world.All these characters are set against the backdrop of the precursor to war and the beginning of the war.  For instance, one of the best sections of the book is an extremely harrowing but vivid section in which Byron, Natalie and Natalie's lover get stuck in Poland as the Nazis begin their occupation of that country.The fact that Wouk can seamlessly weave this web of characters into the tumultuous time in the late 1930s and early 1940s is a testament to a great author.  Indeed, I am writing this review at least 10 years after finishing the book, yet it is all vivid in my mind.One final note that deserves mention:  Wouk treats us to several sections of a fictional book within a book.  After the war, Victor Henry translates a book by a German World War II general.  Wouk intersperses excerpts of this fictional book throughout the story, providing a seemingly totally realistic view from a German nationalist who fought for the Nazis (although was not a Nazi himself).A must read for anyone who would describe himself or herself as any of the following:  (a) a history or historical fiction fan, (b) a fan of epic romance, (c) anyone interested in World War II, (d) anyone interested in the Navy.",1
"This story is now in my top 10 best loved stories.  Now that says something!!!!Jacob Jankowski is a cranky but very likable 93 yr old man who lives in an assisted living center.He is strong willed and has opinions on so many of the other people who live in the centre with him. His body has degenerated and he doesn't want to look in the mirror any more as he does not reconise himself anymore.  He becomes the trouble maker of the group as his mind is sharp  not like his degenerated body.Jacob remembers the circumstances under which he found himself homeless and travelling with the Benzini Brothers Circus. He alternates between the past and his day to day living with his co-workers of the circus going weeks without being paid, and some nights some workers would disappear during the night (the bosses would organise for them to be thrown off a moving train). He sleeps on a horse blanket on the train floor just thankful for a meal and a job.1931 is a hard time during the depression and everyone will do anything just to survive.The world couldn't be any tougher for this young man.This is one of the most moving stories i have ever listened to on Audio cd.A must for everyones collection.",1
This book is a must read! I absolutely loved every minute of it. It is different yet keeps you reading. The characters are wonderful and the story is told with a great amount of emotion. Love love love,1

couldn't put it down. my husband would yell at me b/c i was keeping him up at night! Easy read!!,1
I really enjoyed this book by James Patterson.  This is the fourth book I've read by Patterson but the first in the Alec Cross series.  Very imaginative story telling.Must read for those who enjoy mystery stories.,1
You need to finish this before they write a different ending to the book. It will only work if you come up with something.,1
This is a book to escape into where you cheer for the good guy and hate the bad guy! A glimpse into another life.,1
"&quot;The Berenstain Bears on the Moon,&quot; by Stan and Jan Berenstain, is one of the best in the authors' excellent series of children's books. In this installment, Brother and Sister Bear, accompanied by their excitable pet dog, take a rocket trip to the moon and back.Although the book's primary purpose is entertainment and literacy education, the Berenstains do get some of the science right. The portray the gravity-free environment of the space ship's interior during the voyage, and they also show that the gravity on the lunar surface is much less than that on Earth.The book is illustrated in the typically appealing Berenstain Bears style. Particularly fun is the orange, green, and purple-colored rocket ship used by the intrepid space travelers. And the rhymes are equally fun. Example: &quot;Two little bears / and one little pup. / They are off to the moon, / going up, up, up!&quot; This irresistible adventure tale is definitely a high point in a beloved book series.",1
I love how these books flow and keep right on moving along.  These books never disappoint.  Now the very long wait until the next book comes out.  Loved this book!,1
"Completely different from any of her other books, this is the story of a psychopathic killer born to &quot;endless night.&quot;  Chapter by chapter, we see the desires and motivations of the character unfold.  Be prepared for an Agatha Christie with no detection, but spell-binding suspense that entertains completely.",1
A wonderful depiction of life in the circus world as seen through the eyes of a man who worked in one during the great depression. This story comes to life more strongly with every turn of the page! Gripping!!,1
"Loved the main character Jacob. Have to watch the movie again, but definitely don't remember this ending. Loved the author interview at the end also, so insightful as to how and why she wrote this book. Definitely have and will recommend.",1
"I loved this book as a child and now I love it for my own daughter.I have vivid memories of a time when I could just newly read and barely count ...staying up well past my bedtime, writing down all the words that were new to the dog (i.e. not counting ""a"" more than once) and trying to count them to see if the book really had 100 words (it did!).  It was that engaging.  I remember it took me hours, and then when my mom caught me still awake, I lied and told her I had just woken up.The point in that is that as a small child, I found this book so intriguing that I was reading, writing, and counting for fun, well past my bedtime.  As an adult, I love the wit.  As a parent, I love that I get to share the childlike love for it all over again.This is such a fun book with real learning potential too.  Love it.",1
"This is one of the best books I've read in years.  It had excellent character development and I had to keep reminding myself that it was fiction.  Since hearing about the dreadful Hartford circus fire from my mother (who had friends perish), I have always found it to be such an interesting topic.  This bridged the gap from story to reality by referencing some of the real aspects of the circus by utilizing that backdrop with an interesting storyline.  I cannot wait until the next book!",1
"Can fantasy get any better than this? I don't think so. Robin Hobb is one of the best writers out there and she vastly proves it in this trilogy. The idea of mixing seafaring high adventure (pirates included!) and fantasy is just another example of Hobb's mastership. The setting is spectacular: the world is, in general, ample terms, that of the Farseer trilogy; but while this latter's story is set in a medieval-like group of kingdoms and fiefdoms, the Liveship Traders trilogy is set far to the east of these, in the lands controlled by the city-metropolis of Jamaillia. This city is a kind of Byzantium or Rome, an ancient, sophisticated metropolis with a very complicated (and corrupt) political system, and several very rich colonies-satellites. Bingtown, where the main characters of the story come from, is one of these colonies and its commercial elite has survived the harshness of the dangerous setting by sheer strength, sharpness and will power...and by an extremely accute sense of honour that has always made them be true to their word and pay their debts (in &quot;gold or blood&quot;). This pride in their sense of honour has allowed them to keep strong links with their metropolis,  while trading in the most precious and costly of merchandise, a merchandise that hides a well-kept secret that has made them rich but for which a terrible price has had to be paid. The moral issues arise from the conflicts that the characters have to face in their changing and corrupt society, but the author is too good to hit us with these issues on the head -as so many fantasy authors do nowadays. And this is what is really glorious about the author: she manages to present her themes without writing an overly simple pamphlet about what is right and wrong. Because in times of change, they are not so easy to see.",1
"This is such a delightful story. I laughed, I cryed. I loved all the characters. It really gave you a peak into the lives of circus life and the difficulties they endure as well as the relationships. Great read whether hard copy or audio. I highly recommend reading it.",1
"Deep, deep breath. I have been among the legion of fans who have had to sit the entire wait of YEARS for this book. I got A Feast for Crows on day one, and on day one many years later came A Dance With Dragons. I really, really didn't want to read it. Bare with me, a review is coming, but to understand the hate and vitriol in the other interviews this explanation is necessary. Before AFfC, Martin's brilliant novels were running on fewer, tighter plotlines, and a major revelation awaited in each one. Often more than one major revelation actually. Then AFfC came out, and despite being warned, we all cried foul to see that many of our favorite characters simply weren't involved. So there we were, having finished a book that seemed to have shorted us a bit, with a promise of the next book to be delivered after a short wait. Six years later we get what is essentially AFfC part 2, with an addendum containing the beginning of the next book.We started this leg of the journey very angry with AFfC, and over the years, and delays, we became more angry. We began to lose hope that the series would finish at all. And if nothing else, that sort of passion and hopelessness should let you know just how amazing this series is at connecting directly into you. Expectations were high. Just four months shy of six years after AFfC it's here: A Dance with Dragons. And that six years is the problem...A Dance with Dragons brings back the missing characters from AFfC, and as it begins there is nothing to complain about. Taken as a whole the book is clearly the middle of the road between acts two and three of the story entire. Having that in mind I think you'll enjoy it very much. Especially if you are a true fan of the series. So those of you who are, and who may be thinking about not buying (you know you will eventually), go ahead and buy it. It's Martin. It's his writing, it's his characters, and it's the same world you fell in love with over the rest of the four books. Stories as long as this have parts that may not seem to do much, but that's because the major consequences of the things that happen in A Dance wont be fully known until the start of the NEXT book. Dance is the literary equivalent of the story slowing down to stretch it's legs for the sprint. But it being written by Martin, as long as you keep that in mind, you can take a longer view and realize exactly what it is he's setting up. And what he's setting up is a MASSIVE shake-up in nearly every political, religious, and even supernatural facet of the world he's made. He's laying the path for events that will change things to such an extent that I think it may turn out to be unprecedented in fantasy literature.Let that sink in for a bit.A Dance With Dragons features less epic style action, and more personal, small conflicts. It takes the characters away from what they know, and it puts them in the thick of places they might not even belong. It's a growing experience for each and every character in the book. The problem is that these new paths are not the end of old paths.You see we as fans have wanted conclusions to some very major story points, we collectively assumed that Martin wouldn't be expanding his story any further, only staying with what he'd begun and starting to wrap it up. He didn't do that. So all of us who were reading with baited breath to find out, for instance, about Jon's parents were left in the dark. We end a Jon chapter and find that a new character is being introduced, and it seemingly has nothing at all to do with what was hinted at before. This makes us angry.But take a deep breath. The reason we were all here in the first place is precisely because of Martin's writing. This man, undoubtedly, knows what he's doing. He's 5 of 7 into what I think is going to be recognized as possibly THE fantasy series for mature audiences. We should not be angry that he didn't write what WE would have written. It's not our story to finish. It's his. And you can even take it a bit further. Re-read the first books and you'll notice how many small hints are dropped about Valyria, then come back to Dance to find that there is now a journey TO Valyria. I believe he's trying to tie up more than just the stories of the great houses we've been following. I think he's trying to tie up the bulk of his entire mythos by the end. And read more. Notice that until Dance with Dragons we had no idea that there would be a SINGLE commander of the white walkers and the things beyond the wall (and that it may be the very one who is training Bran). We didn't know the people of the forests were alive.No, I think Martin is right on track. I think he's doing brilliantly. I think I'm more than happy to give my patience and trust in him not leaving us in a lurch.A Song of Ice and Fire will have an ending. Please just take a deep breath and realize how stupid it would have been of him to start tying off all those incredible loose ends with two more books to go. Westeros just took a deep breath (and I took one with it), the next book will be the beginning of the plunge, and the last will be the plunge itself.But this book. This one stands as a worthy addition to the story. It didn't go precisely where all of us wanted, in fact it spent a lot of time in a place that was as unpleasant for us as it was for a few of the characters in it. But there is a real sense of the slow beginnings of inertia near the end. When even more characters start popping in and when the dual storylines running parallel in AFfC and ADwD finally do end... you can feel it start to move. By the end I was left feeling that all of that spreading out of story and plotlines and character arcs was about to start converging. Dance, along with Feast, are very singular events in publishing. They only came about because we, the fans, demanded Martin not skip forward several years. We wanted to know what happened. And he gave it to us. The last two books were those written precisely so that we wouldn't feel cheated. Martin cared so much about fan outcry that he wrote two extra books. I for one am greatful. The more I read from him about this world the better.For five books now we've said it along with all the Starks: ""Winter is Coming."" By the end of this book... winter is here. And NOW the fun begins. Just don't take another decade to finish this George. Please.",1
The author painted a vivid picture of each character and moment of the book. The way the author portrayed the biggest moment of the book in at the very beginning became a shock at the end. Excellent read -- hard to put the book down.,1
"I read this book when it came out and it is everything you expect from Clancy, a very well thought out story line with lots of details, great character development, rich in sub plots and story.  Ok, he is increasingly leaning to the right of Rush Limbaugh, but that is kind of the charm.  Well, now comes the new global reality we have with the 9/11 attacks and wow, this book almost reads as a historical fiction book.  Ok, it still needs a little bit of faith on the readers part, but look at what is in the book, a presidential sex scandal, A passenger plane used as a weapon, biological terrorist attacks, and a President with a CIA background (ok wrong Bush but close).  All Clancy fans have either read this book or will regardless of the reviews here.  For those of you that have not read one of his I think given the times we are in this is a great start and will open you up to a catalogue of great fiction by Mr Clancy, his non-fiction is even not bad.",1
"This book is really packed and pretty. The pictures are great, but I think it could have included more desserts.",1
"In this, the final novel in her ""Queens of England"" series of books, the author weaves a tapestry of political intrigue, romance, and historical detail into the story of young Katherine Howard, the fifth wife of Henry VIII. A masterful storyteller, the author, who also writes under the name Victoria Holt and has a cavalcade of devoted readers, creates a work of historical fiction that will transport the reader to another time.The book details the rise and fall of Katherine Howard, a young, impoverished noblewoman of an illustrous family. As a young girl, she was sent to live with her grandmother, the Duchess of Norfolk, where she, unfortunately, fell in with a licentious group of retainers and became ensnared in two unsuitable affairs of the heart. Little did she know that they would serve to haunt her a way she could never have imagined.An opportunity, orchestrated by her Machiavellian and ambitious uncle, the Duke of Norfolk, arises for the beautiful, though foolish, Katherine to go to the Royal Court as Lady -In-Waiting to the fourth wife of Henry VIII, the kindly Anne of Cleves. Katherine obligingly goes. There, she falls in love with her cousin, Thomas Culpepper, a gentleman of the King's Bed Chamber. Her hopes of marriage to her handsome cousin are soon dashed, however, when she catches the wandering eye of the King, who loathes his current wife.Having charmed the King and having little say in the matter, Katherine becomes his fifth wife, once he divorces Anne of Cleves. Katherine's initial happiness as Queen is cut short, however, when her lurid past comes to light and is brought to the King's attention. This, coupled with her indiscretions with Thomas Culpepper, are enough to abruptly terminate her brief reign over England as its Queen and cause a number of heads, including hers, to roll.This is an intriguing blend of fact and fiction, which is laced with enough historical detail to satisfy those readers who enjoy historical fiction. It is with good reason that the author has a legion of devoted readers.",1
"I prefer Dennis Lehane, but this book was alright. A nice, quick read if that's what yo are looking for.",1
"This is a classic, country house murder mystery, and the first of the Alleyn mysteries. I really think Marsh is at her best writing this sort of English countryside whodunit. A weekend house party leads to a body with a ceremonial dagger thrust in its back. In the house there are blossoming relationships, some mysterious Russians, a secret brotherhood, and Alleyn is called in to investigate. The result is a fast-moving and satisfying mystery.",1
This is a slower moving story of one mans life back aroun 900 to 1000 AD.  I found it interesting and easy to follow.  By the time I was in about two chapters in I was hooked.  I was sorry to see the story end.,1
"This is such an awesome book- I bought it when it first came out (remember those scholastic book orders?) And I loved it.  I lent the copy to someone and I never saw it again.  I bought it again as an adult and loved it- finished it in one sitting and I recommend this for young adults and anyone older, too- a great read!!!",1
"George MacDonald Fraser, best known for the Flashman Papers, shows he can write conventional history just as well. He is familiar with the culture, geography, history and legends of the border region, and tells a complex story relatively clearly. The best sections are at the beginning and end of the book where he explains how the &#8216;reiving century&#8217; came about at the end of the middle ages as the people of the English and Scottish marches became pawns in wider political conflict between the English and Scottish crowns, and later how the age of the reivers was swiftly brought to a close by James I. In between the main conflicts are detailed in a scholarly and entertaining way, but the overall context suffers a little as the repetitive back and forth raidings of Maxwells, Johnstones, Kerrs, Armstrongs are picked over. The chronology of the period is a difficult one to master, and only those who are already familiar with the key border events of the 16th Century will find it easy to navigate this book. Overall though, a very good  history of the Border Reivers.",1
"The continuing story of Jack Ryan, now President of the USA, and the  trials thrown upon him by the leaders of the world.  Again, Clancy can  write a compelling novel, keeping track of his immense complexities with  ease, requiring his reader to follow to the bitter end to see the outcome.  The problem, again, arises in the very complexities he weaves:  Like life,  Clancy's novels have more people than can conveniently be kept track of,  and i am not one to set up a Rolodex file for the purpse of reading a book;  nor do i enjoy flipping back the pages i've read to rediscover who i'm  reading about; thus i find that all too often i have to read a sentence or  two of the new paragraph to be reminded just who the particular character  is, what their complaint about Ryan is, and what they are in the process of  doing about it.  All of which is not to say i dislike Clancy, just that  reading him takes a greater effort to keep track of characters than reading  anything less than the geneological lists in the book of Numbers.",1
"First, as the title of my review implies I *did* enjoy this book, and I *would* recommend this book.In a nutshell, it was a good story, put together well, well told, easily read with a good ending.  Nothing wrong there, but that's as far as it takes the reader.To those of you going into this book expecting the next great american novel, or ""the best book you ever read"" as I have seen more than a few describe it in other reviews, um.. no.  Not even close.I think all the reviews and even the critics reviews have done this otherwise very good book an injustice.  You will not find wisdom in it's pages, nor will you laugh/cry/etc (at least I didn't).So, if you go into reading this book with the expectation of a good read, you won't be dissapointed.  If your looking for something special, I just didn't find it in this book.In the end, my criticism isn't with this book, but all the incorrect accolades poured upon it.",1
"This volume caps Donaldson's amazing Gap series.  Those familiar with my reviews know that I don't lightly describe something as amazing.  This is easily the most captivating SF series I have read in years, and unlike many series, it does not peter out or become predictable in later volumes.As you would expect of Donaldson's work, the real story is about the characters and their flaws and struggles -- he takes us deep into the well developed personalities of each major character, and how they persevere, or fail, despite their weaknesses.The series is pretty cleanly wrapped up in this volume, with few unanswered questions left at the end.  If you've come this far in the series, of course you want to read this one too!",1
"Most of you know GMF from his Flashman series.  A few will have ventured into the McAuslan triology and from those tales gathered that Mr. Fraser is a WWII vet.  Well, this is his war memoir and a more sobering tale of battle, sacrifice, and stone-willed perseverance you will not find.  I could go on at length about the plethora of merits this book contains, but I'll pause to mention just one.  Quartered Safe dares to talk about the racism of war in politically incorrect terms and explain why so many veterans of the Pacific War came away with a hatred of the Japanese that was not easily quenched.  This is rough stuff and it should be required reading for all Baby Boomers through Gen X'ers.",1
"I saw the movie before I read the book. Wish I read the book first, it was a great read.",1
Loved this highly entertaining story. Very different from all the other rehashed story lines out there. Unique and wonderfully written.,1
"I usually don't read mass market, best selling paperbacks written by women. Nothing wrong with women writers I just don't read them. A friend at work asked if I wanted to read this book and her previous recs were mostly good.I really enjoyed this story. It was a nice change of pace.If you are a guy read this book cause you then have opportunity to see: What girls want in a man and why girls act like they do. That seems like a blanket statement but being a guy I would not have done many things the hero did and I couldn't understand why he thought what he did and was so against sound advice til I realized the author was a women and she was trying to write from a guys perspective. Of course what I have written may not be true and there are surely arguments against but I think I am right.I think you should read this book and am looking forward to the movie",1
George R R Martin never disapoints. Each book keeps you tied to your chair.,1
"Don't be fooled by the small size of this cookbook.  It packs many great recipes between it's covers.  From beverages to desserts with everything in between this is a gem for delicious mexican recipes, yet is feasible with a moderate level of culinary skills.  I bought the first book in this series several months ago and have been consistently pleased with each new addition.",1
"If you are looking for up-to-date information on the tanks of the world, then this book is for you.  You will even find information on the minor tanks of the world, not just the major countries equipment.  Spend the money and get the scoop.",1
"Jane Goodall does an excellent job in describing how she started her career as a zoologist and humanitarian worker. She gives excellent descriptions of how chimpanzees interact as family members, how they feel like people do - and what people can learn from them. Her book makes us readers aware of how close animals can come to how human beings feel and act, and that man is by no means far superior to animals. It also gives us an incentive to appreciate animals and to respect them. Obviously, Jane Goodall observes and then accurately narrates. Even in the shadow of man, animals develop healthy, and man needs to respect that.",1
Absolutely loved it!  Couldn't putit down til the end.  Always wanted to see the movie but now am glad I read the book instead,1
"Fifth of the Martin series, continues with intrigue and unexpected twists.  Can't wait for book six!  Hopefully sooner than later.",1
"A must have if you are a collector of this series. The continuing saga of Game of Thrones, highly recommend!",1
"Has Mr. Donaldson written the fantasy story to end all fantasy stories? Perhaps. But I'll still read other stories.This series is phenomenal. The depth and scope of the story telling is as good if not better than Tolkien. If you like Tolkien you should love Donaldson's Thomas Covenant series.Some people have trouble reading Donaldson because he uses big words and because of this his book is criticized. Too bad. Grab a dictionary you sloth. Not you of course, I mean the other person behind you who is bad mouthing this story &lt;grins&gt;.Each night I read a little more and each night I cared even more about the characters than I did the previous night. To me that is one sign of an excellent story. When it was all over I was saddened that Mr. Donaldson hadn't written a third series. But I hear rumours that he might. One can always dream.",1
"I'm a new fan of Jonathan Aycliffe and &quot;The Matrix&quot; is thethird novel of his that I've read this year.  The first two, &quot;TheTalisman&quot; and &quot;A Shadow on the Wall&quot; were more tightlyplotted and ultimately more satisfying and frightening.  &quot;TheMatrix&quot; seems to wander through a series of horror storyset-pieces, e.g. the claw marks on the apartment door, the violationof Catriona's grave, the sucker marks on the hero's body, withoutreally connecting them together in a way that satisfies and makessense. A new character, Father Silvestri, pops up toward the end ofthe novel and juggles our hero out of the fire a la Dr. VanHelsing in a Dracula novel. Then he dies, and we never really learnwhat group he belonged to or why he was trying to save Andrew from theNecromancer. Yet another new character, an evil book seller isthreaded into and out of the story's climax without really helping towrap up the plot.  It made me wonder if &quot;The Matrix&quot; had aprecursor or a sequel where some of these seemingly extraneouscharacters are introduced in more detail.At any rate, Aycliffestill manages to write a horrifying although rather discombobulatedstory about a young, recently widowed doctoral student who is slowlydrawn into the web of an evil Necromancer.  There are some nice Gaelictouches, brooding Scottish scenery, and a pilgrimage to the stifling,ancient landscapes of Morocco.  I'm in violent agreement with theother reviewers in that this author should be much more visible on thebookshelves.  He writes a more frightening story than any of theauthors in the Buckets o'Blood school of horror fiction.However,I'm glad my introduction to Jonathan Aycliffe was through &quot;TheTalisman&quot; and &quot;A Shadow on the Wall&quot;.  &quot;TheMatrix&quot; unravelled into too many loose ends: Why were thoseflapping, tentacled thingies in the Andrew's attic?  How did they getthere?  Who was the baby in the coffin with Catriona?  What purposedid it serve?  Where did Father Silvestri learn about the Necromancer?How did he die?  Why did he show up so late in the plot?",1
"If the first few paragraphs can't hold my interest, I can't read a book. I couldn't stand to put this book down! I could visualize throughout the entire story. I hated for it to end.This book far exceeded my expectations.",1
"Well written, but a little heavy on moral judgment. Not my favorite, by far. Six more words according to Amazon.",1
"The Prophet, for me, is a very vivid yet dense book. It speaks some sort of wisdom, and I delight in that wisdom when I can understand it.The illustrations are done by the author himself, which is nice.",1
"1) Plot (5 stars) - After two celebrity children are kidnapped, hard-nosed but savvy detective Alex Cross is brought in to solve the case, only to run into an intelligent psychopath and the myriad twists and turns he has waiting for him.  Patterson got famous for his plotting skills, and his mastery of this element shows in this work.  The pacing is fast, the tension is constantly high, and the surprises keep on coming.2) Characters (4 stars) - Alex Cross is not just a Dirty Harry, he is also thoughtful and sensitive and perceptive.  Gary Soneji is not just a raving psychopath, he is also a calculating enigma.  Jezzie is not just a simple love interest, she also has a mystery of her own.  All these characters could have been one-dimensional and the story would still have worked.  But they weren't, and for me that really elevated this book above the ranks of the traditional thriller.3) Theme (2 stars) - This book is so much about the charging plot of trying to solve a kidnapping mystery that messages or morals really take a back seat.  There did seem to be one, though, about how the lust for fame will make people do crazy things, as personified by the villain, but this theme wasn't explored much deeper than the surface level.4) Voice (4 stars) - Yes, Patterson is an easy read.  But (at least in this work) I didn't find that skill of easiness to come with the usual trappings of 8th grade diction and clich&eacute;.  His sentences reflect the POV of the chapter lead, and they do a great job conveying the mood and characters' psyche while also telling a fast paced tale.5) Setting (4 stars) - Washington DC is the locus of events, but the action seeps out up and down the Eastern Seaboard.  Patterson does a good job describing each scene in just enough detail to transport you there, but not too much to slow the ride.6) Overall (4 stars) - The main reason you read a Patterson novel is the plot, and that element doesn't disappoint here.  But I was also pleasantly surprised by the depth of the characters and the prose.  I'd recommend it.",1
"This is an outstanding cookbook and a must for any avid Thai cook. My wife is Thai and when she saw this book, she was shocked to see some recipes that she have not seen (and had) since she was in Thailand many moons ago. I was very impressed and very delighted with this book and I strongly recommend it. The recipes, if carried out to the letter, are authentic and worth trying.That said. The book is too large and bulky to carry with you to the kitchen while you are preparing dishes. Additionally, the pages are glossy and for sure you don't want set it on the kitchen counter. In order to preserve the book condition, it is best that you write down the recipe on paper. I am not deducting any points because of this incovenience though I wish to take off a quarter point for that.Overall, I am very pleased.",1
"I'm not sure what drew me to this book, but upon reading the opening chapter I immediately downloaded it and was engrossed. In the Dustbowl days in Canada, Robert's younger brother Matthew has gone missing. When a mysterious stranger appears in town and makes miraculous promises, Robert is the lone skeptic. Driven to find his brother, he continually searches for answers.While the prose was beautiful and the characters were vividly painted, it was the element of mystery that made it such compelling reading. I really enjoyed this book and will look for more from this author.",1
One of the best books of the genre I have ever read.  Read this book!,1
"Feel like I have to read this as I've read the others in the series.  Pretty boring though.  Not much action, just furthers the story line of 3 of the main characters.  Yawn.",1
"I've had this book for two years and only just read it last week.  Why did I wait so long???  This truely is a gem.  You feel like you know all the characters, and the ones you don't know so well are introduced with enough hints and inuendos that you can easily imagine their colorful pasts.  I fell in love with the elephant.  She brought a wonderfully odd twist to the story.And as for the author, I was half way through the book before I paid attention to the jacket picture and realised that it was a female. She wrote exactly as a man would tell the story.  The elderly Jacob was perfectly portrayed.  She has obviously been around very old people and knows how they act and react to all kinds of situations.I truely did not want the story to end.",1
"I loved this book, very entertaining, easy to follow, enjoyed this book and can't wait to see the movie. I want to read more of her books.",1
"I started reading ""Water for Elephants"" on a Saturday night and before I knew it, I had read half the book in one sitting. Sara Gruen's protagonist Jacob Jankowski, carries you through the novel - both as a twenty-three year old who just walked out of his Vet exams and onto the Circus arena and as ninety-three year old man stuck in a nursing home. Gruen's flawless ability to capture Jacob's voice both as a young and old man are is one of the many strengths of her talents. The storyline, which is composed of coming-of-age, love and well a circus will draw you in and keep you till you eyes read over every last word. ""Water for Elephants"" is a brilliantly, well-written and engrossing story that will appease to both men and women alike.",1

"I've been a passionate fan of the Song of Ice and Fire series,  just loved,  loved,  loved the first 3 books.  When book 4 came out,  I reread the first three and then dived into the fourth,  but it didn't quite work for me. I thought that this 5th book,  the putative second half of the original 4th book,  might work better. But I didn't reread the entire series and found that I had forgotten too many intricacies and felt like I was a at a party where I had to be reintroduced to all the guests who were all starting to blur and look alike.SPOILERS AHEADIt took me 600 pages till I actually got into the book. That's just ridiculous,  I know, but there were too many threads I just didn't care about (I'm looking at you Onion Knight) I have to say,  when I found out that Davos would not be killed but instead sent on a mysterious mission,  I was ready to throw the book away.  I was angry that I was continuously set up to expect the worst and then it not happen.  No important characters had any natural repercussions to their actions.And it was a square dance,  I felt like we were just doing same steps again and again.  I started skimming through the Tyrion chapters. Tyrion!  My previously favorite character!  I hated the part where he met the dwarfette and performed with her.  Just hated the character he was becoming.I liked the last 300 pages,  but for no other book would I have stuck it out till then.  But for all its shortcomings,  I am hopeful that book 6,  if, when it arrives,  will get the plot moving forward again.",1
this is a great book really informativenice pages and great recipesthe price was very good and it hada great selection of recipes in a wide range offood choicesaz,1
"Soooo disappointed there is no book 6 or 7!  Sounds like another Auel in the making, waiting years for the next book.Still I will buy the third season video.",1
"Unusual subject matter enlightened me about a topic I knew nothing about.  The characters sprang to life in an era when the circus travelled by train and the lives of the performers were creative in their means of existance.  Hard and cruel, tender and loving, I fell in love with the characters including the elephants!  A great read.",1
I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel. The author does a great job of holding the readers interest by flashing back and forward. I never felt a lull in the story.,1
"WATER FOR ELEPHANTS by Sara GruenMay 15, 2008Rating ****   (4.5/5 Stars)There was a lot of hype surrounding this book the year it came out, and I usually don't like to read books like that until the fuss has died down a bit. A friend sent this to me and I finally found the time to read it (plus it was also a group read). The book definitely does live up to its reputation, and I will most likely list it as one of my favorite reads in 2008.WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is the story of a man, who now in his golden years, is reminiscing about his past and his days with a traveling circus. The book goes back and forth between the two time periods, the present and the past (Depression era), and I think it was done quite nicely. Jacob Jankowski is the narrator and old man that is looking back on the eccentric life he had with the circus, about the people he met and knew, and the woman that changed his life. While Jacob sits in the old folks home, his mind wanders back to those days, often confusing the present with the past.His past takes us to his story of how he ended up with the circus, just a few college exams short of a degree. His future was to be that of a veterinarian, but that dream was cut short when his parents die suddenly, and he doesn't have the focus to continue. He loses the family home, loses his bright future, and has nowhere to go. Luck brings him to the train that carries the circus from one town to another. He hitches a ride, and thus begins the adventure of a lifetime.The reader will discover that this book is not really about the circus. Yes, most of the story line does take place behind the scenes of a circus, but what WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is really all about is loyalty, friendship and love, and the relationships that Jacob develops during these years with the circus. Comparing Jacob's current life in the seniors' home to what he had in the circus is almost akin to that of a caged animal being locked up. Jacob's time in this seniors' home is stagnating him, and he continues to look back at his younger years with longing. He remembers all that had transpired, his relationships with his fellow circus entertainers and workers, the circus ringmaster, a cruel and dangerous man who had his gentle side, and the ringmaster's wife, Marlena, who is in a way imprisoned in a marriage that she can't get out of.  In the middle of it all is a gentle elephant named Rosie, who becomes an integral part of the circus and an animal that Jacob takes under his wing. It is Rosie's relationship with several of the main characters that helps tell the story of these people, leading back toJacob's present state and where his last remaining days on earth will take him.I highly recommend WATER FOR ELEPHANTS. It's an insightful story about people, in an unusual setting.",1
"George R. R. Martin, &lt;strong>A Dance with Dragons&lt;/strong> (Bantam, 2011)It took seven years for George R. R. Martin to finish, and release, the long-awaited book five of A Song of Ice and Fire. (Longer, actually, as it was originally intended to be a part of &lt;em>A Feast for Crows&lt;/em>, so it's conceivable that some of the prose in this book is eleven years old.) And, let's face it, &lt;em>A Feast for Crows&lt;/em> was by far the weakest link in the series so far. So perhaps I was a little more reluctant to pick up &lt;em>A Dance with Dragons&lt;/em> than I would have otherwise been. In case you're a fan of the first three books who's been on the fence about it as well, I'm here to tell you that while this isn't &lt;em>A Storm of Swords&lt;/em>, it's absolutely a return to form for Martin.We pick up a number of threads we last read about in 2000 (probably not coincidentally, the threads most favored by fans); Tyrion's, Jon Snow's, and Dany's. We also get a couple of new threads, minor characters elevated to main character status, most notably Reek (whose identity remains a mystery until about halfway through the book, but you know him). Two-thirds of the way in, we pick up the threads from &lt;em>A Feast for Crows&lt;/em> as well, and get reacquianted with the rest of the Lannister clan, Arya, and a few others. As for the plot, if you've been reading along, you're well aware of it, though the action shifts from the War of the Five Kings (which seems to be petering out) to focus more on the east, with a number of prospective rulers realizing that gaining Dany Targaryen's alliance could mean the balance being tipped in their favor. Problem is, Dany has more than enough problems of her own.There's nothing I can tell you about &lt;em>A Dance with Dragons&lt;/em> that I didn't tell you about the first three books in the series. Fast-paced, action-packed, with excellent characters in interesting situations. It's wonderful, scurrilous, bawdy, majestic stuff, and if you haven't yet discovered it, give it a try. The books may look menacing (this is the second of them to top a thousand pages), but trust me, they're quick reads, and absorbing as all get-out. This is good stuff. **** ",1
"My love of GoT started with Season 1 of the HBO series. After the season ended, I immediately picked up Book 1 of Martin's series. Wow! While the number of characters can get overwhelming, the level of intrigue and suspense surrounding each one is addictive! I'm pleased at how closely the HBO series follows the storyline of each book, and that those variations that do occur add to the story, don't distract or take away from it. As a person who doesn't consider myself a big Sci-fi fan, I give this series of books an enthusiastic thumbs up!",1
"I realize this is a fictional account of court life during the reign of King Henry VIII given from the POV of Mary Boleyn, younger sister of well-known Anne, but enough facts are included in the book to make it all the more fascinating.Mary, a young recently-married teen, is depicted as the innocent pawn put into play by her calculating family with hopes to gain the attention of the young, virile king and secure a higher position for the family. Court politics decree that Mary is better suited for the task as she is already married and once the king has tired of her she can return to her husband. However, an unmarried maiden taken mistress would be &quot;ruined&quot; and unfit for marriage once discarded. What's more, Mary's husband doesn't dare speak out against the arrangement. Instead he must freely give his wife to the king and is compensated with a new title and land. The children she has from the &quot;royal union&quot; bear her husband's name. How generous.And that's only the beginning. The book abounds with the constant rivalry between the sisters coupled with the unbreakable bond of familial unity, all witnessed within the setting of the strictly choreographed and often corrupt court.As fascinating as it is to peek into this amazing world of court life with all its intrigue and outrageousness, it's also interesting to read about Mary and to follow her as she matures into a woman who discovers true happiness in the simple pleasures found with a loving and beloved spouse and children, free of the choking ambitions imposed on her by her greedy, power-hungry family.Overall a delightful, hard-to-put-down novel.",1
"Having never have read a work by this author or for that matter a fantasy  written by a woman, I was simply blown away by how SOM drew me in.  This  book turned out to be a page-turner for me.  Even during the scenes with  Malta which were for the most part I considered teenage girl problems I  found myself flipping pages faster than fast food establishments turn out  hamburgers.  SOM's most attractive feature is that it is a dramatic sea  going adventure full of pirates, traders and their ships, and yes sea  serpents who also have a quest of their own (though not as richly detailed  as of yet).  The richness of the characters developed is simply spectacular  and I don't believe that to be an understatement.  The concept of the  liveships is handled quite nicely as this could of turned out to be silly.  The liveships interact with the characters both physically and emotionally  so that you really care about them.  While reading I drew an analogy to the  voidhawks of Peter Hamilton's The Nights Dawn Trilogy and the liveships in  SOM.  Of course this is fantasy, but if you are not a fan or have not read  a book of this genre, I think that Ship of Magic would still be a very good  read.SOM has some very grisly scenes that animal rights activists would  not be too happy about and that their is also human suffering described in  uncomfortable detail.  Of course the word fantasy tends to imply happy, but  some of the material in SOM is disturbing.Never the less, I did enjoy  the book and am looking forward to reading Mad Ship.",1
"You can also read my review here: [...]WOW! This book has been sitting on my bookshelf for longer than I care to admit. Something about it drew me in enough to buy it but there always seemed to be something else that I would rather be reading so, it sat and sat and sat. I am so glad that I finally challenged myself to read it because it has to be one of my favourite books in a LOOOOOOONG time. What a great story.While I know that the book is a work of fiction, it really did feel like I was right there, in the circus, with Jacob, Marlena and August. I could see each of them (and of course Jacob was as yummy as Edward ~Robert Pattinson~), I could touch the animals, hear the music and feel the crunch of the peanuts beneath my feet. I loved that each of the chapters started with a picture showing the history of the circus because it brought me to the right time frame in my mind. The movement between Jacob as a 90 (or 93) year old in a nursing home and Jacob as a man in his early 20's were seemless. In some novels past, the 'current' story seemed forced and very out of place but here, it was a welcome part of the story.Overall, I feel like this is a book that anyone would enjoy. Whether you are an adult, a child, a tween, a senior, this book will delight you! It is a fast, fun read. Please pick it up and spend some time aboard the train with the 'Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth'.",1
"I kept seeing my grandmother in this story, not in the experiences, but the frustration with her body failing to last as long as her mind. She has all the spunk and none of the ability. She questioned the care and cost, as she was struggling to survive a health scare recently. The wisdom that comes with old age is now often disregarded due to the loss of physical ability,",1
It was perfect for my kids! They wanted a book with lots of pictures of tanks and they were very pleased! It was the perfect size and keeps them busy looking at it amd asking Dad lots of questions!,1
This book was recommended to me by a man who can trace his blood lines back to the Vikings. I was very pleasantly surprised by how entertaining it was. The author has a wonderful sense of humor that turned what could have been dry history into a very entertaining story. I loved this book.,1
I enjoy historical fiction and this work was exceedingly believable. Very credible dialogue in the story given what factual information I am aware of.,1
"I  got my first copy of this book back in 1961. It was one of the first printed (very old at that time) and was in a scroll type layout. I have since bought three more over the years to give to friends. If you are interested in Bible study, Give this a shotGREAT",1
"Resentments are brought on oneself, most often.  I bought this book after going through ""A Feast of Crows"" and re-reading A Clash"" and ""A Storm,"" suffering through the interminable waiting.  I, like many of you, was happily excited on learning that ""A Dance"" had hit the bookseller's shelves.  But then, now about half way through the book, the expectations have turned to resentments.  And some of this resentment can be fairly laid at the foot of Mr. Martin.If I met the author on the street my question to him would be, ""Why are all your characters in ""A Dance With Dragons,"" stuck in aspic?  Why are they all seemingly incapable of getting anything done?  They go here, they go there and back to there and here again like music CD's permanently set on ""repeat.""Maybe it is just moi but I don't think so, as other reviewers have touched on the same frustrating development.  Is it because a decision has been made to extend A Story of Ice and Fire to at least seven volumes, readers be damned, thus the necessity of stringing things out and out and out.For some unfathomable reason I guess my expectations concerning ""A Dance With Dragons"" were way off.  I had thought we would start to see some resolution for at least some of the characters.  Instead we get more Saturday afternoon matin&eacute;e.Alas!",1
Another book that kept me up into way too late each night.  I would have loved to read more historical info behind the circus and its hype in the 1920s and 30s.  This was an amazing book and I loved how it was told from present day in the eyes of someone who had lived it.,1
"I liked this book a lot.  And there were parts where I couldn't wait to find out what happened.  The book went back and forth between the 1930's and present time.  And I couldn't wait, sometimes, to see what the next part was.Then, I went to a book club and the people fawned over the book -- especially the incredible research, the way the employees and animals were treated and the shocking ending.  Well, that made me like the book less.  I don't care how wonderful the research is, if it's not written well.  And a lot of the things that the author wanted you to feel sympathy for, I just didn't.  I'm sorry that Camel got Jamaica giner paralysis, but he was a horrible alcoholic and addict who would drink anything to get a buzz.  Something was bound to happen.  And the way the employees and animals were treated -- was that really a shock to anyone?  Did people not know that?  Animals were always abused and it was the depression -- not paying someone and throwing them off a train is not unexpected.  And the ""shocking"" ending.  Gee whiz -- a 4 year old could see that coming.  ***SPOILER NEXT*** From the moment the author mentioned that the circus was in town and that Jacob's people always came on Sundays, I knew they woulnd't show up.  ***SPOILER ENDS***.So, I liked the book, I liked the story.  I didn't like people all ga ga over facts that should be common sense.  This book should be read as a work of fiction (as it is) and just enjoy it for that.",1
"The best part of this book was the portrait of Stalin.  It's hard to write about historic figures -- whether it's Lincoln, Hitler, or whomever, they usally end up sounding wooden or cliched.  Yet here, the author &quot;gets  into the head&quot; of Stalin.  Reading it I felt, yes, that must be  exactly what Stalin thought and felt like.The rest of the book is fine  too, but Stalin remains the &quot;character&quot; I remember most.",1
"After Black Ajax the idea of an essentially serious Fraser novel is a little less strange; when this came out, though, it was viewed as a definite anomaly in the middle of the Flashman series.  It's an excellent,  grown-up book that rings some interesting variations on classic western and  innocents-abroad archetypes-- in some ways the answer to H.L. Mencken's  famous jest that Henry James could have been a really great writer if only  he'd gone west instead of east to Europe.The straight-shootin'  ex-cowboy at the center of Mr. American is, for all his supposed outlaw  background, ultimately as much of an innocent as one of James' flowery  young debutantes.  Having made his pile out west (by means rough and tumble  but less vicious than all the Londoners like to imagine), he goes to Europe  to find refinement, culture, and-- he imagines-- the decency that life out  west lacked.  Of course he finds the exact opposite in an Edwardian England  that is morally rotten and on the verge of the greatest iniquity of all,  the mad self-destruction of World War I.  Fraser does a beautiful job of  making Mr. American simple enough to be disillusioned yet not so naive as  to be comical; this is a fine, intelligent read, and-- though this is  hardly the highest measure of a novel-- with its blend of John Ford and  Merchant Ivory, such perfect movie material that it's hard to imagine why  some aging star like Eastwood or Harrison Ford hasn't snapped it up and won  an Oscar with it.",1
I wish the next book was out I hate waiting for the next book.... it takes a look long. The show is just as good or better than the book series.,1
"This was, simply, the best mystery/thriller book I've ever read.  Constantly kept me guessing, surprises around every corner, and superb characterization!Alex Cross was especially moving, and Gary Soneji...well...though not my favorite bad guy, he certainly is the most clever I've ever seen.I liked the shifting viewpoint; you know, first person Alex Cross in one chapter, then third person somebody else in the next, and back and forth and so on.  Also, the very short length of the chapters was especially useful--I hate chapters that go on and on and on so you can't finish them in one night.I am verymuch looking forward to Kiss the Girls; I hope to finish reading all the Cross novels before the next one, FOUR BLIND MICE, comes out in November.And as for the movie, don't blame them!  This novel was HUGE, with LOTS of events and plot and scenes, so it's no wonder that they had to cut so much of it in order to cram it all into a 2 hour movie!  Blame the production company!  Paramount, I think.  In that case, there might have been at least a LITTLE justice.  The movie did fairly well considering how much of the plot it was able to get from the book...okay, maybe not a lot, but enough to make it's own story!!Oh, and my only problem with both book and movie, I don't get why it was called ""Along Came A Spider"".  I mean, I know where that phrase came from, but how does it fit into the novel?  It's never explained.  Oh well, maybe I'm just a crackhead.",1
"Oscar Wilde is a genius. His social satire is as crisp and hilarious as it was when it first appeared. He is one of the very first literary loves of my life. (I was reading his stuff before I even understood many of the references, while still loving his sharp language and witty repartee!) This is an excellent collection of his works - really well-done and well-edited. I highly recommend him.",1
"I first read this book back in the 1990s when it came out and it's always stayed with me so I decided to re-read it and see if I likedit as much as I remembered. I did. This is historical fiction at it's best. The writing is excellent. The story moves at a good pace and is well told. Mehuru, an African slave, and Frances, a white British married woman and Mehuru's owner, fall in love. The book begins with their two separate stories until they merge when they meet. Another major plot point, besides the slave trade, is the drive of Frances's husband to improve his station as a ship owner and trader of goods (including humans) in Bristol, England in the 1770s. A wonderful mix of politics and romance. A very satisfying read and very sad what the whites did to the Africans all in the name of money. Perfect for book groups.",1
"Overall, I enjoyed reading it but with some serious misgivings about the book.I'd say the biggest flaw in the book is the sheer number of characters.  There are just too many characters I don't like.  And by don't like, I mean I find them boring, not that I don't like the way they act or their personality.  Plus, Martin spends too many pages just describing scenery and what kind of clothing people are wearing.  Too much of the book feels like padding only there to fill in some pages.The series itself has now become so long and the story so complex that even though I've read every book in the series, I've lost track of who some of the characters are.  Some chapters feature characters that I have no idea who they are or what they're doing.Nothing gets resolved in this book.  No major plotlines have come to a conclusion.  We still don't know who the Others are or why the dead are coming back to life.  And that was a plot point featured in the prologue of the very first book!  The whole book just feels like a swimmer treading water, just keeping his head above the ocean and not going anywhere.To sum it up:Some very good and interesting characters and stories in the book.  But there are just too many boring patches and too many characters I don't care about.I wish this book had been the final book in the series.  Not just because I don't want to wait another 5 years for the next book but because the series itself is becoming so long and complicated.  If the next book comes out in a year or two I'll probably get it.  But if it takes longer than that forget it.I give it a 3 stars out of 5 rating.",1
"I haven't read ""Nikita,"" but this has the best of both the Dragon Tattoo novels and Shibumi.  Patrick is very much Dragon Tattoo's Salander in her distorted view of the world and competence; and every bit as much Trevanian's Hel in Shibumi--an idealistic hyper-competent assassin.  In neither case is it possible to predict plot twists, but both have satisfying--but not perfect--outcomes.  I kept turning pages....On the distaff side, Burnell could  use a good editor.  Grammatical and spelling errata have gone unchecked, which is awkward to notice in reading a novel.  And descriptions occasionally get far more detailed than I could follow without a map; the book doesn't  have one.  Over all, though, I'll read more of his work.",1
Reaching Out: The Three Movements of the Spiritual Life  - Henri J. M. Nouwen - This is a great resource for anyone studying this kind of material,1
"Number 4 in the series is another good read.  The interesting relationships among the characters continues to keep me buying the next volume in the series.  However, I really feel like the real stars of the show are the ships themselves.",1
"I haven't read much historical fiction. What comes to mind recently is ""The Terror"" and ""Pillars of the Earth"" (both excellent). I would put this one in with those. This was one of the fastest-flowing, impossible-to-put-down stories I've read! The surprises and strange situations were endless but plausible. I won't go on about the premise of the story but this was a highly recommended read. The amazing part is that the facts are indeed true. I've already ordered the ""Queen's Fool"" which from what I understand is the next in order.",1
"This is much more than a cookbook and rightly deserves it's title. Many people associate Mexican cooking with tamales, tacos and burritos which is no surprise as many of the Mexican restaurants in the US limit their menus to such items. This book goes beyond what Americans consider traditional Mexican cooking and highlights many of the recipes derived from their Spanish ancestors, executed with local ingredients.This oversized book is separated into regions and includes recipes as well as detailed information on the country. There is an extensive chapter on seafood including some excellent recipes which shouldn't come as a surprise since Mexico boasts a 6000 mile coastline. Extensive photography is also included in this book making it a suitable for anybody. If you can find a spot for it on your bookshelve, buy this book!",1
These books are a real treat.  I have read them over and over again.  It's amazing how much you pick up re-reading these books.  There is so much detail in every one.  I really hope he continues this series,1
"On the back cover of this paperback it's noted that Hemingway is known for his ""terse"" sentences. Did the person writing this ""blurb"" read the book? Probably not. In parts of this novel the author writes as if possessed by James Joyce, in a stream of consciousness style with long sentences. That's OK, or would be, if they added to the novel but, sorry, they don't. The author is also repetitive, repeating the same point over and over in some cases. But there is no reason in terms of the plot in writing the same point over and over in this book except to (in my opinion) stretch this novella out into almost 500 pages. The first couple and the last couple of chapters are essentially where the action is. One has to ask why this story is so revered and I think the answer is because the author was so admired. The press especially hero-worshiped Hemingway and perhaps this explains the too-much praise for this work. Still, not a bad book and when it's good, it's very good.",1
Loved the book from beginning to end. Great story with awesome characters. Couldn't wait to start the next one. Word,1
"This novel, written in the 60s, is not, in my opinion, one of her best. The three stars, however, is a Christie rating. It is still better than a lot of modern mysteries out there. My main problem was the vagueness at the beginning of the book, which led to temporary confusion as to who the third girl actually was. The writer Ariadne Oliver is also a vague character (and annoying). Christie does a valiant job trying to reflect the Beatnik era and obviously did her homework on the drugs du jour. Still, the overall work lacks coherence. Like Poirot, I was well and truly stumped (much time is given to the detective's mental processes). When the ins and outs of the mystery were finally revealed, much of it seemed far-fetched. I much preferredSleeping Murder, a Miss Marple mystery, andThey Came to Baghdad.",1
"I had a copy of this book thirty years ago, and loaned it to someone.  Never got it back.  After I read it again, I was as pleased as I was back then.  Adventure, gold, comrades in arms -- if you like this in a Viking setting, you should enjoy this book.",1
"Hemingway is one of the best known authors worldwide and with good reason. As someone with limited knowledge of European history and a complete ignorance of the events of the Spanish Civil War, this had me engrossed and wanting to learn more. It had me so engrossed that I nearly wanted to go join a rebel movement and dedicate myself to war a la Robert Jordan.This book has the vital ingredients of sex and war and mixed together with Hemingway's unbelievably creative writing style, makes for one of the best works of fiction of all time.",1
"If I had to recommend a single Hemingway book that would probably be this one. It's not your typical early Hemingway, and that's not a negative critic. The book is emotional, some passages are just really impressive. I think it's the one I preferred of all the books by Ernie that I read.One thing that makes this book special is the direct speeches. If you read this book you will not fail to notice a certain touch of 17th century in the way people speak to each other. I thought I would explain the reason for this as it is not self-explanatory for people who are native english-speakers. Spanish is a language where you have two forms of second person, ""you""; as in french, and formerly English. This is the difference between the ""you"" and the ""thou"", which is used in this novel. Formerly, the ""you"" was the polite form, and the ""thou"" the familiar form (not the religious form as many might think since the only use where you actually hear it anymore is for religious stuff). So whenever you see ""thou"" being used in the novel you know it means familiarity, as in old english. If I remember correctly, Hemingway also uses turns of phrases in such a way that it makes them sound ""latin"", the way it would be done in Spanish, which is the goal. This is a bit weird I have to admit but you'll get used to it, just keep in mind it's used to approach more closely the reality of the Spanish language, and thus have a better ""translation"".Worth reading.",1
Excellently written and completely absorbing.It's one of those rare books that has no part you will want to skim over or read through.The characters and the story linger in your mind long after you finish reading the book.The book itself is so good that it is easier to read than the best reviews here.,1
"The novel which inspired Graham Greene, John le Carre, Alfred Hitchcock and Ian Fleming (who described it as It opens with Charles Latimer, a mystery writer, navely accepting an assignment to discover who ended the life of criminal mastermind, Dimitrios. In doing so, he gets drawn further and further into the murky, corrupt world of the deceased: a man for whom war offered so many opportunities, he had no objection to helping start one. As our narrator crisscrosses World War II Europe, reconstructing the life and death of the great manipulator, he quickly learns that everyone who knew Dimitrios, is even less savoury than was the man himself. By now he knows he's been set up, and that he'll be lucky to escape with his life, but what he doesn't know is why.This is a taut, gripping espionage thriller, with lashings of intrigue, paranoia and double-dealing, which has held up well this past seventy years. Containing certain parallels to today's uncertain times, I feel this novel may well be set for a revival.A definite recommend for people who enjoy character driven tension.[...]",1
Great book I loved it and the way the author incorporated the old Jacob and the young Jacob was brilliant,1
"Most of us think of Elizabethan Britain as a reasonably peaceful place. Shakespeare and Marlowe writing plays, Edmund Spenser writing ""The Faerie Queen,"" Sir Francis Bacon inventing science to replace natural philosophy, the English Renaissance.However, there was one part of Britain that underwent continuous terror and warfare, the Borders. The area lying around the border between Scotland and England was an almost lawless place. Great numbers of the people inhabiting the Border Marches lived by despoiling each other. The 16th Century was when great tribes feuded continuously among themselves, when robbery and kidnapping were everyday professions, when raiding, arson, murder and extortion were an important part of the social system. This had little to do with war between the two countries, who spent most of the century at peace with each other.  Much of the raiding was not cross-border, but rather English attacking English and Scots stealing from other Scots.  It was a way of life pursued in peace time, by people who accepted it as normal. The seamen of the first Elizabeth might sweep the world's greatest fleet off the seas, but for all the protection she could give to her Northumbrian peasants they might as well have been in Africa.While the monarchs of England and Scotland ruled the relatively secure hearts of their kingdoms, the narrow hill land between was dominated by the lance and the sword. The tribal leaders from their towers, the broken men and outlaws of the mosses, the ordinary farmers of the valleys, in their own phrase ""shook loose the Border.""  They continued to shake it as long as it was a political reality, practising systematic robbery and destruction on each other. History has named them the Border Reivers.Fraser explains, in very well written words, how the situation on the Borders came about. He describes the manner of people who lived there, who were the leading robber families, how they lived and ate and dressed and built their houses and so forth. He tells how the reivers practised such crimes as the protection racket, robbery and cattle rustling. He also explains about the feuding that went on. He describes how Border law operated under the March Wardens and how the two governments tried to quell the reivers. Lastly the book tells how the reiving ended when England and Scotland came under one king, and the older Borders ceased to be.",1
"I really enjoyed this book.  I had seen the movie first, and had great expectations for the book.the only negative thing i have about it was the terrible editing it was like it was hurried onto the kindle, or the software had a bug in it - lots of the letter ""i"" missing from the middle of words, every time the word ""thanks"" was written it was missing the ""h"" (tanks).  also lots of 1/2 and 1/4 in the middle of sentences for nothing, and sometimes numbers replaced letters or vice versa.Apart from navigating through annoying roadbumps of typos, the actual story itself is quite touching.there is also a lot of differences from the movie, but i can see where and why those changes were made to get it on the big screen.",1
"The book's title refers to the first circle of Hell in Dante's Inferno.  This is the least oppressive level of Hell.  The prison camp described in this book offers plenty of food to the prisoners, no backbreaking physical  labor, and a warm bed.  Most of Stalin's prison camps are located in  Siberia where the prisoners freeze and starve.  What accounts for Stalin's  leniency?  The prisoners are scientists working on top secret projects like  a telephone for Stalin's use that can't be tapped, and a system of  identifying anonymous voices on public telephones by the voice prints,  similar to finger prints. In Stalin's evil country, you are not innocent  until proven guilty.  You are guilty as soon as you are arrested.  One  prisoner was put in jail because his neighbors wanted his family's  apartment and made up an unsupported lie about him.  They got the apartment  and destroyed his life and family.  Most of the prisoners were WW2 vets,  POWs returning from Germany.  They weren't welcomed home with appreciation  and honor.  They were lured home by lies, and immediately  imprisoned.There are many great characters.  You'll remember Nerzhin and  his wife, and wonder how things will work out for them.  You'll remember  Rubin, the sincere communist caught in the web of the system he believes  in.  You'll remember Innokenty Volodin, in trouble for doing a good deed,  as innocent as his first name.  When you read a mediocre book there are no  characters to remember, just a predictable formulaic storyline and a group  of people and events you find hard to believe. This is a rare opportunity  for you to be a fly on the wall, halfway around the world, observing life  in a Russian prison camp.  The reason I give it only 4 stars is because I  like happy endings and resolved problems.  This book would make a good  movie.  There's plenty of room for a sequel (which hasn't been written)  where we can find a satisfactory ending for some of the characters.  Stalin  the insane sewer rat died eventually and was denounced by Khrushchev, so  maybe in time these people were allowed to live out the rest of their lives  in freedom.",1
Very interesting history of circus life.  Could not put this book down.  Wonderful story filled with flashbacks of circus people and environment.,1
"There aren't too many books that both my husband and I find impossible to put down, but this was one. The combination of human drama, adventure and historical detail were extremely compelling. We absolutely loved this book.",1
"I have always loved James Herbert's books, and although I have read this book before, reading it again reminded me why I adore this man's books. The build up of wrongness creates a tension where you feel as if you can shout at the characters to turn around, something bad is coming, but yet, you take every step with them. I love the character of Ash, the turmoil within him which makes the story so much more scarier. The author's ability to describe so vividly a place or situation where you can actually picture it your mind (the classroom for example) is another reason why I enjoy his books. As with the first time, I absolutely enjoyed and loved reading the book again.",1
"This is my first book by Barbara Erskine but if given the chance to read another I will certainly do so. I found myself thoroughly loving (most of) the characters and certainly the locale of this book. I have a fascination for books that take place in Egypt; so mysterious, so old.  In this tale Anna Fox is recently divorced and is feeling totally diminished by an ex-husband who used her as nothing more than a social secretary.  Encouraged by her aunt she takes off to Egypt to follow in the footsteps of her somewhat famous great-great grandmother, Louisa Shelley, a water-colorist. Louisa has left a diary of her experiences and a mysterious scent bottle.The story is told in three parts; Anna's current day adventures, Louisa's Victorian tales and the mystery of two Ptolemaic priests who are looking to reclaim the scent bottle and it's ""Tears of Isis.""  The three stories are seamlessly bound together as Anna starts seeing the sames visions of the priests that Louisa did.As Anna reads Louisa's diary and becomes more involved in Louisa's life she becomes more afraid of the ghosts of the priests. In her current world her new acquaintances on the cruise ship in Egypt including two men who both want different things from her -  including Louisa's diary - try to woo her for their own purposes. Just who can Anna trust?This was a fascinating book with a good story at its core. I enjoyed Anna's present and Louisa's past. Anna's relationship with Toby (one of the two men) was fun and well developed. The other man, Andy was not as well developed and he seemed a bit one note but it didn't detract much from the overall book. I found myself turning the pages wanting to know what would happen to Anna and what did happen to Louisa.",1
"Quite a writer, vivid characters, lots of war, lots of killing... character development excellent, never boring .. made into HBO series",1
"Guy Gavriel Kay's ""The Summer Tree,"" the first in his Fionavar Tapestry trilogy, is a satisfying trip into classical fantasy that sometimes moves slowly, but rewards readers willing to become emotionally attached to the story and characters.The Fionavar Tapestry tells the tale of five young people who find themselves pulled into a fantasy world. At first, just experiencing the strange land is enough to keep them busy, but soon they discover that they are at the center of something bigger. Great evil has awakened and seeks to spread itself across the lands. Epic storytelling ensues.Mixing post-Tolkien influences with Arthurian legends and time-honored fantasy standards, ""The Summer Tree"" manages to stand up well on its own despite its clear influences, largely based on the author's strong writing. You'll see plenty of familiar characters with changed names - elves, orcs and the like - but it never feels like More Of The Same.Kay's prose is rich throughout, written with a cadence that almost begs for reading aloud. It is, admittedly, sometimes a bit much. At times he ramps up the weepiness almost to the point of pretension in a way not unlike Stephen Spielberg does in his films - yet it never drags the story down because he is such a fine writer, his characters are well-realized, and the story itself is interesting.Action buffs will find the story slow and are encouraged to look elsewhere for reading satisfaction, but readers who like the written word and who enjoy character-based fantasy written in the ""high"" style are encouraged to take a look at the first book in Kay's beloved series. This is epic, emotional stuff that is likely to stand the test of time with the best the genre has to offer.",1
"Alright, so I saw the preview for the movie Water for Elephants. The movie preview looks great. To be honest, I read reviews about this book and I had considered buying it at the store for some time, but thought it was a read I could do without. However, I am one of those people that usually has to read the book before seeing the movie. Water for Elephants is not a book I will remember for a long time and will be telling my friends about. The story lacked a lot of oomph and I didn't care for all of the sex. I will be trusting my instincts on books after this. I mean, movies usually differ a lot from the novel anyway, right? I will give Water for Elephants this: it was sweet concerning the elderly. I have a soft spot for the elderly, they've lived a full life and I found myself more intrigued with the older Jacob Jankowski than the younger Jacob Jankowski. I also felt as though Water for Elephants wasn't finished in some areas. I like closure, unless it is a series, which this clearly is not a part of.",1
"This is one of those books that I read because I loved the movie first. So, I was quite surprised when I read how the book begins - with the murder of one of the main characters. When I further realized that August does not own the Benzini Brothers, I began to see the movie as its own story separate from the book.Jacob is by far the most interesting character of the book, especially since he tells the story as an old man in a nursing home - and has the wisdom and experience to go with his age. His emotions are infectious and I longed to sit down with him and listen to all of his stories in person way before I finished the book.August is the kind of villain that is confusing in his evil deeds - he has schizophrenia - which makes it somewhat unfair to dislike him so much. His irrational behavior has been exploited for the almighty dollar by Uncle Al - but the real villain tends to fade into the background.Marlena is beautiful to the point of angelic, very little of what she does can be considered wrong in any way, as she is a victim struggling for freedom for most of the book. She approaches August's mood swings with the same caution due a wild animal, and remains faithful to him despite her personal feelings, and does not leave until he first betrays her. Considering how women today will leave their husbands for any reason, I admire her strong morals.The background is set during the Great Depression, which made for many intense situations as the circus struggled to profit, as well as the survival of the cast of characters. Though I studied this period in American history, the direct experience gave me a clearer idea of the desperation of people alive during this time - how easily morals could be put on hold for the sake of another mouthful of food or another coin in the pocket. So many men of the circus would work without pay for the promise of another meal and unending hope that life could still improve.Rosie, the elephant, is also one of the most fascinating characters in the book. She proved to be only one example of how animals were exploited to the point of cruelty for profit. I could not help wondering where the animal activists were.Needless to say, this book sparked many conversations and inspired many moments of personal contemplation for me. I loved this book, and I highly recommend it.",1
Great book.  Love to read but am an impatient reader.  If a book doesn't 'grab' me quickly - first two or three pages - I'm likely going to put the book down and may not pick it up.  This story reeled me in quickly and kept my interest and attention.,1
The book went deeper into the characters and what it was truly like to go to the end of the world in 1896 to try to find the gold that everyone was lead to believe was so easy to find. I find it very interesting and fun to read.,1
"As a fan of fantasy, this is one of the best trilogies I have read. I love that it's written by a Canadian author too! The characters are compelling. I couldn't put it down!",1
Water for Elephants is a love story set in a post depression traveling circus and told from the memory of 93 year-old man.  The story jumps between the current life of the narrator a uncontented man who believes he is 90 or 93 and his rememberance of the love story between Jacob and the Benzini Brother's circus.After the death of both his parents Jacob a veterinairian student finds himself penniless. Although not intentionally  he runs away to the circus where he finds love.This story give great historical flavor and is a must read.,1
I love all of the Alex Cross novels. They hold your attention with every page. I am working on acquiring the entire series. Definitely books I can read over and over.,1
"Red Mars is a classic story of world building in the most literal sense - it is the first volume in Robinson's tale of Martian terraforming, and the political and scientific implications of human colonization.  It is genuinely important, as it takes the possibility of human travel into space as a real thing, and not a fantastic bit of fiction. But the very realism of the story makes for a slow (albeit rewarding) read: Robinson spends significant time on the details, and his grasp of the minutae is overwhelming at times.  Nevertheless, the characters he creates - larger than life pioneers who echo the explorers of an earlier age - pull the story back when it threatens to become turgid.  Profoundly worthwhile for anyone who cares about the actual future of humanity and whether space travel will ever really happen.",1
I love Sydney Sheldon his books keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the reading.The intrigue will surprise you at every turn.,1
"I bought this because I started the Tawney man series from the same author, during the second book, I realized I was 'missing' some information on the liveships they were talking about. I had already read the Assassin's apprentice series and wanted the next series. I can't buy the last book of the Tawney man series until I finish this series.",1
This book still holds all the philosophical magic 70 years after Gibran wrote it.  He managed to distill some basic truths about life and they are as applicable now as they were then.,1
"As always, the book is better than the movie, yet the movie was good, too! The author tells a first rate, unique story that had me laughing at various points. There were also points I was in tears. Am looking forward to see what Ms. Gruen writes next.",1
"The chapters change characters so abruptly sometimes you feel like you missed something. Story will jump into the middle of a situation, then explain backwards, and back to the present. Seems written in a different style than the previous books, takes a little longer to read, but definitely worth it!",1

"This book is actually quite different from most of Ms. Christie's books.  We still get the same great characters and plot, and we see Hercule Poirot at the height of his powers, but it has a totally surprising ending.  It is also a really good snapshot of what the establishment thought of young people during the height of the hippie era.  The book starts with a young woman coming to Poirot's house and interrupting his breakfast.  She tells him that she thinks she may have committed a murder, and then leaves suddenly without saying anymore.  Poirot enlists the help of his friend Ariadne Oliver to try to track down who the girl was, and when they find out, they find a real ""mare's nest"" of a family.  Ms. Christie is such a wonderful author, and this book is certainly interesting, if different than most of hers.  She is still tops in this field, and each of her books is entertaining as well as written to get the reader to actually think.",1
"I enjoyed this book.  While, at times, I skimmed through quickly over the more violent parts, the book, as a whole was very satisfying.  The technique of telling the story of the past while relating the events of the present was interesting too.  I liked the ending.",1
"HARVEY PENICK'S LITTLE RED BOOK: LESSONS AND TEACHINGS FROM A LIFETIME OF GOLF is a must have for any serious golf library.  Filled with anecdotes, stories and practical golf advice, Penick's book is a forthright, enjoyable read.  No wonder these lessons had such an impact on the likes of golf greats Ben Crenshaw and Tom Kite, both of whom were Penick proteges.Penick's book also lends a classical look at a classical game.  With all that's going on in the world of golf today: the exorbitant salaries, conflicts about equipment and vintage courses becoming too short, Penick's book reminds us that once upon a time golf was a genial game instead of a rabid business.  Read it and gain some needed perspective on the greatest game in the world.THE HORSEMAN",1

"I'm a fan of the Song of Ice and Fire books, but I have to say, compared to the first three books, things are starting to take an ominous turn. If I was talking about the story getting darker that would be a good thing but, sadly, I'm not. Let me explain...In the early books, things moved quite nicely along. Plots were plotted, intrigues were intriguing and action was thick and fast.As the series has progressed, however, things have taken a decidedly odd turn, which I'll label, ""The Robert Jordan"" effect. Now I like Jordan's books, but at a particular point his Wheel of Time series ground to a halt and endless irrelevant characters were introduced for no good reason whatsoever. This is what appears to be happening to GRRM's Ice and Fire books. Irrelevant characters? How about Asha Greyjoy? Grinding to a halt? How about this very book!If one summarised what happened in Dance with Dragons, it would go something like ""Characters wander about a bit, the plot doesn't progress more than a hair's breadth and hoped for meetings and resolutions don't happen.""I wish I could be more positive about the book, but this is the first of Martin's works that I've actually started skimming paragraphs because I felt they were pointless and uninteresting. This is usually a really bad sign for me, since I like long, epic books and series. I like a lot of grist and fat to chew on in a story. But when that fat turns out to be rancid, I'll spit it out and give it a miss, thank you very much.There is also an increasing incidence of what I'll refer to as ""Time dilation"" going on. Martin will spend two hundred pages describing an unimportant trek for one of the characters. Later, another character seems to teleport from one place to another without any detail of the journey, whilst that same character elsewhere has other travels painstakingly detailed.The entirety of the book could be condensed down into three hundred pages or so without losing any of the substance or important details in the story.I've given this three stars, but that is more out of respect for the earlier works. I hope the next installment sh9ows a decline in Martin's tendency to pad things out.",1
"So, I was most annoyed about Martin's decision to divide his characters between two books separated as they were by geographic distance.In part my annoyance may have been due to not really liking the southern characters, and at the time I did not realise there would be a payoff - the next book Dance with Dragons would be ALL  about the characters I did like!Well for the most part, Martin still manages to meander around with characters I barely heard of let-alone care about, and for some the plot will still appear to be moving at snails pace.Still D w/ Ds rules. Martin's writing is crisp, and powerful seeming to have evolved over the sixish years he took to write this book. Obviously if you've read up to this one in the series you're probably going to read this anyway, I'm just providing a heads up this is a goodun...",1
"It's late summer 1909 in Liverpool and a Yank steps off the boat from America. Mark Franklin is an authentic Westerner, his luggage containing Stetson, saddle, gun belt and two .44 Remington pistols.I've been to England many times, and I love it. Unfortunately, my family's roots are not in the UK, nor have I had the longed-for opportunity to take up permanent residence there. In MR. AMERICAN, it's Franklin's great good luck to have made a fortune from a Nevada silver mine. This allows him to return to England in search of his roots - his forebears having immigrated to the Colonies hundreds of years before - and purchase the house, Manor Lancing, which dominates the Lincolnshire village of his ancestors, Castle Lancing.I learned in English Lit 1A that every novel incorporates a conflict, which, in MR. AMERICAN, is subtle. To modern fiction readers, fed a steady diet of lurid murders-most-foul, global conspiracies, and courtroom duels, it may not seem like much of a conflict at all. Author George MacDonald Fraser, a Brit himself, has chosen to introduce into Edwardian society of pre- WWI England a rugged individualist matured in the late-19th century American West, and develop what happens. The WASP values that Franklin possesses from such a background - chivalry, self-reliance, forthrightness, loyalty, lack of class pretension, suspicion of authority - are occasionally at odds with the upper class social circle that soon adopts him.For the reader, Mark will present as an appealing, stand-up fellow. The book is populated with interesting characters: Samson, Franklin's gentleman's gentleman; Pip, the effervescent West End stage actress; King Edward VII; Lady Helen Cessford, the militant suffragette; Peggy, the daughter of an impoverished country squire; Kid Curry, the unwelcome visitor from Franklin's ... um, shall we say, irregular past. And above all, there's the outrageous and aging rascal, General Harry Flashman, the hero of a whole other series of books by author Fraser.I was undecided for a bit on the number of stars to award this novel - 3 or 4. At almost 600 pages, it isn't the type of book that keeps one riveted. The dramatic moments are occasional and of short duration, and there are a lot of loose ends that would have made an absorbing sequel inasmuch as the storyline ends in 1914 with the outbreak of the war. (Since MR. AMERICAN was published in 1981, no sequel has been written to my knowledge. Pity.) In the final reckoning, I gave it four stars because it's about an American who finds ""home"" and adventure of sorts in a green and pleasant land. I'm envious.",1
"Although we don't know if the ""other"" Boleyn girl refers to Anne Boleyn, or her younger-by-a-year sister, Mary, Mary is chosen by author Philippa Gregory to narrate this book.  She is a close observer and participant in the Boleyns' schemes to advance the family during a period of turmoil as Queen Katherine of Aragon is unable to produce an heir to the throne of King Henry VIII.This is a very easy and engrossing read.  I think it's better enjoyed by lovers of historical fiction, but will be appreciated by anyone.The book begins with a teenage Mary, who is newly wed to William Carey and part of Queen Katherine's court.  Her sister, Anne, is being summoned from France, where she attended at that court,  so she may join her sister as one of the Queen's ladies-in-waiting, but really so that the family may make her an advantageous marriage.  At this point, ""Annamaria"" and ""Marianne"" are like yin and yang, frick and frack.  Not for long.As the ambitions of the Boleyns and the Howards (the family of Anne's and Mary's mother) to advance their place in society grow, Anne and Mary are set loose as rivals to each other at court for the sole aim of capturing the attention of the King.  The Boleyns sense, as do many other families (like the Seymours) that the Queen's inability to produce a son will open the door for one of their daughters to step in.Although Mary is married, her husband is forced by her family to take a backseat to the King as the King initially takes a shine to the ""golden-haired"" Mary.  The affair continues as she bears him two children.  There is a moment in the story when the King, who by this time has had a son and daughter with Mary (albeit illegitimate), privately expresses to her his belief that his marriage with Katherine was cursed and should be annulled.  Even though Mary knows that, during this moment, he is vulnerable, she just cannot seem to seize the moment and suggest to him that she step into Katherine's shoes.  Maybe she's prohibited by her undying (and inexplicable) loyalty to the Queen, or to her husband, or by her sense of right and wrong.  Or maybe it's just Mary's good sense as she knows what a risky and dangerous proposition that would be.The drama builds as Henry's court becomes more raucous, dangerous and intriguing, no thanks, in part, to Anne. The King eventually loses interest in Mary as Anne puts on the ""full court press"" to usurp Mary's place as the King's favorite, in part, out of jealousy, and in part, out of her growing impatience with the family's failure to marry her as she continues to grow older and less desirable.  Anne gradually gains the King's attentions as she has no problem helping him understand that Katherine must be put aside.  The more Anne grows in the King's esteem, the more ruthless she becomes in her ambition and demands.  I found it clever that the author painted Anne to be venomously ambitious and hateful throughout the bulk of the story, but by the end, you buy the author's premise that she got a raw deal.  Also by the end, I unexpectedly despised Jane Seymour more than Anne, even though Jane was painted to be no more threatening than a fly whereas Anne was mean and nasty.It is clear that the author adores Mary, so much so that she seems to suggest that England would have been better off with Mary as Queen, and that Henry would not have had any reason (because she was so even-tempered and had bore him a son) to toss her aside.I think the author gets into a bit of a jam by making Mary the narrator/observer because then she must make Mary important and indispensable to all the key players in the story.  For instance, even though Mary is supposedly despised by Anne, she is also called upon by Anne to assist her, of course, on the eve of every historical event (no doubt, so Mary can observe and talk about it).  Also, Mary, a mere mistress, seems to have the King's ear and counsel, even after their affair had ended, which is a bit awkward to the story.I do ultimately think that it was interesting, although imperfect, to tell the story from Mary's perspective, as it is notable that she was the only Boleyn sibling to get out alive.  She must have been an clever person to achieve that.Ms. Gregory has sold me on her ability to craft an engrossing historical fiction novel.  I just can't decide which of her books I'll read next.",1
I have read these books years ago.  I can't see as good as I used to and need to be able to enlarge the print.  Kindle allows me to do this; so I wonder why they are not on Kindle.  The Summer Tree is but it not available at this time.  Come on guys.  Why?Sandy S,1
"I came to this book after years of putting it off.  I was torn between reviews saying it's an essential classic of science fiction and reviews saying it's a dry over-technical treatise.Well now I have read it and I can say that it is both of those things, and more.  The book is split up into sections told from the perspective of different characters, charting the first 40 years or so of Mars' colonisation.  I was surprised at the variety between sections.  Some are tightly focused on the psychology of the colonists - on particularly engrossing section is from the perspective of someone who is barely holding onto sanity.  Other sections, however, are a bit heavy on technical descriptions of construction or Martian geography.  Political philosophy also gets woven through the chapters, but unfortunately much of it is 'told' to the reader through unrealistically long speeches.  The characters who chose to actually live their radical philosophy ... spend most of the book in hiding.I found the more human / psychological aspects of the book to be fascinating.  The technical and philosophical part of the book were indeed pretty dry, but easy to skim through if you get bored.But don't let that put you off: this book really is a classic of science fiction, and well worth the effort.  It's probably a good thing that I waited until I was a bit older to read this - I probably wouldn't have had the patience in my teens or uni years.  But I'm so glad that I finally picked it up, and I've just started to read the sequel.",1
Not to be confused with THE good Book. Typical eastern philosophy and good food for thought. I liked this book. I thought it was inspiring.,1
"Stark is a troubleshooter who has a specialty in recovery of things that people can't find. In this case he is tasked to find a scientist.However, it is not that simple, really, the City he lives in is very bizarre, indeed, with different parts being completely different and having completely different rules. As in rules of reality, more Cynosure or Wonderland than just the bad neighborhood or slum type of thing.Didn't quite work for me, but is not bad.",1
"This is a 300 page book which took about 200 pages to grab me. It felt like the first 2/3 of this book just created background, letting us know the various characters in the circus and giving us a sense of life in that traveling circus of the 1930s. All of this was well written and interesting, but there was not much of a story until the final 100 pages, or at least it never grabbed me until then. I didn't start to really care about the narrator until then. Those final 100 pages were great fun, and I loved the ending of this book. I recommend this book, but cannot quite give it four stars when I spent most of the book waiting for things to pick up. If you read this, just sit back and enjoy the good portrait of circus life in the depression. Don't be impatient, like me. Eventually, this picks up steam and delivers so well. The ending is one of the best I have read in so long.",1
"Definitely one of my least favorite Poirot books. As other reviewers have mentioned, the solution to this mystery is quite apparent about halfway through the novel. I sort of wanted to shake Mrs. Oliver and Poirot and ask them how they could be so obtuse and not realize the solution. The quirks our beloved Poirot typically display are all gone here; all that is left is rather dry prose and a mystery that should have been shortened by about sixty pages. Having said all of that, it does make for a quick read that does not require much thinking. If you are looking for a great example of a murder-in-retrospect book by Christie, I would recommend ""Five Little Pigs"" instead.",1
"'The Liveship Traders' trilogy fits in between the 'Farseer' tilogy and the 'Tawnyman' trilogy. If you have not read any of them, I highly recommend them all. This paricular trilogy may fall between the other two, but if you dont have time to read all 9 books, dont hesitate to pick this one up anyways, it stands on its own.The story revolves around Althea Vestritt, a woman who most think should be at home raising children, but wants to follow her fathers path as a liveship captain. She needs to defy tradition and take what is hers by rights. She will be thwarted by pirates, politics and her own family.Im a man, and sometimes have trouble getting into female characters, but not so with this one. Robin Hobb created a wonderful cast of characters with diverse and complicated personalities. Athea is beautiful but tough as nails, and I had no trouble getting into her storyline. There are alot of other characters you follow through out the series as well. All equally as complex. As with all good stories, sometimes you hate the good guys, love the bad guys, and sometimes cant tell wich is wich.  There is plenty of action, love, and intrigue in this series to make it a must read series.If you have read any of Hobbs writing, you know the quality of her work and will not be dissapointed.",1

"Water for Elephants follows two alternating storylines: the first traces the veterinary career of Jacob Jankowsi, a Cornell dropout who finds work with a little-known circus during the Great Depression. The second sees Jacob years later as a bored, temperamental old man in a nursing home. Having nothing but time, the older Jacob slips in and out of memories, mentally revisiting his days with the circus.The main focus of the ""circus"" storyline is the love triangle between Jacob, the circus's equestrian director, August, and August's beautiful wife Marlena, a performer. Although they all start out as friends, it soon proves to be a disjointed friendship at best. Despite his charming exterior, August is a two-dimensional bully prone to violent rages. Jacob, on the other hand, is relatively sane, competent though naive, and shares a mutual passion with Marlena (also somewhat two-dimensional) for the circus animals.The story has potential. Honestly, what's a more romantic setting for a love story than the surreal world of the circus? Unfortunately, the circus merely serves as exquisite background scenery for the main drama, which turns out to be nothing more than a predictable love story between two cardboard characters I could honestly care less about. That said, it's still worth a single read just for the background material itself.",1
"LOTS OF SPOILERS - warning!!!Best Sci-Fi TVI am currently dipping in and out of this book as I watch the new TV series.There are two great features of GOT, one each character has their own chapter, and 2) you are therefore follow individual story lines without reference to the rest of the book.While in the first book there was a lot of cross overs between the stories, now in book five,a whole bunch of characters are on very separate quests.This sunny Sunday it occured to me that this tome 5 was a bleak and depressing read.1) Daenerys is stuck with her 'rabbit ears', lots of political compromise and general married life misery2) Cersei and Marguery are both locked up awaiting trial, the first quite rightly the second more problematically3) Jaime wanders around the country breaking sieges, with compromises and promises4) Arya is off in Bravos - doing what - we're not sure, and its not relevant5) Bran is off North of the wall - doing what - we're not sure - and again the relevance is lost on me6) Jon Snow is having a miserable time dealing with a bunch of convicts sent north from Kinglanding, who seem set of having their own mini war within the wall7) Theon - & the Boltons Ramsey and Romsey - lets not even go there.Best Sci-Fi BookThe point of GOT if there was ever a point is that surely the Starks, and there were six children. One has to survive, win back and succeed as the new king - surely that has got to be the main point of this story.At the end of this book it feels like all the Starks are irrelevant or about to die?Which makes me think, why bother with book 8?Note to author, please can we have a happy ending, or something for the Starks?",1
"I've just finished reading this book and after reading some of the reviews, I have to say that this book doesn't get the credit that it deserves. At first, the book was a little confusing. Not in the storyline, but in the way the author wrote. But this confusion quickly disappeared very early into the book, and afterwards, the story was thoroughly enjoyable. The way the author portrays the main character in the story is fascinating!  It's like he slowly breaks down as the book progresses. And the ending is not one that you would expect. All in all, I think this book is an interesting look into the world of law from a lawyers point of view as well as a look into how a crime takes over a small town. Ignore the bad reviews and just give this book a chance!  It can't hurt.",1
"I don't think the actual plot of this story interested me as much as the incredible setting and description of circus life in the early 1900's. I LOVE the historic photographs at the end of each chapter because it allowed me to see for myself the life-style that the story was trying to re-create. I wasn't all that attached to any of the human characters, but I loved the animals and actually think my favourite character was the Circus itself. I was able to view the Circus as a living, breathing character of it's own, and that is honestly where most of my intrigue for the story came from. I was not prepared for the amount of sexuality and language in the story! It was completely distracting from the story and I was disappointed how often it would randomly be thrown into the writing. I felt it was almost always unnecessary...it did more to detract from the novel than it ever could have added. I suppose it was a wake-up call for me about the difference between young adult fiction and adult fiction. Had it not been for those two things I would have definitely rated the book a 4 or 5.",1
"I loved Water for Elephants. Author Sara Gruen managed to place herself in the head of both a ninety-year-old man with Alzheimers in a nursing home, and a twenty-three-year-old man who had a great life ahead of him until tragedy struck. She swung back and forth between the character's present drab life to the unpredictable depression era circus of his youth so naturally that I was amazed how often I forgot I was reading a book. I was so entranced by the scenery and story that it just flowed along like I was watching it, or more accurately, living it with the characters. It's not often storytellers do this good a job in our generation. I have recommended this book to many people. Gruen is a writer to watch.",1
Great book except that it's another cliffhanger. - Wish GRRM would pop them out a bit quicker.  Maybe it will come out when I retire.,1
Great Book - Keeps you guessing until the end. Several people and animals in this book to root for.  Love story is interwoven in the Circus World.,1
A believable rendetion of a time gone by.  Kept me reading late into the night.  Thanks for such a enjoyable read.,1
"Being an Atheist, it may seem strange to some people that this book holds any meaning for me, but I think that, despite the religious references, people from all walks of life will relate to the poetic prose of The Prophet.Kahlil Gibran has been greatly celebrated in several countries for the book's simple yet biting phrases. Any two sentences in this legacy of living can be made into a thought-altering quote.Gibran uses a prose style throughout. Short lines of words written as freestyle poetry create a rich medium to deliver his words.Each section has something poweful to say, but some of my favorites were those on Work, Giving, Children, Crime and Punishment, Freinds, Time, and of course Love.As oppposed to most books containing the word ""Prophet"" anywhere in the title, Gibran expresses life as something to be enjoyed and soaked in as many ways as possible. The book does not stress the punishment of sins, but to bask in pleasure and not look back. Decadence is not suggested, but the basic purpose of Gibran's legacy is to tell us that life is short and must be lived without regrets.It is a book that includes such beautiful metaphors and velvetty language that you are always sucked into reading ""just one more section."" What makes the book work is not just the simple genius of the author's statements, but also the beauty of his words, the flow of his language.I hate to be like everyone else (in more instances than just this), but it does change you. It states what any prophecy should, and allows the religious aspects of the beliefs to take the backseat to the love of life and aspirations.Buy, read, and live by The Prophet's words.",1
This book had a tiny bit of a slow start but once it got into the thick of things I couldn't put it down and I literally read the second half the book in a 2-hour timespan.  Such a great story I've made my husband (a veterinarian) promise me he'll read it!,1
"I thought I would never finish reading this book, and I would not have either if it wasn't for the fact that I needed to return it. Book five is a great read, but the series continues to just be wordy (go on and on and on). This book did not have Sansa in it at all, only three chapters with Cersei, and Arya in it. The characters came into the novel towards the end of the book. Bran has about five chapters before his character all together disappears from the novel about a third into the book ( I guess we will read more about him in the next wordy novel.  Many of the chapters consisted of several new characters that in my opinion could have been left out.  In book five, Jon, Tyrion, and Dany make up most of the chapters. In the end another of my favorite characters dies (the Starks don't favor well in this series).",1
"Even when you know how things will end, who will live and who will die, you still enjoy the story.  It's like viewing a good movie several times.  In this case there is even more wild intrigue and fast-paced action.  Morn survives (of course), the battles on the ship (between the travelers) are great, frenetic activity.  In the end, there was no big mystery, nothing really happened in a spectacular way.  The series did not exactly end with a whimper but instead, a long low sigh from the depths of space.",1
There are lots of surprising twists in this story including a final  surprise in the last sentence. MacLean did a very good job when he wrote  this book.,1
The book is over 800 pages and while the research seems through it is a hard read as one experience after another with many similarities described.  I found myself skipping parts to get to the meat of the book.  Seems very well documented.,1
"Following the rave reviews, I thought I would try this book (and the first one).It was ok.It was good on detail, but I just found it too easy to put down and not take up again.I struggled through the first, and then this one thinking that perhaps it would engage me the more I got into the story.  Unfortunately, for me, it was just not interesting enough.  A bit slow on the action, and the conversations seemed to be stilted and quite unrealistic.Oh well, given the reviews of others, it is worth a try, but if you don't like the first book, I don't think it is worth struggling on as I did.",1
"I loved this book. It was so sweet in an adult fairy tale sort of way. I enjoyed the characters, the description of the animals, the whole premise of the story. Long after I had finished, and recommended it to everyone I know, I still think about the characters, and miss reading about them.",1
"I put off reading this book for a long time as I got so sick of waiting for GRRM to crank any work out. When I finally broke down and bought this, I was reminded why I thought he was such a great author in the first place. I still sadly think he won't live to finish the series, but it's been a great ride so far!",1
"If you enjoy historical fiction, you'll love this book! I got so engrossed I found myself thinking inside the story during the day...when I'd been reading it in bed the night before.  The story is fast-paced and exciting, yet touching and real.I highly recommend this book.",1
I loved it!  I like mystery or crime stories and so now I want to read all of the Alex Cross series,1
"I probably would not have picked this book up on my own because I dont really care for circuses and the thought of clowns freak me out. This was a book club selection that someone else had picked, so I gave it a try. What I found was a story that hooked me.I was so terrified to read about any animal cruely, and to be truthful there is some of that in this book. However, I found myself not able to put it down.The story was more about someone who had chosen a path in life, and then when a devestating act occurs  changes that path to something totally differently.I think the whole lesson of the book is that life may be taking us one way, and then one little moment can change everything. That changed moment can even make us think that what we wanted was not what we really wanted after all.As for the animal cruelty, while I hate it, I had to say that it really did occur and probably still does occur in some circuses. Very hard for me to stomach, but at least the author put the truth in the book.I am not going to summarize the book. All I can really say is pick it up and give it a try. A definite entertainment. Also, for those not too crazy about clowns, well my doubts were not founded in that department. There is not really mention of them that I can recall.",1
"I have read all in this series so far, and this one was great. There was a lot of excitement in the plot. I can't wait for the next one. If you follow the TV show Game of Thrones, I definitely recommend reading the books.",1
"I bought this book for my husband.  Although long, he was unable to put it down.  He said it was a very good book.",1
"Read this book very carefully, especially if you are committed to reading all 20 volumes.  IMHO, it is the best book of the series. In book one (""Master and Commander""), I assumed that Maturin was a minor character who would not appear again.  I thought he was a gay geek, and that his mysterious, solitary, on-shore expedition was of a carnal nature; little did I realize the true nature of either Maturin or the trip.This second book focuses on developing the Maturin character as a spy; a sophisticated man of wealth, background, and education; a lifelong drug addict; and a nerdy womanizer - sort of an 19th century cross between James Bond and Bill Gates.Chapter 4 is the most bizarre chapter in the entire series.  I am still going on the assumption that the escape-across-France-in-a-bear-costume was really just another opium vision of Maturin's.The books that follow this one vary greatly in quality of plot; some are excellent, some seem to be virtually plotless narratives, but all are worth reading.  Still, book 2 stands head and shoulders above all the rest.",1
"This book blew me away!  Most books this size have at least one boring spot in them right,?  or a place were they go on and on about nothing. But Robin Hobb made every word, every paragraph something to savour!The  character developement in this book is the best i've seen yet, (except from  Lord of the Rings, but even then i'm not to sure). Wintrow and his  miserable situation was heartbreaking, but it was reality and thats what  most Fantasy writers forget about. I know your thinking ""well there's  a magic ship and pirates involved in the plot, how realistic can it really  be?"" But those aspects just give this book some interesting details,  yet give you situations that are enlightening and entirely life like. The  good guys don't have pure hearts or any of that junk, but they do have very  human motivations and ideas. PLEASE and i mean this sincerly!, read this  book, its a page turner and will give you something to read on those warm  summer nights, sitting on the deck listening to the crickets perform.",1
This is a book about lonely planet travellers and the unusual circumstances of a number of deaths. The book takes one to some far away places and through a murder mystery. It also provides simple lessons about the Internet and friendship that everyone should know. A good read.,1
"I absolutely could not stop reading this book & was sleep deprived until it was finished!  Then I could not stop thinking about it!  This book offers a fresh look at the tale of Henry VIII, Anne Boleyn, and the inner-tickings of Tudor Court life.  I have often been annoyed with other authors of historical fiction for taking situations that were little more than the pimping and selling of aristocratic young girls for family advancement and wealth, and turning them into romantic courtly love.  Gregory approaches the scheming of the Howard family with brutal honesty, and manages to realistically capture the confused feelings of infatuation, flattery, frustration, hurt, and love in an adolescent girl as she is preyed upon/courted, used/loved, and discarded by the King and her family.  I would also recommend reading the series on Josephine Bonaparte by Sandra Gulland if you enjoy non-stop action, emotional involvement with characters, and a realistic view of the complex personalities of dynamic rulers.",1
"This book seems to have gotten the same negative reviews as Feast for Crows, and I don't really know why.  I thought it was great!  It wasn't quite as awesome as the first couple books, but it still had me not wanting to put it down.  Yes, there were a ton of cliffhangers and the book didn't end really resolved on anything - but we should be used to that, it's just his writing style.  I agree with some of the people that there were a couple chapters that should have been left for the next book (mainly Cersei and Jamie) because they didn't really add anything to this story, but that doesn't make it a bad book.  It was exciting, a lot happened, and it isn't always what was expected.  Some new character perspectives, like Barristan, Asha, Melisandre, and Quentyn, added to the variety and it was nice to see things from some new perspectives.  I enjoyed reading this book and while I don't look forward to the wait for the next book, I am excited for the book itself.",1
Martin pulls one surprise after another and man a great many shockers in the last 100 pages. Bring the 6th book out please - can hardly wait,1
"A man in a nursing home relives his younger years as a vet for a circus. To this reader, not a very compelling premise, yet once I read the first paragraph I was instantly hooked. By the second chapter, I had grown so attached to the main character that I truly felt for the things that happened to him. The story is told in rich, vivid prose, capturing each character so well that they soon became my friends and enemies, depending on the character. This book addresses a wide range of human experiences in a tasteful manner in which this reader was left in a pensive, awe-struck mood contemplating far more important questions and ideas about human existence. It also needs to be noted that this book is extremely well researched and bases its story around actual happenings in Circus history.",1
What the heck George? What are you trying to do to me? I have invested my time and energy into these characters and them you kill them off like they are cannon fodder!!!!!I waited forever for A Dance with Dragons to come out in paper back. I was not disappointed. It kept my attention right from the beginning until the end....waiting for something to happen....and I waited.I cannot think of another author who can write a tomb of over one thousand pages who resolves nothing and leaves you wanting more. Where is the next book I want it now!!!I need to know who wins the Game of Thrones.,1
This recipe book is small and short but represents a wide variety of recipes. The pictures are beautiful and the recipes are clear. I love the inclusion of savory recipes.,1
"Agatha Christie wrote several novels that deal with international organizations trying to take over the world.  While I prefer her works set in the cozy country estates with families full of suspects, this is an enjoyable foray into this type of her work. Tones of neo-Nazism, drug trafficking, international finance, and a scientific discovery that could change the world are some of the elements that make up this story.The characters are interesting:  Sir Stafford Nye, an unambitious member of the British diplomatic corps caught up in this caper; his great-aunt Matilda, an aristocratic lady reminiscent of Miss Marple in that she has a remarkable memory of things that happened long ago; a young girl with three identities who fears for her life, and a young man rumored to be the son of Adolph Hitler are among the characters that come to life in this novel.If you like international intrigue, stories about spies and world domination, I think you will enjoy this book.",1
"Love Game of Thrones, and Book Five doesn't let you down! Such a breath of fresh air after wading through Book Four.",1
"Master and Commander is a very good book, no question.  But it is here -- the second book of the Aubrey/Maturin series -- that the epic adventures really catch hold of a fair wind -- one that runs for another 18 books.Jack Aubrey is fresh off his sucess in the Med.  The Peace of Amiens has grounded him for a while, but he is loving life -- spending his time in a country estate splurging the promised money for the prizes he took in the war.  But the peace is not to last and very soon he and Maturin will be swept up in a resumed war against the tyrant Napoleon, but this time with just as much to worry about on land as at sea.Post Captain is an entertaining adventure in its own right.  Jack's adventures aboard the Polychrest make for riveting adventure.  But what is great about this book is how it broadens the story and sprawls out.  Almost everything that follows in the series is set up here.  The world is fleshed out in much more detail -- the petty politics in the Admiralty; Jack and Stephen's romantic entanglements; the beginnings of Jack's financial difficulties.  Their characters come into sharper focus so that by the end of the novel, the careful reader can almost think with them and know how they will react to their situations.  These two men will become two of your favorite literary characters despite -- perhaps because of -- their all too human foibles.  The only two characters I can think of that work so well together are Sam and Frodo.For those of you who -- like me -- enjoyed the first novel but wondered if something was missing, you will devour this volume.  I tentatively bought the first two volumes.  After this one, I went out and gathered up the entire series in hardback (expensive but worth it).",1
"I read this for a book club I'm in and at first, I enjoyed the chatty style.  Then for a time, I got a little tired of it...In the second half, I just loved the story and could hardly wait for ""what comes next.""  I read it on the Kindle and it seemed like, as a book, it would be very long.  For me, the length was worth it.  Very entertaining.",1
My brother was looking for this book and I ordered it for him.  I was pleased with the price and the fact I could have it shipped directly to him.  Thanks Amazon!,1
"I had heard a lot of positive comments on this book for a while and thought I would see for myself what all the praise was about.  Well this book deserves 5 stars and more.  It is really a book that will stay with you for a while.  I know it will be among my all time favorites, as well it should.  The writer has done an excellent job fleshing out the people and you almost feel as if you know them personally or have dealt with people like time in real life.  The depression was deep in the US when the story is introduced.  Life can hand out a lot of hard knocks, even to animals.  I really never thought about that aspect of life before. I am very happy I had the opportunity to read this book.  I delayed reading it many times because frankly the title put me off.  Then I remembered to never judge a book by it's title.",1
"The only complaint I have about this wonderful book is that it ended too quickly. It was full of intensely interesting characters who had real depth and texture. I felt that I was part of the story, and it was a real pleasure to read this great book. Amazing ending. I loved every page.",1
Thought provoking and chilling. Great settings around the globe and a novel twist regarding serial killers.  You will love it.,1
"I enjoyed this book, the first of Patterson's Alex Cross stories. The book was very exciting and well written about a psychopath who kidnaps and kills people. The story begins with the character who is the crazy guy, Gary Soneji/Murphy who has multiple severe personality disorders along with being a complete nut-case due to his terrible childhood. Gary Soneji/Murphy plays a school teacher at a day-school for rich kids when his intent is really to kidnap and kill the Dunne/Goldberg children. And finally, one day he lured the children into his van and kidnaps them, drugging one and eventually killing the other child. This kidnapping has the whole DC area up in arms, and Alex Cross works day and night to capture Soneji/Murphy, but he doesn't do that until he kills a few more people in different places. His whole game throughout the book is that he ""Wants to be Somebody."" He is the master of killing, and he enjoys the game.Alex Cross trys to help all he can, and he gets inside Soneji/Murphy's head and gets him to tell him all of his horrible little secrets after Soneji gets captured the first time and put into prison. Later though, Soneji escapes from prison and causes more problems. More than just Soneji/Murphy though, is an accomplice. Alex fell in love with a female detective on his team, not realizing that she is actually the one behind more of these problems with the kidnappings and knows the answers to what happened with the children.Cross puts the puzzle all together, and the book is very fast moving and keeps you guessing what will happen next!",1
"It's been a while since I've read a novel that most will classify as literary, though it does have some sci-fi/ paranormal elements, so reading Dust was like gentle spring rain to my reader's mind. Cleansing even. Slade has a winner here, and I wouldn't be surprised if this novel continues to find a broader fan base and further attention.It's got some elements that remind me of Steven King. Not for style of writing or Carrie-like gore. No, the similarities are more subtle than that. Slade has a unique ability to craft something new and not already written in a thousand different ways, like early King works. The creativity in this novel proves that. And choosing a child to tell the story through- genius! The story is that much better for it I'm sure.This took me a little longer to read than normal, but only because I forced myself to slow down, to savor the unique story, the interesting point of view, the perfect turn-of-phrases. I even highlighted a few of them in my Kindle app and usually I'm too lazy for that. So, great book... I certainly recommend it to just about any one.",1
"George R. R. Martin&#8217;s A Dance with Dragons manages to do what its less exciting twin, A Feast for Crows, couldn&#8217;t -- reignite my love for the A Song of Ice and Fire series.Events are more exciting than those of A Feast of Crows, and Martin drops more than a few page-turning cliffhangers throughout the book as he builds the grand narrative back up to another climactic peak. But, it&#8217;s a ponderous build-up at times, with disappointingly empty chapters and side-plots and supporting characters that seem to veer nowhere.The book has a better pedigree than its predecessor. It&#8217;s filled with Martin&#8217;s best and most beloved characters in Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow, Arya Stark, and Daenerys Targaryen. Martin throws into that mix some familiar faces like Theon &#8220;Reek&#8221; Greyjoy, who&#8217;s misery may top all of Westeros, which is saying much. And, one of my favorites, Davos Seaworth, appears early only to disappear for the remainder of the book in a puzzling absence.For most of these favorites, things happen. Jon Snow deals with the hard (and sharp!) realities of being a leader of the Night&#8217;s Watch. Arya earns her mysterious stripes. Tyrion travels vast distances and sees many thing. But, Daenerys &#8212; ah, Daenerys is the trouble. Really, it&#8217;s her book and her transformation. But, like Cersei Lannister&#8217;s chapters in A Feast for Crows, her chapters plod on, one after another of off-stage events as she struggles to be queen. Her transformation is glorious, but getting there is a slog.Then there are the new bloods &#8212; perspective characters like Quentyn Martell, Victarion Greyjoy, and Jon Connington. Martin seems to be playing with these new voices and events. His success wavers. Quentyn Martell feels superfluous, even irrelevant. Victarion more so, though he seems to have something major in store for Daenerys.Given the death and destruction Martin inflicts on his characters, especially to the Stark family, there must be room for new voices like these. But, several thousand pages in, is Martin&#8217;s exploring a vast, wondrously dangerous playground or weaving one of the grandest fantasy narratives ever written? That question keeps me interested, but a little disappointed when these detours end abruptly. They drive home, painfully, his themes about ruthlessness and ambition, of fickle fates and violence, but test our trust that there is anything here worth rooting for, worth investing in.Still, with A Dance with Dragons, there is a sense that Martin is that good -- that all my fellow readers and I suffering for our favorite characters will see some pay off, some day, and we&#8217;ll earn a grand and satisfying ending.",1
I if I had to wait six years for this book to come out I probably would have hated it too. I have read all these books together in the past month or so and this was the first book that I actually skimmed through a few chapters. I know Feast for Crows got really mixed reviews but I still highly enjoyed it anyway. But this book actually has a chapter that we've already read from Crows in here but it's Jon's point of view not Sam's. I thought that was a real waste of space. And I don't care for Vitarion and I thought there was useless time spent on the Dornish men here. I've read that Crows and Dragons was originally one book but GRRM broke it up into two planing that Dragons would come out within the year of Crows and it never happened that way because GRRM decided to rewrite Dragons. My feeling is he probably shouldn't have done that. Oh well. There is usually a dud in every batch. Hopefully the next book does not take any where near as long to come out. I still can't wait to read it.,1
"It took me a couple of chapters to get into this book.  Having borrowed the book at the recommendation of a friend, I had no preconceptions.  I started reading and wondered if it was a dreary book about life in a nursing facility. When my friend asked about returning the book, I ordered an audio version so that I would not have to admit I could not get interested in the story.  I can almost always get through an audio book on my commutes to work.  The book quickly became an engrossing story.  I was cheering for the animals!  The mal treatment some of them received was very hard listening.  The one criticism I had, was Jacob's naivete.  Could he not figure out he was putting his friend's, and his own life, in danger?  I would have found him more attractive had he been more discerning.  As it was, I would not have been surprised had Marlena really not been attracted to him.  Also, I wondered if a talented circus performer such as Marlena was, would not have had to start very young instead of at the age of 17 when she left home and married August.  The ending?  for the circus it was terrific!!  But for Jacob at 93... found it less than realistic!",1
I have read this book more than two times.  It is still a very good story.  I will start the conclusion in a few minutes.,1
i loved this book it brought tears to my eyes. growing up you visit the circus but very rarely do you consider the pains that it took to get to that happy place. the love story mingled in with the tales of the circus it is a shocking ending that most wont see coming.,1
"Dust was a great look at the life of a child who is on the cusp of manhood when strange things start happening in his life. Set in Canada in the dust bowl of the 1930s, Robert is visited by tragedy and then his whole life seems to be turned around when a stranger comes to town and asks all of the adults to join in a too-good-to-be-true venture. Robert seems to be the only one who sees the stranger as dangerous, but no one is listening to the 11-year-old, and is it really worth the effort?",1
"It's been years since I first read ""Quartered Safe Out Here"" by the creator of Harry Paget Flashman, VC. (And I won't rehash everything the previous reviewers have written.) Having read and reread all of the Flashman novels before picking it up, and being a card carrying Flashmaniac myself, I was very anxious to know more about GMF. This book certainly didn't disappoint me. After I had finished it, though, I wanted to find out more. I didn't realize I'd have to wait until December 2002 to finally read the next chapter in the life of GMF in ""The Light's On At Signpost"" (which I found at amazon.com.uk for 20.13GBP). The two books are quite different, except for Fraser's Anti-PC rants, the one tells the story of a young GMF serving in WWII and the other an older, but still funny, GMF telling tales of his years writing movie scripts in Hollywood and the famous and not-so-famous people he worked with during those years. At the end of ""The Light's On At Signpost,""  he briefly writes more about his family, his schooling in Scotland, and how he became a writer. GMF is almost 78 now (He was born on April 2, 1925.)  and I only hope he will live long and write more wonderfully funny books.",1
i loved it.  could not put t down. i defy you to ead two chapters and not HAVE to finish.,1
"I have eagerly awaited this book since I finished the first four Of A Song of Ice and Fire in 2008.  The first three books of the series had superior plot AND characterization.  Each aspect didn't suffer or be neglected for the sake of the other one.  Then came the 4th installment, ""A Feast for Crows"".  Compared to other works of the Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre, AFFC would rank above most. It falls short compared to GRRM's other works.  It seemed that back story brought everything to a halt in this series.  I hoped that A Dance With Dragons would speed things up a bit.  I will give a qualified yes for plot advancement for this installment.****************************Spoiler Alert!**********************************************************Some of the problems of AFFC and this latest installment can be traced to the ending ofA Storm of Swords (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 3).  Two of the main characters Jon Snow and Daenyreus both had spectacular victories.  Jon Snow being named Lord Commander of The Wall and Princess Dany winning Meereen.  The problem being they were both stuck in a literary conundrum.  I was thinking at the end of that book, ""So how will GRRM get Jon away from the Wall and  get Dany to Westoros?  In AFFC, despite good character back story and attention being given to the Iron Islands, the loose ends were still there.In ADWD some plot was advanced; but there more loose ends were created.  Dany did leave Meereen.  Jon Snow may have left The Wall and the story; like Ned and Robb.:-(  I say may because there have been some characters in this saga that have more lives than the luckiest cat.**************************END SPOILER ALERT*********************************************************Some plot loose ends have been tied up in a ADWD for Jon and Dany.  Many more loose ends, though, have been created in the overall story.I welcomed the addition of Ser Barristan Selmy in the story.  There was detail provided to the Eastern Lands and The North.  It provided more background and travelogue for GRRM's fantasy world.  I don't mind this at all.  Sometimes I thought Anthony Bourdain hijacked the novel with food descriptions.I questioned some other character additions; like Quentyn Martell.  Why?  When all was said and done with this character, I had wondered, why was he put in this story?  Whether you love, hate or are indifferent to GRRM's characters they've all contributed to the development of this epic in one way or another.  The character of Quentyn Martell did not meet any of these criteria.There was another intriguing addition that brings to mind the historical Perkin Warbeck.  I'm on the fence with this one.  I'm not sure if it's a useless red herring or something that will add believable complications; thereby adding interest to the story.Overall, this book is a good read for background.  BTW, this is not a stand alone novel.  If you have never read the ASOIAF series and want to read it, please, start with A Game of Thrones.",1
"This small book, originally written in 1984, was and is still revealing.Firstly, on a personal level, Hawking admitted already at that time that &quot;As far as theoretical physics are concerned, I'm already ... quite far over the hill'.Secondly, it gives an excellent explanation of Hawking's contribution to theoretical physics (black holes and their similarities to the beginning of time).Thirdly, Hawking has outspoken opinions about the anthropic principle (against), the universe of Eastern mysticism (an illusion), the many universes theory (not meaningful) or determinism ('Even if we do achieve a complete unified theory, we shall not be able to make detailed predictions in any but the simplest situations').This booklet offers also excellent examples for the theories of relativity and quantum mechanics and contains Hawking's Inaugural Lecture 'Is the End in Sight for Theoretical Physics?'Although this book is, from a theoretical point of view, out of date (no superstrings), it should not be missed.",1
"This is really a heart warming story. I especially loved the elderly Jacob. Working in Long Term Care, I so could see some of my patients over the years in Jacob and perhaps even caught a glimpse of how patients over the years have seen me! The ending warmed the cockles of my heart and left me smiling for days (well all day b/c I just finished it last night, but I can't see not smiling everytime I think about it). Definitely give this book  a chance. I waited when it was recommended to me b/c the Circus didn't really appeal to me, but it really was interesting to read about Circus life in the Depression Era. Loved the surprise twist when the epilogue picks back up at the end of the book! Didn's see that coming, but I guess that's the point. LOVED THIS BOOK!",1
Loved the way it was written.  Loved the storyline.  Great ending.  Very good insight into the time of the Depression and the inner workings of a circus.,1
"I wanted to find out what happened to the characters from the beginning, not try and figure out more new characters.  This has dragged on way too long and is a big disappointment at best.",1
If I could I would like to praise this book in the only way how; by saying that it reads like a book written by a real person not a war hero.  Fraser's observations about the Japanese willingness to fight also need to be taken into account.Overall-You will read it in one sitting that is how engaging it is.,1
"My issue with this book is that it's been years since the last one was released.  And since this book is actually picking up from where Book 3 left off, it's been even longer since that one.  A synopsis of what had happened in the previous books would have been helpful.  As it was, since I didn't re-read the other ones prior to this one, I couldn't even remember who some of the characters were or what had happened to them.  Too many names.  I shouldn't have to resort to Wikipedia or Google to try and remember who someone is.  I also would have appreciated an alphabetical index of characters at the back instead of the way he formatted it.  I can't even count the number of times I flipped to those lists of names at the back and would search it hoping to see the name I was trying to identify.All that being said, I found the book a little slow at times.  But the detail and the imagery is astounding.  The world he has created is vast and I was constantly amazed at how he puts so much into his words.",1
"I read this book at 19 and discovered the delightful character of Ariadne Oliver, the witty, self deprecating and charming self portrait of Christie herself. Indeed, I was so taken with Ariadne that I continued to read Christie in search of her. But while this story includes much of what is best of Christie, a very readable, engaging mystery with young love, a certain tragic nobleness, and of course some whimsy and humor, it is a little too tragic and even somewhat laboriously worked out in the end. A good Christie mystery, but not one of her top ten",1
"Today, just to prove a point, I read the opening of Game of Thrones. There is no denying - through the series, GRRM's writing has become careless and unwieldy. Hi  He resorts to having characters repeat the same stale catch phrase again and again and again.Dany: ""I am only a young girl who knows little in the ways of war""Tyrion: ""Where do whores go""Barristan Selmy: ""I am too old for this""Theon: ""Reek Reek rhymes with leek/meek/weak.....""And so on..Like the storyline, the prose stalled and lumbered. Yet, that wasn't the biggest sin. What of our favourite characters? (SPOILERS).Tyrion - the cunning influencer, the unsung hero of Blackwater, has just a couple of talents remaining - making ""big people"" laugh and being an obedient good little dwarf. He takes to the role of the slave as if he's prepared all his life for it. Serving at feasts, riding a pig, wiping his big master's bottom -  wouldn't any regular lordling learn all that growing up a possible heir to the richest family in Westeros?Dany - OK, she wanted to rule. But she doesn't. Some days she can't be bothered to hold court. She wants to float in her tub under the persimmon tree, and lounge around her terrace watching the ""pyramids of Meereen"". And choose outfits to greet Daario in - she's only a young girl who knows nothing in the way of war! She doesn't execute a single person, despite her own people falling like flies, and that's the same girl who nailed a hundred slave masters to crosses as a payback for slave children murdered in the same way, who sacked Astapor after cheating its masters out of the Unsullied, the girl had crossed deserts and conquered cities on her way to win back the Westeros throne. About that...It's all about peace now, man.Bran - becoming a tree? Really? The boy has crossed into the North Lands to get his legs back, and the best he can get is the offer of even less mobility.Arya - morphing into a chick from Kill Bill. Not that it is a bad storyline on its own, but having spent two books trying to find her family - anyone - this leaves me a bit bewildered that she makes no attempt to get news about any of them. She knows that Jon and Sansa are alive, and seems to have made a choice to forget about them. She enters this book as the Faceless Men wanna be, and exits as the Faceless Men wanna-be. How far she's come!Jon - knifed. OK, most theories seem to agree that he won't die, but you have to wonder why GRRM created such a noble, proud house populated by people you want to know more and more about, only to wipe out most of them so early in the series, maim and rain misery on the rest for the remainder of it.Jamie - appears only to tell us he is galloping off to join Brienne...not without telling us - again - that Cersei has done Lancel and Osney and possibly Moonboy..As a tradeoff, GRRM unleashes a plethora of inconsequential, background characters, some of whom are quite disgusting, to make matters worse. Victarion comes to mind, brutish, cruel, stupid man. His casual cruelty and abuse towards his ""dusky woman"" was quite painful to read about. Why oh why do we need to know about him?Look, it is still a good read. It is still an amazing universe of characters, cities and events, still epic in its depth. I will still be buying the next book, if it ever comes out. But GRRM needs to cull and spare us the scum of Westeros. I've come too far now to stop reading - if I look back, I am lost!",1
"This book like it predecessor received widely mixed reviews. There isn't the kind of grand conclusions to story lines that take place in the previous books, which is disappointing to many readers. This book, like &#34;A Feast for Crows&#34; occurs during a brief lull in the action, and is generally setting things up for (we all hope) a following series of books where all hell will break loose.If you were disappointed by all of the B-List characters in the previous book (e.g. no Jon, Bran, etc.) then you will be pleased to see that their stories all continue in this book.I found the book enjoyable and it makes me very eager to see what happens next. Unfortunately, I am afraid that the next book won't be appearing for some time....",1
"This is a fantastic book and I would definitely recommend it to everyone.  Quick read, but also very insightful. It really makes you think.",1
"Robin Hobb has managed to achieve the impossible with her Liveship Traders trilogy. In a genre that so often uses the same themes and ideas, Ms Hobb has produced an original work.The Liveships of the title are very expensive and rare ships built from the mysterious wizardwood only found in the Rain River Wilds. After 3 generations of the owner's family have died on board, the wizardwood 'quickens' and the ships become living, sentient beings.Throughout the book, the author interweaves the story of the Liveship traders, the story of the sea serpents who are driven by an instinct to search for their 'beginnings' and the tale of Kennick, a ruthless man determined to be King of the Pirates.Ms Hobbs shows an extraordinary talent for characterisation. There are no totally black or white characters in her stories but realistic characters who have their good sides and their faults in abundance. At times the reader will feel antipathy toward the heroine and at others empathy for the 'bad guy'.This is a book that you will find difficult to put down. Highly recommended",1
"This is a very good novel, in the same league as ""Queen of Angels"" of Greg Bear. I think that this one is one of the best hard SF novels of the first half of the 90`s. Certainly is much better than ""Moving Mars"" by Greg Bear (December 15, 1994). I say this even though I really like ""Moving Mars"".The pace of the novel is very good, the characters are well drawn, the level of research is astounding. YOu can actually follow the action on a Mars map (and will need to in order to understand most of the novel). In that aspect it feels like reading Tolkiens ""Lord of the Rings"", you have to had a good knowledge of the land because it gets to be another character in the story. Look for a good map of mars on the internet, there are plenty of good ones from NASA",1
"I loved this book. Definitely a good love story based on trust and understanding of ones past. Have yet to watch the movie, and don't think I ever will.",1
"In my opinion, people who didn't enjoy this book simply aren't a fan of Martin. It seems the biggest problem is the creation of alternate story lines and focusing most of the book on what happens away from Kings Landing. That is actually what I enjoy most about Martin's books. He creates an entire world with so many intricate pieces and doesn't focus on one single small area.I have absolutely no problems with this book as a setup, and it was necessary to the overall plot of the series. I enjoyed most of the additional characters introduced in this book and Martin created some good cliffhangers for the Winds of Winter. After A Game of Thrones, this may be my favorite of the series.",1
I've read most all of Mr. Clancy's novels and John Clark is probably my favorite character in all of his books. This novel explains Clark's whole existence in a very real and believable way so any reader that picks up a Jack Ryan or Rainbow Six Novel will be well informed not only about Mr. Clark but several other main characters in a lot of other novels as well without having to scratch there heads trying to figure out where these particular people come from. Plus it's a great standalone novel all by itself.,1
"This book flashed between Jacob as an old man and Jacob as a young man just after his parents' death.  Despite his being utterly destroyed by his parents' death, he never really mentioned it again after he joined the circus.  That seemed odd to me.  And the roughness with which he was greeted when he joined would make most ivy league softies run for the hills, so that was odd, too.  I could never understand how he was finding comfort from his parents' death by being treated like crap and working like a dog with barely any water to drink or shower.I enjoyed the elderly Jacob much more, and was charmed by the ending.  I did not enjoy the lengthy descriptions of rolling up circus tents and beating of animals.  I know it happened, but it made me feel ill.  And the sexual descriptions?  I don't like them.  I'm not a prude and I certainly enjoy sex and all its wonders, but I'm sick of reading about it in every single book I touch.  Just once, can't we just leave the details of that out and let a tale stand on its own?I guess the ending made the book worthwhile, but I wouldn't recommend it as much as others have recommended it to me.",1
I got hooked on these books from the start and finally had to order the whole set. I finished this last book and can't wait for the next book. The price was right and the book came in in a very short time. Good quality and will order again.,1
"I very much enjoyed this book, it is not one of my favorites, but I am very happy I read it. I recommend it for people who enjoy Ernest Hemingway as a writer, but if you are new to him, I would do a little bit of research on this book before deciding to read it.",1
"Great reading as per the series. Good to get back to Danerys, etc. I'm just anxious for the series' COMPLETION!!",1
"I loved Master and Commander but I thought that this book was even better.  O'brian wisely realized that although the workings of man-of-war during this period are interesting and sea battles are exciting, it is not enough to base a whole novel on, much less a series of novels.  So O'brian spends  more time developing his characters here than he did in Master and  Commander and the result is a more interesting novel that the reader  quickly becomes completely engrossed in.  I think that Jack is a much more  likable character in this book and Stephen is much more interesting and  even more comically eccentric.  There is a fair amount of romance in this  book, but it is handled so well and the book is just so well-written in  general that I didn't mind it at all.  There are two battle scenes in the  second half of this book that will make your heart pound (they are  extremely well-written).  By the way, the scene with the bear costume is  kind of stupid, but it is just one small miss-step in an otherwise  fantastic novel.  In sum, this is a wonderfully entertaining novel, full of  interesting characters, humor and great action scenes.  I will be reading  H.M.S. Suprise very soon!",1
The characters were interesting and the circus storyline kept my attention throughout.  Learned some facts pertaining to a big top circus.,1
Thought of my Dad more than once while reading this.  Highly recommend this read on a summer evening.  Thank you,1
"I love this book.  Not as good as ""A Storm of Swords"" (wide and away seen as the best in the series so far) or even potentially ""A Clash of Kings"", but still an awesome book. The book has some high points but feels more like a set-up book than the first three books. Definitely an improvement over ""A Feast for Crows"" (also a set-up book, but this book does it MUCH better). Basically, the 4th and 5th books are set-up for the 6th and 7th books, but A Dance with Dragons does the set-up in a great way.I can completely understand why fans are divided over this book but still I think this book is awesome and would recommend it to anyone!",1
"Wow, these plots a n d subplots are so real and plausible it is hard to remember it is fiction.  It is fiction, right?",1
"Glancing at the ratings for his 5 books in the series, one would think these are just ""good"" books. They are masterpieces. 1-3 & 5 were slam-dunk 5 star books. They were every bit as good as the Asimov Foundation and Robot Series, better than Frank Herbert's Dune masterpieces; in fact some of the best sci-fi/fantasy I have ever read. Note I did not mention Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. As it was my intro into science fiction (after Andre Norton's great Daybreak: 2250) it will hold a special place and no flaw, other than the running after Saruman's orcs for chapters, will be heard by me. I also left volume 4 for last. I am probably the wrong person to ask. Basically, most of the characters in that book were ones I did not like much (""the villains"", more or less). Since my favorite characters had little roles I  rated it was a 4. Book #5 started BOOM and was a 5 star all the way through.because it returned to the complete story, slowly advanced the story significantly, explained moves by each of the players of GOT, brought back a couple players thought removed and left us hanging with the mother of all cliffhangers. Get it, get it quick, keep it safe.....shu",1
"this book is one I couldn't drop, number five is a book about rustling up some feathers for more to begin to the next book. loved it! can't wait for 6!",1
"I have read lot of Christie , and I found this book to be slower than most. It as also les interesting, in that I guessed the ending, which I usually don't do.  As Christie books go, I wold call this one second shelf.",1
"Written as if he were talking to you, this book is full of gems of insight.  If you are on a spiritual path, this book is an essential. Anthony DeMello makes the case for awareness as the basis for spiritual awakening.  This book should appeal to both Buddhists and Christians.",1
"WATER FOR ELEPHANTS by Sara GruenThis is a marvelous book that covers the two bookends of the long adventurous life of Jacob Jankowski, going back and forth from him as a ninety-plus-year old in an assisted living facility, to him thinking back to his days working on the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth, a circus that moved around the country in its own train.He is all alone in the nursing home, with most the employees viewing him as more trouble than he is worth, except for one wonderful nurse named Rosemary, who shows him respect and compassion, and is for all practical purposes his only friend at this point in his life. While he has many family members, his children are now old themselves and the family in general has moved on without him. They take turns visiting him, but he gets the feeling their hearts are not into it.Mr. Jankowski maintains his sanity by thinking back to his days as a young man in his prime. The story into the past begins with him finishing up veterinary school at Cornel. His plan is to join his father's practice, but, just before he finishes his final exam, he gets the news that his parents have been killed in a car wreck. To add to the tragedy, he finds out that his parents were bankrupt and losing their family house and everything they own, a result of the bad economy and them putting all their money into Jacob's education at Cornel. He responds by joining the Benzini Brothers Greatest Show on Earth.His journey down memory lane provides us a rich assortment of protagonists and antagonists, and a loving, touching account of the animals that were under his care as the official veterinarian of the circus. He falls in love with the star of the circus, but she is married to a brute, having been sold off to him while she was still a child. Jacob has constant run ins with her lover, as the man is in charge of training the animals for the circus acts. The man is a barbarian, often mistreating the animals, his wife, the workers, and he and Jacob rumble several times.The owner of the circus is a two-bit conman that often physically abuses his workers, and more often than not--it seems--fails to pay them. This of course leads to great friction with the working men, some of whom disappear during some of the train rides, thrown off the moving train under the orders of the mad man in charge of the circus.Along the way, the circus picks up a prized elephant, named Rosie, who does not respond to any commands and is judged to be a worthless animal with an alarming appetite. The trainer responds by beating the elephant on several occasions. Jacob intervenes and figures out the elephant responds to Polish, which provides the circus new life, with Rosie emerging as the star of the circus, along with Jacob's love, Marlena.There are several wonderful side stories that outline the struggles of the wonderful array of characters that make up the circus crew. They travel around in the Depression, attempting to survive when most circuses are folding their tents and going out of business.I loved the ninety-plus-year old Jacob and especially his flashbacks to earlier days that showed the wonders, dangers, opportunities, underhandedness, splendors and tragedies of life on the train circus. The story tells how difficult it is to age, to become old, to be viewed as no longer capable of living a normal life. It also is a story that tells us to follow our dreams when we are young and do all we can to make them come true.Ms. Gruen provides a fitting ending to the book. I will not spoil it for you, but you are certain to like and appreciate it.This is a wonderful book that I highly recommend.Hey Joe (Jamaica Series)",1
"This book was recommended to me by a friend. I went out, bought it and finally read it. It was amazing book. The book kept me hooked to the last sentence.  It was well writtin and you get to feel sorry for the old man but he finds peace in the end.  This book does not disappoint.  It is a time peace but you will still love it.",1
"In a former life I was a public librarian. On the morning of 9/ll I was walking back into the library after helping the local Red Cross arrange to ship units of blood to New York. A retired Air-Force officer was walking out carrying Tom Clancy's EXECUTIVE ORDERS. He looked at me and said ""We told them how to do it.""Recently a favorite author tweetered about a study conducted to pin point identifing characteristics of Musiem terrorists. I read the study and gagged. Mr. Clancy did a much more outstanding job in 1996 with EXECUTIVE ORDERS.Read it and match it against today's newspapers and media reports.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS.",1
"The book hits you like a slap to the face.  Right from page 1.  Some of the ordeals Alexander Dolgun goes through are mind boggling.Beyond the story of a man who endures everything, I also enjoyed the narrative on the internal problems of the Soviet communist system.  Whereas most of my knowledge of the USSR is based on the American Media, this book put a face and a heart around cold war russians.The book began to drag near then end, but overall an amazing book.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in Survival, simple torture, and Cold-War Russia.",1
"An early series by Kay who was still learning his trade.  Had some poor transitions from one development to the next, but the action was fast paced and kept your interest.  It many respects it is a rehash of several mythologies including Norse/Celtic deities and the Arthurian legend, but it is cleverly done.  Having read many of his later works you can see that he was still developing his style as a writer.  Worth a read if you are fond of the author or the subject matter",1
"This book will not change your life.  You will know everything that is going to happen.  I learned a bit about early circus life.  I learned a bit about how Depression impacted families and choices.  The best part was the view from the patient on life in a nursing home.  Other than that, it was entirely pure pleasure.I don't even know exactly why I like this book so much- it was such an easy read, it almost felt like a Danielle Steele novel, but there was more to it- it truly felt like drinking a warm cup of cocoa on a cold night.I read the negative reviews because I couldn't figure out how someone could not like this book.If you are looking for a life altering literary experience this isn't it.  If you are looking for a nice summer read that is a bit more substantial than chick lit, this is a good choice.  We read it in our book group and to be honest, there wasn't a lot to discuss, despite the controversial topic of circuses and nursing homes.  It was more of a love fest of how nicely the book was written.I recommend it.",1
This is one of the best sheldon books ever.love hate murder and mystery.this will keep you up late.recommend to all of your friends.pageturner,1
"I hate buying a series that takes years to complete. This may or may not be the last book, as in reading the intro by the author he was alluding to another book to come.So far, it is a little confusing since the last book I reread was number 4, this is number 5, and I do ot remember all the characters and 5 is supposed to be going on at the same time number 4 was.I want to know how it ends so I will continue to read it but if you have not started yet, wait till HBO finishes the mini-series then you can buy the books.",1
Would of liked to see some of the characters from previous books but still it was a good read.Looking forward to the next book.,1
"What absolutely delicious reading this is! Master and Commander was excellent. This is even better. I cannot believe how very, very funny O'Brian can be!There is a little scene in the beginning of this book  where he briefly describes Jack's horse, a ""sullen gray gelding"" who spends  most of his time ""mourning his lost stones"", and the horse's train of  thought, something like, ""Sits too far forward at a jump, I'll have him off  sooner or later... Oh, a mare! A mare!""  I just laughed myself to tears.It  is rare to find a book that has such a rich blend of various ingredients.  O'Brian's insights into the wide variety of human personality (not to  mention equine!), his quirky sense of humor, his excellent portrayal of the  ways of life in that time, the politics, the navies, the ships, all are  tied together, and blend beautifully into this absorbing human drama.I  think I'll have to read them all!",1
"so my new rescue dog, chewed up about 15 cookbooks while I was at work. This one is a favorite and I do use it quite a bit. Although the chewed up book was useable I wanted a new one, so this is the replacement. This book has beautiful pictures and a good history of Thailand. It includes recipes for the curry paste and other condiments as well.",1
Loved reading all 5 in the series. The story is exciting and humorous. I can't wait to get home each night and start reading.,1
"""H.M.S. Ulysses"" was famed author Alistair Maclean's very first novel, a raw, emotional, and thinly-disguised account of a British warship on the Murmansk Convoys of World War II.  The convoys carried war material to the Soviet port of Murmansk in the high Arctic under the guns of Nazi planes and ship operating out of occupied Norway.  Between the frigid weather and the Nazis, convoy losses were extremely high.The warship of the title suffers the disgrace of a mutiny aboard ship after too many days and nights on the convoys.  The British Admiralty, short on escorts, sends the ship and crew straight out again on a voyage of redemption.Maclean's service in the Royal Navy during World War II included time on the Murmansk convoys; he populates the crew of H.M.S. Ulysses with the kind of battle-weary men he served with, and their portraits ring true.  These were men with no illusions about themselves or their chances for survival, and no loyalties save to the ship and their shipmates.  Among the most memorable is Captain Vallery, the Commander, a duty-driven, almost saintly man, slowly dying of tuberculois but unwilling to abandon his crew.  His sacrifice is only one of many portrayed by Maclean; an ordinary seaman's refusal to leave his post under fire, even to save his own life, is made believable and memorable.H.M.S. Ulysses and its crew will strive to the very end; few readers will be unmoved by the penultimate scene of the book.  This book is highly recommended to fans of Alistair Maclean and to others looking for a first-rate reading experience.",1
"Derek Robinson's novel, A Good Clean Fight, follows the remaining characters from his earlier Piece of Cake to the North African Desert in May 1942.  As in previous Robinson novels, much of the focus is upon the fictional ""Hornet Squadron,"" now led by ""Fanny"" Barton and equipped with P-40 ""Tomahawks.""  The pilot ""Pip"" Patterson, the squadron adjutant ""Uncle"" Kellaway and the intelligence officer ""Skull"" Skelton are also on hand.  However unlike other Robinson novels that focus mainly on life within the squadron, A Good Clean Fight has substantial roles for the Germans and for a British ground unit.  Captain Jack Lampard is a British Special Air Service (SAS) officer who leads daring behind-the-lines raids on German airfields and Major Paul Schramm is a German intelligence officer tasked with finding and defeating the SAS raiders.  There are also a number of other SAS and German supporting characters that add depth to Lampard's and Schramm's roles.  A Good Clean Fight also has considerably more combat action than any other Robinson novels and the book crackles along at a very good pace.  Indeed, the novel starts off very well and could have been a truly great war novel if Robinson had not allowed himself to get distracted with several unnecessary sub-plots in the middle of his work.  Nevertheless, A Good Clean Fight is very good and probably one of Robinson's finest efforts to date.The main plot with ""Hornet Squadron"" in A Good Clean Fight focuses on efforts to entice the Luftwaffe fighters to come up and fight in the quiet period that preceded the Gazala Campaign.  Barton, afraid that his hard-luck unit might be broken up, offers to conduct a systematic ground attack program in order to get the German fighters to commit to action (the Germans preferred to hold their fighters back in order to prepare for the main battle coming).  In effect, Barton commits his unit to an attritional campaign that can have but one end for the squadron - whittling down pilots and aircraft in the hope that something will ""break loose"" before the unit is combat ineffective.  Barton has changed somewhat since A Piece of Cake and is no longer very sympathetic; many readers might feel that he is sacrificing his unit for his own sake, but that is unfair.  ""Fanny's"" efforts to ""outfox"" the enemy as he says, and ""Skull's"" pointed explanations of why this is unlikely are quite interesting.  In the midst of this growing tension in the unit, Robinson delivers several excellent and exciting descriptions of air-ground attacks on assorted targets.Lampard begins the novel with an exciting raid on a German airfield and even briefly captures the intelligence officer, Schramm.  Robinson's depiction of these raids gives great insight not only into SAS tactics of the period, but the type of men who excelled in this type of work.  Lampard in many respects is the SAS leader par excellence - aggressive, physically impressive, cunning and ultra-competent.  Unfortunately, Lampard has some flaws which may not be uncommon in the special operations community: he is a ""risk junkie"" who doesn't know when to quit and he lies to superiors and subordinates in order to cover up his mistakes.  Like Barton's attrition tactics, Lampard's ""risk tactics"" seem preordained to eventual catastrophe, of course, with much bravery along the way.Schramm starts out as a very interesting, witty character but gradually withers into a sour, introverted, pathetic sort.  While Schramm and his peers do provide some tension in the novel with their ""cat and mouse"" game with Lampard, one feels that the SAS are never seriously threatened by Luftwaffe intelligence.  Indeed, the one German effort to send a large patrol out into the desert to ambush the in-coming SAS patrols ends up in total and ridiculous disaster.  The worst parts of the novel involve Schraam's involvement with an Italian female doctor - this goes nowhere and means nothing.  On the Allied side, the antics of two reporters is also quite distracting and useless.  Were it not for these distracting minor characters - who somehow elbow out the main characters in midstream - A Good Clean Fight would have been nearly perfect.As usual, Robinson's humor is very dry and very dark, and is certainly the most compelling aspect of his novels. Robinson is able to show both the bravery and the stupidity in war, as well as just the sheer misery of trying to fight in blast-furnace heat, covered with flies.  In a historical sense, Robinson also delivers insight into neglected facets of the desert war, such as the ""Takoradi"" trail the Allies used to ferry planes across Africa and the German air raid on Chad to interdict the trail.",1
"This unique story brings back a slice of the 1930s, the long gone circus world of the past, but not the usual bigtop action.  The main character is without giving away anything serves in a position that straddles the worlds of performer and worker and yet belongs to neither. There's madness, grinding poverty, tradgedy, revengeexcitement, bewilderment, surprises, and revelations, but I don't believe a review should be a book report, so trust me if you like suspense, tinged with the meaning of life itself, please do yourself the favor of reading this wonderful novel.  I wish I could erase my memories and do so afresh.  Jim.",1
"You will be glad you read this book before the movie, even if the movie is true to it in detail.  Few movies do their masterpiece books justice, and this book is a masterpiece.",1
"This is my second time reading this story, and it still holds up well. The first time I read it I was blown away by the brutality of the story and frankly embarrassed to say I enjoyed the story. The second time through it didn't appall me as much, but then again I knew what I was getting into. This is typical Donaldson; he explores the darkness of the human soul and can put human despair down on paper better than any author out there, and it's in full display here.Anyway, this is the first book in his sci-fi GAP series that sets the stage and introduces the triangle of characters, Angus Thermopyle: the ore pirate, Morn Hyland: the police officer, and the ore pirate Nick Succorso. The story is interesting in that it starts with the end of the story, but then fades back to the start and tells the ""real story"" of what happened. It's hard to say anything without giving it away, but it focuses on Angus and Morn and how he comes to capture her and break her, but as shown in the first few pages we know that Nick somehow gets involved too in his lust for Morn. To tell you the truth there's not much to the story beyond that and the fact that these three characters get developed through the story.This book isn't a happy one, it's dark, sexual, and violent, and it will put off some readers. You could almost say this is sci-fi horror, but the horror is human and not supernatural. I think this it is an interesting tale, told well, and introduces us to a new world built by Donaldson. Personally I love this story, and enjoyed it the second time around.Of note, it's a short read, as it's not a very large novel.",1
"And fiction it is, based upon historical characters and NOT historical fiction.  The main character, Elyne, is (according to the author's notes at the end) a composite of two characters, one of them being Ellen, the daughter of Llewellyn the Great and Joanna.  I admit to being a bit put off at the first part of the book at the characterizations of some of the Welsh court, particularly Joanna.  Having read SKP'sHere Be Dragons, and having adored Joanna and Llewlleyn and their great love, I admit to grumbling abit at having Joanna being portrayed as such a sanctimonious biddy. Then I realized this was strictly a piece of fiction and I kicked back and thoroughly enjoyed the story.  Lots of truly evil villains, two timing false tongued kings, some wonderful heros and a spooky ghost or two.  What more can you ask for in a book?Apparently some of the reviewers were put off by the size of the book.  It went very quickly for me, but then I'm the type that doesn't like to read any book under 500 pages if I can help it.  As a side note, Erskin's books are not readily available in the US, except by special order and thus paying freight.  I was in Vancouver, BC recently and found two of her books on the shelf at a major bookstore in downtown Vancouver on Robson street.  If you're in Canada it's worth checking out.",1
"It's a thin book which has deep thoughts about topics like love, generosity, death, prayer, etc. It can be read again and again because it is thin while at the sametime it contains so many words of wisdon.",1
If you're reading this review then you should have already read the first four books in the series.  I won't give anything away but there are a lot of unexpected plot twists complete with the death of some great characters and some not so great characters.I love all the song of ice and fire series and this is no exception.  If you've read the other books then pick this one up and continue in the amazing world that could only come from the mind of George R. R. Martin.,1
"I've noticed that some have said they wanted to like this book due to the high praise others here have given it. I will try not to gush. But honestly, this is one of THE best books I have EVER read.From the beginning to the magnificent and most satisfying end, I was entirely delighted. Not every page was perfection I will admit but my annoyance was due to my own impatience about wanting to get back to a certain character rather than learning a bit more about another.It is quite clear from the moment you begin that the author did some seriously extensive research about the Depression era in general and circus life specifically.The way the author weaves the story between present day and older Jacob (at 90 or 93, he can't quite remember) and the flashbacks to the past (when Jacob was in his 20's) are fantastic. She handles aging and its inherent frustrations quite well, and Jacob is funny, endearing, and intensely likable.I enjoyed this novel so much, I immediately took it to my parent's and insisted they read it. Usually they stick to Nelson DeMille and Janet Evanovich novels (whom I also enjoy) so I knew this would be a little outside their comfort zone, but they humored me and read it. They both loved it! My father was as impressed as I at the ending, the satisfaction of it.They both commented that some of the nursing home scenes were depressing; Jacob discussing his failing memory or lack of motor skills. But I say again, the ending completely makes up for anything depressing in the home, at least for my family!Truly an amazing novel and I daresay, should be on the list of best books for the 21st century.  I read this book straight through, without stopping to sleep.Just an FYI, I actually HATE circuses. I find them tedious and beyond boring. NOT my sort of thing at all. Ugh. This book transcends all that.",1
"Ordered the book after watching the tv mini series and found the book much better than the series. A greatly overlooked period of North American history &#34;Gold Diggers&#34; answered a lot of questions. And sent me on a search for other books on the same topic,Suddenly my library has gone from zero Yukon gold rush books to 5, all covering different but also overlapping topics of the gold rush.Very happy with it!",1
"I have just finished this after reading books 1-4.  Seems I can't stop reading these books, so addictive.  I am also waiting eagerly for TV to catch up.",1
"So far I haven't really found one book any better than the others, it's basically just one fantastic series.This is the first series where I didn't know from the beginning what was going to happen.",1
"I spent most of this book wondering why Gruen chose to intersperse her primary story of a young man who found himself thrust into the circus life in 1931 with the musings of that same man at the age of 93.  The story of how Jacob came to be in the circus and what happened to him there seemed like enough to me, and Jacob's aged voice seemed unnecessary.  At the end of the book, though, I realized why she gave us both perspectives, and could hardly argue with her narrative device, as the closure it provides works so well.",1
"Despite haunting cover art and a great title, despite obvious research and well thought out prose, and despite the fact that this book is the darling of the Independent Booksellers Association, I felt let down.  Part of the problem was that I expected a lot and had held this book on my shelf, until I could really savor it.  It does start out strong, and Gruen keeps her time periods well separated.  But the characters, especially the narrator, feel stock and unfinished and merely devices on which to hang the proceeds of research.  Because of the plusses of the book enumerated in the opening sentence of my review, I give 3 stars, but for the back story, it would be fewer.",1
"It wasn't too long ago that it could be said that ""the sun never sets on the British Empire.""  Much of the credit for this truism goes to The English East India Company--a huge commercial enterprise that grew from a small group of Elizabethan tradesmen into the ""grandest society of merchants in all history."" The expansion and colonization that made England great was for the most part due to the efforts of that Honourable Company.It is to John Keay's credit that he is able to tell the story of the early beginnings and subsequent growth of the this group of merchants and administrators in such a lively and anecdotal manner while keeping strictly to historical accuracy.Whether you are a writer of historical fiction or an avid history buff, this is a great addition to your library.",1
"Kay certainly creates his own world in Fionavar; and he has the writing skills to back it up.  I was a bit reticent to buy this book as it starts out in modern times and there was world travel, but as a fantasy enthusiast I was glad that I gave this book a read.  It has been some time since I read it, but I remember book 1 and 3, being the better ones.The trilogy has a dream-like quality, as the author creates a past for the characters that emerges in a somewhat unique fashion.  The climaxes throughout the books are really hit and miss.  One of best written battles I've ever read was in book 3, yet in book 2 I felt an entire adventure that spans half the book was a complete waste of my time.The rules for magic appear arbitrary from a systematic viewpoint.",1
"Maybe it was me, but it was just ok for me.  There was not a lot of action.  it was a sweet love story that took place in the setting of a circus.i like the ending",1
"Enjoyed the unique look at circus life in that time.  Also, the author had a very good understanding of, not only the process of aging, but how a person experiencing it thinks and feels!  The ending was surprising and pleasant, but not really realistic.",1
"This is the ultimate hard-science fiction novel, surpassing even its Golden Age models.  No aliens, no paranormal, no tricks to get around the speed of light, no cheap fight scenes.  Robinson takes an idea -- colonizing Mars -- and examines it from every possible angle: geology, technology, politics, economics, religion, you name it.  He also examines it from multiple human points of view by having each ""chapter"" (some of them novella-size) dominated by a different character: a Machiavelian schemer (Chalmers), an egotistical politican (Maya), a hard-headed engineer (Nadia), an adventurous explorer (Boone), etc.Of course all this takes up a lot of space, and that obviously puts off some readers.  It's a matter of taste.My main beef is the treatment of the two ""religion"" characters Phyllis Boyle and Hiroko Ai.  Boyle seems to be a dumping ground for whatever Robinson dislikes most at the moment: first she's ecumenical, then she's a fundamentalist, then she's a hypocrite.  In the space-elevator planning meeting Boone complains that ""she was acting as if she was in church"", whatever that means. Fanatical?  Entranced?  Hypocritical?  Bored? People do a lot of things in church. Robinson needs to make his point of view clearer in places like this, instead of assuming that the readers share all his opinions.Meanwhile we're supposed to take Hiroko seriously as the founder of a new religion, but to me it sounds like so much hocus pocus.  Using Latin and Greek doesn't make one profound: ""Viriditas"" just means ""Greenness"" and ""Areophany"" means ""Revelation of Mars""; so what?Likewise the distribution of moral responsibility.  The metanationals (and, of course, Boyle) get blamed for dumping too many immigrants on Mars, yet the inventors of the longevity treatment, which ALSO creates overpopulation on Mars, don't get blamed at all.  Why?  I don't know; ask Robinson.  But there's enough fascinating material in the book to compensate for this.",1
"Similar to the other books in the series....a good read, but can be slow at times. GRRM goes into detail on the meals served, so don't read on an empty stomach.",1
"Clancy cleared the bar (that he set himself) easily with this one.  He has written/co-written/consulted on some dogs, but I've always been a fan.  The attention and commitment to detail are superb, as are his sources (obviously).  I've read and re-read most of his books more than twice, and all of them to date at least once.  This is where John Kelly (Clark) hits the scene,  and his story is world class REAL and emotional, even for ""Mission: Impossible"" fiction.  There's nothing in Clancy's books that ""couldn't happen"" even when not at his best.  You can read the back cover for the storyline, but I promise that once you open the front cover you won't stop until you've read everything in between. Cussler, Ted Bell, W.E.B Griffin, Dan Brown...I read them too, but Tom Clancy at worst is a great read.  And his best is THE best, and this is one of them.",1

"This is an excellent, well writen book that takes the reader to a world that is seldom encoutered by the average person. It is a well researched account of the USA circus of 1929, including the good and bad. It was a glamarous facade hiding unimagined cruelty to animals and people.",1

"I loved this book - there are a few naysayers in the sea of positive reviews and there is a reason for this.  It is an excellent book - of course it is not air tight but it is a fun read and interesting.  It reminded me in some way of the White City book in that it took history, in this case of the circus in a certain time period in history, and wove a story around this history.  It took me a little less then two days to read it and well worth the story!ooking for a fun fast read with a great story line - buy and enjoy this book!",1

"No one can do characterizations like Dame Christie, and she can even do these remarkably well within the confines of a short story.  This little book of Miss Marple short stories is a wonderful cap to the entire Miss Marple series.  I had read some of them individually, but there were some I had not read before, and I enjoyed them all.  My own particular favourite though was ""The Case of the Perfect Maid"" (an oxymoron if there ever was one).  It is remarkable how Ms. Christie can typecast each of her wonderful characters so quickly, and provide us with tricky and intricate mysteries at the same time.",1

"Khalil Gibran's The Prophet is a truly awe inspiring work of prosaic poetry.  Despite being a native-born Arabic speaker, Gibran wrote The Prophet in English, ensuring that his powerful words lost nothing in translation.The work's 28 short chapters recount the words of a prophet as he leaves his home to depart on a new journey.  The words that flow from the prophet's mouth and onto the pages are philosophical and spiritual treatises on all aspects of life.  Chapters discuss the range of human experiences and include discussions such as ""On Friendship"", ""On Pain"" and ""On Death.""  What unites the 28 chapters is Gibran's thought provoking and probing literary style as Gibran's prophet invokes his listeners to live life to the fullest.  The book is not overtly religious but every word and sentence is filled with a spiritual clarity.The book is eminently quotable with every chapter providing a nugget of truth worthy of repeating.  Amazingly, Gibran packs his masterpiece into less than 100 pages, making it a very quick and easy read.  Readers will find themselves returning to The Prophet again and again to recapture the beauty of Gibran's words.The Prophet, which Gibran himself recognized as his greatest masterpiece, is a timeless literary classic.  Its truth has touched generations of readers and will undoubtedly continue to do so.",1
Not everyone loves this book but I did!  It was my first novel read on my new Kindle Paper White!,1
"Sara Gruen has penned a most enjoyable book about life in the circus.  The story unfolds in two time frames from the first-person point of view of Jacob Jankowski.  As a twenty-three year old vet traveling with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth and as a ninety-three year old man confined to an assisted living facility and repulsed by the sight of his aging body, his ever-sharp mind moves us effortlessly between the two time periods.  We are told he is about to reveal a secret he has kept hidden for seventy years----and what a story it is!In 1931, a tragic accident takes his parents from him and leaves him alone and penniless in the midst of the Great Depression.  The circus is both his salvation and his personal hell as he signs on to care for the animals.  Jacob and the characters he encounters are drawn so vividly that you will remember them long after the last page is read:  Marlena, the pink-sequined star of the equestrian act; her mercurial husband August who suffers with bouts of paranoid schizophrenia; Walter, the dwarf whose mother sold him to the circus, and Camel, the first member of the circus to befriend Jacob will all make you laugh and cry and cry again.  But it is Rosie, the lemonade-stealing elephant, who will steal a piece of your heart and cause you never to look at elephants in quite the same way again.Heartbreaking, poignant, and with a double surprise of an ending, this amazing plot unfolds with actual circus stories the author tells us in her end note that she has taken from real life.  Peppered with antique photos of long-ago circuses, this is an amazing book not only of circus life but of a man coming to grips with his diminished capacity and the aging flesh surrounding his ever-young heart.  A true joy for this reader, and one I highly recommend.",1

"Sometimes, when one has high expectations of an author, one can be dissapointed with the final work.  Not so with Robin Hobb's Ship of Magic.  This is the fourth of Hobb's books that I have read and I am becoming more and more of a fan with each one.While the Ship of Magic begins very slowly, the action and intrigue pick up quickly about half way through the book and don't let up an inch the rest of the way.  The characters and storyline are wonderfully compelling and full of emotion.  Believable interactions between characters and the way that Hobb gives a glimpse of their true thoughts gives the story a very realistic feel.  Human misery, hate, joy, and love are described in a way that a reader can almost feel, really bringing the story to life.I strongly reccommend all of Robin Hobb's books.",1
Great book.  Was listed as used but appeared brand new.  Would consider buying from this seller again.,1
"I very much enjoyed reading this book - it was well researched and really interesting.  My rating reflects my disappointment that the book seemed to simply stop before any resolution of the plot was reached.  The author added a post-log which indicated she liked to leave her readers imagining what happened to the main characters after the book ended.  And in most situations, I can live with this.  However, the end of this novel left a question quite literally of life and death hanging ... and I felt seriously unsatisfied.  Looking online, can't find that there is a sequel.  So, if you enjoy a good story but are OK with wondering after the ending whether the characters lived or died ... have at it.!  I would like to have had a more satisfying ending.",1
"Really interesting read if you like early England and the courts of the kings and queens. Well written and gave insight into how it could have felt to be a girl born during that time and in their particular cast. Written from the perspective of the Anne's sister and gave one a picture of the King, Henry the VIII and just how ruthless he really was. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FC2MDG/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_img",1
"""You just keep on being sweetly stupid, Mary. You do it beautifully.""Mary Boleyn is one of Queen Katherine's many ladies-in-waiting. But things change when she catches King Henry VIII's eye. Her family, led by Uncle Thomas Howard, quickly push her into becoming the King's mistress, but Anne, Mary's sister, is never satisfied. Set amidst the turmoil of King Henry's early rule, we follow Mary through her affair with the King, the strife between King Henry and Queen Katherine, and the marriage of King Henry to Queen Anne.The best way I can describe this book is ""guilty pleasure"". There is so much to dislike about the book, and yet I was entertained for the entire part. Not to mention, this book made me research Tudor England and the whole drama with King Henry VIII and his many wives, and any book that makes me interested in looking up history or researching the backstory gets a bit of a boost in my book.PLEASE NOTE: I am no historian, nor am I particularly well-versed in this era. Therefore, I am not going to get into much detail about whether or not this book is historically accurate. There are other reviews that go into FAR better detail about whether this is accurate to history; I will defer to them. But I do caution: if you are expecting 100% accuracy, I would encourage you to pass this book up. Just the itsy bitsy bit of research I have done doesn't seem to quite match up to what PG presents here.With that out of the way, let's get on to the good stuff!First off, I really didn't like our ""protagonist"", Mary Boleyn. In Gregory's story, Mary Boleyn, the sometimes ""other Boleyn girl"" (though the term was applied occasionally to Anne), is the younger sister of Anne (this is one of those areas where historians will tell you that most likely, Mary was the eldest--and in this book, I really felt that Mary acted more like the eldest than the youngest). She is married to William Carrey and quickly attracts the eye of the King. Her family then tells her to seduce him and bed him, which she does. But after the birth of her second child, Anne whisks the King's attention, and Mary is left in the background.I'll admit, I like it when characters aren't perfect, aren't the best or smartest in a field, aren't able to make the right decision each and every time, have actual flaws. But Mary really tries the patience. According to history, Mary was the beauty but not so bright (it was Anne who was the brains), but Mary in TOBG seems unable to put the simplest conclusions together.For instance, when William Stafford leaves to secure a farm for a ""court lady"" he's been interested in, Mary IMMEDIATELY assumes he has been seeing someone BESIDES her and snubs him. OF COURSE, we know that William, who knows Mary's desire to be a simple farmer's wife, was actually purchasing the farm for HER. (In Gregory's defense, this Misunderstanding did not last very long.)Another count against Mary is her passivity. I know women in this period do not have the freedoms that modern women do, but Mary was a complete doormat. She rarely even tried to defy her family. Most of her actions are either A) forced upon her or B) reactions to other people's actions. She doesn't initially WANT to seduce the King, but her family forces her. She balks at helping Anne, but her family tells her to. She wants to see her kids, but her family won't let her; therefore, she doesn't see her kids.What is almost worse is when Mary complains about how she can't do anything, how if she had her own free will, she wouldn't have done X. She could have put up a little more defense, tried a little harder, pushed a little more. Or she could have just been kicked out of her family. But personally, I like Queen Katherine's response to Mary's BS best:""If you had not been tempted, you would not have fallen. If it was not in your interest to betray me, then you would have been loyal. Go away, Lady Carrey. You are no better than your sister, who pursues her own ends like a weasel and never glances to one side or the other.""And that leads to my other complaint. Mary likes to think she is way better than her sister, Anne...but most of what Anne does, Mary has done before. Or she gloats (and I mean GLOATS) about what she didn't do. Such as:+ When Anne was sent to Hever, Mary writes Anne every week and gushes about her pregnancy and how the King lurves her so much.+ Enjoying how Anne has to wait on her, then being p!ssy when the tables are turned.+ Being upset when Anne gets married to the King, but legitimizes her affair with the King (in fact, I never felt that Mary was at all guilty for sleeping with the married King or committing adultery against her own husband).+ Being upset when Anne is pregnant with the King's baby, but when she was pregnant, she rubbed her sister's nose in it.And then we have how she has an affair and can't BELIEVE how her husband William Carey is upset at her (uh, duh?) or her claim to be loyal to the Queen even though she is sleeping with the King. For the latter, she even names the child she bore through Henry after Queen Katherine! (How tacky!)But it seems that Mary is supposed to be the perfect, sweet sister. She is loyal to the Queen, even turning against her sister. At one point, Mary becomes a confidant of sorts to the Queen, and the two giggle about how awful Anne is--sure, that's believable! We also know Mary is ""good"" because she wants to abandon court life for country life after a mere 3 month stay at Hever! And then, when she becomes a farmer's wife, she ADORES making cheese and cooking and has NO PROBLEMS with all the work she suddenly has to do. And while Anne meets a terrible end, Mary gets a happily ever after--her children, a loving husband, a little farm, and all the things she ever wanted.Instead of being the perfect, sweet, innocent, beleaguered sister, Mary came across as a dense, two-faced, passive hypocrite, unable to do anything for herself, who somehow got everything she wanted but didn't deserve.But as much as I despised Mary, I adored Anne and Queen Katherine. Sure, Anne is personified as a bawdy devil, a woman desperate for power and the Queen's throne instead of an intelligent, highly religious woman who really did love the King, but I felt that a lot of what she did was understandable. She was smart and cunning; when her family didn't support her (and for a good portion of the book, it seemed they did EVERYTHING to make her life miserable), she made her own way using her own wits and skill. Mary needed guiding throughout her entire time of her affair; Anne was more than capable of handling herself. Her struggles to give birth to a son were heart-rending; her desperation understandable (not that I really believe she slept with her brother or was a witch). As for Queen Katherine, she was a respectable woman, a good wife. I felt bad for how King Henry put her away in favor of Anne.As for the rest of the characters, they are pretty one-dimensional. King Henry is ALMOST ALWAYS called a ""boy"" by Mary, which was irritating and disturbing. King Henry, I always got the impression, was a pretty strong, charismatic guy. I'm sure he had some childlike aspects, but I felt nearly every other time Mary saw him, she was comparing him to a child. If Mary found him so childlike, how could she have a years-long affair? Ew! Jane Parker is so snoopy and awful; Jane Seymour is so virtuous and sickeningly pure; Uncle Thomas was pure evil; George honestly felt campy gay (I'm surprised more people didn't find out about his orientation); William Stafford is so ""wonderful"" and ""manly"", I wanted to be sick. None of them really stood out; none of them felt like people whom I could interact with and meet on a daily basis.A key component of this story, the whole reason I believe it was written, was to show the competition between the two sisters, to compare and contrast. But while The Cranes Dance did an EXCELLENT job of showing two sisters who love each other but feel threatened by each other as well, this book flopped. I felt like both girls hated each other viscerally, until one of them would do something unexpectedly nice to the other or say how fond they were of their sister (and mean it).Another thing that I felt really hurt the story was one key historical component. I know I said I wouldn't nitpick history, but I felt this component REALLY affected the story. There is NO WAY Mary's son would have ever been considered an heir apparent to the King, even if he were to marry her after the fact. The King already had an illegitimate son through Bessie Blount; he would have been the first in line if illegitimate children were in line for the throne. So all of the family's crazy talk and effort to get Mary married to King Henry and how their illegitimate son would be heir is silly and ultimately pointless. Sure, if the King married Mary, she MIGHT have another son, but that is the only way for an heir to come.After Mary's affair with the King, the story really stops being about her and is instead about Anne. I guess it makes sense, but when the story tries to return to being about Mary, it is boring and so drowned in sugary, sweet sappiness, I thought I was going to go into a coma. Mary and William are a boring couple. They meet, they fall in love, life goes perfectly for them (with a few mild speedbumps that are IN NO WAY Mary's fault). William is not at all frustrated with Mary for being unable to do simple household tasks; Mary loves being a housewife and getting her hands rough and dirty. William is A-OK with Mary's earlier affair; Mary has no problem giving up court life to live in the country. Oh, and they have AMAZING MIND-BLOWING SEX. The relationship COULD have been interesting; these two characters come from wildly different worlds. But because Mary has to have everything turn out perfect for her, there was no drama.I must commend PG (or her editors, future books will tell which of those is true) on the brisk pace. Very rarely does the book just sit around and do nothing; for the most part, the story moves and is pretty engaging. I might not have liked some of the characters, but I WAS interested in seeing how they would turn out. And I listened to this book to the very end with little regret for the time I put into it (and I've regretted many a book I've sat listening to through to the end).One more thing: Susan Lyons, you are an amazing narrator! Pat yourself on the back!I do not recommend this book for history buffs or hard-core Tudor enthusiasts, but for those that don't mind some mindless, deliciously catty entertainment, this is a decent read. At the very least, it will make you head to the library or the ebook store or to Wiki to do some research of the time; at the best, you will have spent a few hours (depending on whether you are reading or listening, of course) immersed in a time left behind long ago. I certainly don't regret the time I spent listening to it or the new knowledge I have of the Tudors.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*",1
"I've spent many months over the years on the &#34;Banana Pancake&#34; trail, hauling a backpack through Asia and elsewhere, solo or with friends, seeking the next thrill, brooding over the meaning of it all, and watching the world mutate around me.  A lot of people who have done the same have speculated on how to process this experience into something like a novel, and Evans does an admirable job turning the world backpack adventure into a decent murder mystery.  While I can't say I enjoyed his writing style, and found the dialogue at times pretty painful to read, the overall experience was good, and the plot kept me guessing until the end.",1
I really enjoyed this book. It was a departure from other books I've been reading and I enjoyed it so much. It was interesting to read how circuses were run behind the scenes and how people got involved in them. The story was very compelling and I loved the ending!,1
Can this guy write a &#34;bad&#34; book?  I don't think so.  What an adventure!  Keep on disfiguring your heros.  I love it.,1
"ADWD was merely OK.  In my opinion, this book lacked focus.  There was plenty of ICE and very little fire and a lot of smoke.  There are nuggets in this volume that had me thinking Okay now we move forward...but alas more smoke.  The first half of this atrociously long book mirrored the last book...oh Martin actually explains that in ""A Cavil on Chronology"" about the dual nature of this tome.  Geography is the culprit...not haphazard plotting.That said, I still could not say that this book is awful...it provided some interesting meat to several questions about certain characters and total disassembles several others. Martin, destabilizes Dany.  She moves from strength (walked through fire) to meekness (the walls will protect Meereen).  He totally punks Jon Snow.  He moves from capable (Commander of the Wall) to discounting his own advice to himself repeatedly.  I did like how Martin delved into ""Reeks"" character--from a brash young hothead to a meek shell of a Ramsey fan boy who had occasional thoughts that would have required backbone.  The rest was, in my opinion, smoke and cliffhangers.  Cliffhangers only serve if we get to see who goes over the cliff in short order.  If WOW is as long and bloated as ADWD with page after page of...this is what we ate, and this is how the sea looked, or with more insipid phrases like ""where do whores go?"" or ""you know nothing, Jon.."" or ""words are wind"" I will not scream but skim most judiciously.I'm still interested enough to read the next installation (a copy from the library will do);  if it doesn't take 5 years to be published. Even three years in modern times is way too long for any author to complete a work in a series.In short...don't recommend this book to NASCAR fans...it's way to slooooooooooow and has no rhythm and is short on the music of great story telling--character or action driven plot.",1
"Water for Elephants is a very fine book, well worth the read, for many reasons:1.  The book wonderfully captures place and time.  Set in the depression, it authentically  captures the spirit and feel of the era, including its description of the economics of the time, hobo life, the depression, etc.2.  It vibrantly and realistically describes life in the travelling circuses of the era, including the freaks and other performers, the pecking order between management, performers and workers, life on the train, stops for shows in the small communities, and vivid descriptions of the performances.3.  The characters have depth and breadth, and touch you with their humanity (which is sometimes kind and more often than not, evil--as humans can be).4.  The novel very effectively contrasts the protagonist's current situation in a nursing home with his recollections of the bulk of the novel's depression-era actions.5.  Without giving too much away, the novel very satisfyingly (if perhaps a bit unrealistically) concludes with a feel good ending--and who can resist a happy ending.In conclusion, this book is a decently written, plot driven, page turner, which tells a touching tale, set against a colorful background of time and place, populated by characters which are larger than life (yet realistic in thought and deed).  While the writing perhaps does not qualify it as ""great literature,"" its easily the best of the ten or so books I have read over the past six months.Ken",1
"""The Winds of War"" is a bona fide 5 STAR book if there ever was one!  It is the Gold Standard of historical fiction of World War II.Some folks decided to trash the book based on an apparently highly flawed Kindle version or some badly mangled used books.  These were not literary criticisms and the people probably should have sought an alternative method to register their valid complaints.  Diluting the considered comments and thoughtful ratings of (people judging) the substance of the book is not fair to the author or to prospective readers.This book takes the reader on a sweeping historical journey from events leading up America's involvement in the war.  Our protagonist, US Naval Captain Victor ""Pug"" Henry, has a large adult extended family which is spread out across the globe and this allows Wouk to deal with pre-war Nazi Germany, the blitzkrieg of Poland, the Battle of Britain, Italy, Stalin in Russia and finally Pearl Harbor.The characters and storyline are so good it leaves you aching for more.  And he delivers ""more"" with the sequel, ""War and Remembrance"".For wonderful thought-provoking entertainment and a history lesson all rolled into one, these 2 books are the best you can get!John E. NevolaAuthor of The Last Jump - A Novel of World War II",1
"I have read 21 fiction books in the last month, all written by New York Times best selling Authors. ""Without Remorse"", is one of the best books right up there with ""Red October"" and ""Medusa's Child.""The only negative, at least for me, is there are several places where the book goes the background of things that do not advance the story forward, so in those few cases I just speed read for two or three pages.Author of al-Qaeda Strikes Again",1
I admit I bought this book after reading the great reviews and because Robert Pattinson is currently filming this movie and I really enjoyed the story. So much I am reading again. I am so looking forward to the movie when it comes out next year. I recommend this book.,1
"Robert Jordan, an American in at least the third generation, and a teacher of Spanish from Montana, goes to fight in the Spanish Civil War. His motives are never discussed, as are not the theater of or the reasons for the war. The novel is rather about several people who, in the course of a few days, are helping Robert Jordan complete his mission: to blow up a bridge.The novel's tall order - being ""involved in Mankinde"" to the extent of fighting thy neighbor's civil wars - is echoed in the story's close engagement with each character. Here is the natural-born killer Pablo, his no-nonsense and wise Gypsy wife Pilar, the beautiful young girl Maria who is carrying much pain, the good old rock of a man Anselmo, who fights to win this war, but who in his bones knows that thou shalt not kill.Robert Jordan is singled out to have both the first and last name. All the other foreigners go by their last names and the Spaniards - by their first ones. Besides embodying the foreign engagement in the Spanish affair, Robert Jordan also brings a distinctly human element into the war zone: the lonely human name among the nomes de guerre of general Golzs and partisan Anselmos.The book is written as if translated from Spanish. The language is a bit choppy, many expressions read like Spanish idioms translated verbatim, some phrases are left in Spanish. This adds to the feeling that one is in a foreign setting. As it often happens in Hemingway's novels, much working of the human spirit is revealed through this simple language.",1
"Never have I been as frustrated with a book, which I suppose is a testament to its quality. If it sucked, I couldn't care less what happened next, right? As it is, Ship of Magic has some of the most engaging characters I've read in a long time, and really quickly draws the reader into the lives and motivations of both the protagonists and antagonists, and there is a full cast of each.Even the bad guys are very well drawn with individual motivations and backstories.The frustrating part is that Ms. Hobb doesn't resolve any of the major plotlines in this book, and I haven't read the next installment yet! Worse, even more questions and issues are raised at the very end. I'm dying to read what's next for these living breathing people (and ships.) It ends at such a crossroads for so many of the characters than it's as if watching a half dozen of your closest friends in the world on the brink of a life changing decision.",1
Sure it is a well researched book.  The detail and description of circus life is very realistic and at times downright disgusting.  But what else does this book have that made one of my friends rave that this was the best book she had every read.  I'll tell you what....nothing.  I partly read this book on the recommendation of friend but I also wanted to read it because it was described as a murder mystery book.  A mystery murder it is not and by the end of this book I wanted all of the main characters to go away too!  I won't spill any beans but frankly this book deserved less time on the best seller's list and more time on the bottom of my discard pile (the books I will never read again or books that I would like to forget).  You make up your mind.,1
"This book is one of my all-time favorites because I loved the main character and the woman he fell in love with, but most of all, I loved the adventure of the traveling circus. Gruen had to have done a major league amount of research to learn what the circus was like in the 1920s. And my guess would be that she really did meet a man like the main character. Otherwise, how could he be so believable and so lovable?I have lent this book to several people. I know the author prefers to hear that everyone bought their own copy and I get it. But ""Water for Elephants"" is a book everyone should read.",1
"As a person in his 70s who deals with a mother-in-law in her 90s, I found much Jacob's trials in the nursing home close to home. That he could escape into the memory of his youthful connection with the circus was probably a life saver for him.Ms Gruen did a masterful job of separating and at the same time blending Jacob's experiences in his youth with those in his present state of being 90 or 93.It is worth reading this book all the way through to get to a surprising and wonderful end that I shall not reveal so as not to spoil it for others.Ms Gruen obviously researched circuses. Her attention to detail, both when she wrote about the circus and also when she wrote about the nursing home helped make the story realistic.All in all, it was well written and held my attention.",1
"This book never ages, it is sincerely ageless...",1
"I have read this book three times over the past three years. The story is not only compelling, it is a very real look at what life 'B' circuses was really like. I had a great-uncle who worked in 'B' circus troops who told his stories of life in such  traveling troupes to my father who re-told those stories to me. I could not find one flaw is this re-count of circus life in the 1930s.",1
"I absolutely love Sidney Sheldon. His books are always richly drawn, with strong characters, and intriguing plots. And this is no exception. I fell in love with this book when I was 16 (I'm now 32) and have read it over and over again. It's that good.Tracy is a seemingly ordinary woman working an ordinary bank job and about to marry a somewhat ordinary man. But her comfortable life is turned upside down when her mother commits suicide after being financially ruined by a smooth talking New Orleans Mafia man. Tracy embarks on a half cocked plan to get revenge and ends up taking the fall in an insurance swindle and sentenced to an exorbitant amount of time in a Lousiana prison. Tracy will walk into prison an innocent woman and come out an ingenious cat burglar headed for a life she never even imagined. But first she must deal with the men who conspired to murder her mother and send her to prison...This is a fantastically fun story. Sweeping from the grounds of the Lousiana penitentiary to the luxury of the Orient Express, it takes the reader on a world wide trip of a lifetime, as Tracy becomes the world's most wanted cat burglar. Along the way she meets several colorful characters. Imagining herself a modern day Robin Hood, she is careful to only swindle those who would swindle themselves. The reader will find herself surprised to be rooting on the bad guys, enjoying a vicarious thrill or two, and smiling at the crazy plots Tracy manages to pull off.This book is a quick, easy beach read and one that will stay with you long after you turn the final page. It's the kind of book you can put on your bookshelf and come back to years later, eager to live and relive Tracy's exciting adventures. Sidney Sheldon is an incomparable author and this book is no exception.",1
"I know I should only do one star or five star reviews because those are the one that get read, but this book is really right between. So much so that I don't even know if I will read the next in the series or not. Science of Mars ecology and stuff like space elevator is interesting and pretty solid, which science on stuff like immortality treatments is just plain silly and puts everything else in doubt. Economics and psychology are really, really stupid. Characters are pretty dull individually but as a group, keep you reading. No real protagonists here.",1
"It is not my practice to post reviews when my Kindle says I have read only 48% of the book in question.  I am making an exception hoping that things are going to improve.  Right now I am not hoping, I am praying...to the old gods, to R'hllor, anyone...that GRRM has become a factory operation, like Thomas Kinkade Painter of Light, and that he has a horde of apprentices racketing away at their keyboards, occasionally pausing so that He Himself can insert telling phrases like, ""Words are wind,"" to lend authenticity to the product. At this stage of the ""narrative"" (I know, a jape), we have Tyrion penned up on ""The Stinky Steward"" with Penny (I used to know an irritating one I dubbed ""Small Change,"" and I pass that along) and a sow named Pretty Pig.  Now that's harsh even for crossbowing your evil father in the gut. I think.  And it's not as though we haven't witnessed Tyrion's remorse for the deed again, and again, and again...  Right now this isn't A Dance With Dragons, it's a Plod With a Pig.  And achingly unreadable.  Thanked be fortune, it hath ben otherwise:  Asha, dead or alive, got a world-class shag out of young what's-his-name before the northmen arrived; I applaud the chapter which made Melisandre actually pretty sympathetic, which I did not previously believe to be possible-- still can't quite get the interplay of Mance Rayder and Rattleshirt, but hell, details-- and as long as I can quit thinking, ""This is just like American Graffiti,"" with all the feckless adolescents cruising after the semimystical Blonde in the White Convertible, things are going along.  Sort of.  Except for this wish I have that someone (Daario is my candidate) would tie Dany up and tell the Unsullied to let those dragons loose after allowing sufficient time for prediction and handicapping on a city-wide basis.I am going to finish this book somehow.  My prediction is that there's no way all of these stories are going to wrap in only two more volumes.  Keep those apprentices typing and call Pizza Hut.",1
"After reading TIGANA, I decided to read the first book in this acclaimed series. I did manage to read the whole book, which is one good thing, because the really bad books I stop reading as soon as they get boring. In short, the book does keep your attention. I think most of this is due to the book's originality. Sure, the OTHER WORLD apart from OUR WORLD may not be so original--Zelazny's Chronicles of Amber comes to mind--but there are other parts that ARE original. The hunter in the wild fields. The overall storyline about five young ones going to a world they don't understand. The summer tree itself. One thing that I noticed was that Kay used FAR too many commas in this book. Some sentences, sorta look, like this. In the end, this is only a mediocre fantasy novel, especially when compared to the works being cranked out by such heavy-hitters as Robert Jordan, Terry Goodkind, and George R. R. Martin.",1
"Having heard mixed reviews on this book I wasn't sure  what to think, but I found it to be an easy, enjoyable read. I recommend this to anyone looking for an easy before bed book or an accompaniment to your summer travels. Great fun!",1
"While best known for her mysteries featuring her famous sleuths Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple, Agatha Christie wrote many works that did not involve them and often touched on a wide array of topics.  &#34;Destination Unknown&#34; is one of those works that touches upon the fears of Communism during the Cold War.  It is an intriguing thriller that will keep readers curious.The story begins with Jessop, a British security agent, trying to discover why so many of the world's best scientists have been disappearing.  After questioning Olive Betterton, the wife of the most recent missing brilliant mind, Jessop is certain she will lead them to her husband,  But when her plane crashes in Morocco and Olive is on her deathbed, Jessop knows he needs another plan.  Enter Hilary Craven, a young woman who looks similar enough to Olive Betterton to fool anyone not familiar with her and with a sorrowful enough past that leaves her fearless of danger and death.  She agrees to pose as Olive Betterton but soon finds herself in over her head when she and four others are whisked away in the middle of the night to a strange complex in the middle of the desert.  Olive a.k.a. Hilary is about to be reunited with her husband, but will he accept this stranger as his wife or give her away?  Can she find the answers that Jessop and the authorities of other countries have been looking for?  Or will she get swept along with the currents of propaganda that have swayed others, far more brilliant than she?&#34;Destination Unknown&#34; is a fast paced read and a welcome departure from Christie's other mysteries.  The fear of Hilary's pretense being discovered creates enough suspense to keep the story moving.  The incorporation of the fear and lure of communism is an interesting facet that Christie deftly explores.",1
"In the body of PKD's works this is not a masterpiece, but neither is it insignificant.  My review is based on rereading the Ace book edition of 1970, a paperback plagued by misprints.  Mostly these don't matter but I struggle to make any sense of the third paragraph of page 140 - perhaps someone else can resolve it for me.  I was also a bit confused about New Men - sometimes they seemed to be marked by huge heads, but at other times their identity as New Men was obscure as in the case of Thors Provoni, the returning astronaut bringing, well, was it God - our friend from Frolix 8.  But then another character (it had to be Nick) was involved in this dialogue:'God is dead,' Nick said. 'They found his carcass in 2019.  Floating out in space near Alpha.''They found the remains of an organism advanced several thousand times over what we are,' Charley said. 'And it evidently could create habitable worlds and populate them with living organisms, derived from itself.  But that doesn't prove it was God.''I think it was God.'Of course Thors is the name of a god, albeit a Norse one and he is supposed to be bringing salvation for Old Men (and Under Men, the underground resistance) against New Men and Unusuals.  But nothing is simple in the worlds of PKD.  The ending is magical as characters entwine in unexpected interactions, the last few pages seem to go on forever - there is so much potential and I kept wondering how can I be so close to the end of the novel - so much could still happen, and what does happen is so unexpected - like Beethoven introducing a new theme to the last movement of the fifth just before the symphony ends - opening further possibilities.  Of course, just like life, things are rarely resolved and even if one thread of life does resolve, it can only do so in the presence of an infinite variety of other ongoing threads.",1
