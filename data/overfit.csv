"This is the fifth book in a series.  I first saw the video of Game of Thrones and was hooked so I bought the book which really cemented my interest in the Starks and the Lanisters.  I couldn't wait to read the next book which had many surprising twists that led me to the third book which I enjoyed but not as much as the preceding volumes.  I struggled with the fourth book but did finally finish it and I purchased the fifth book which was so slow and dull that I quit reading after 600 pages -- I might ultimately finish it but I'll wait and see.  I became entranced with Ned and Catelyn Stark and their Children Sansa, Robb, Bran, Arya, and Rickon.  Tyrion Lanister was easily the most interesting character I have encountered in a long time.  Cersei and Jaime Lanister were equally fascinating as was Brienne.  But Martin killed off Ned and Catelyn Stark and that was just the beginning.  By the time you get to Dances with Dragons Robb Stark is murdered, Arya has disappeared into some sort of religious order but her status is unresloved. Jon Snow has gone off fighting Zombies of all things and his story just gets duller and duller.  Bran seems to be headed into some sort of weird status as a ""changling"" or a tree -- undetermined.  Rickon Stark just vanishes from the story.  Tyrion's story just drags on and on with no resolution and his ultimate fate is not resolved.  Jaime seems on the cusp of redemption with Brienne but his story is left hanging and whether or not Brienne was killed is left open.  In short all of the characters who made the story interesting are either killed off or left hanging for what surely must be book 6.  To make matters worse books 4 and 5 could easily have been reduced to 300 pages each by simply dropping all of the tedious descriptions of clothes and food.  Plus more and more characters are introduced who lack any of the interest of the original characters.  I found myself skimming through whole pages of descriptions that did nothing for the story.  I started skipping all of Jon Snow's battle with the zombies as being simply too dumb to accept.  At that point I realized I was done and no longer cared about any of the characters.  A great start to a wonderful series but it deteriorates into a very poorly written soap opera about people I don't like and have  no interest  in.  It is a dull and tedious end to what could have been a great story.",0.0
"Not a page turns without a member of the British commando unit making a quip. The humor is so dense that even one of the characters remarks on it! And the military behavior of the British commando unit, specifically the behavior of the unit's leader, Major Smith, is so laughable that it boggles the mind. In one passage Major Smith (played by Richard Burton in the movie) remembers that he tied up a German radio operator in a room just above the room he has set on fire to cause a diversion. Well, even with Alpenkorps soldiers just yards away searching for the British, and the whole fate of the mission in great jeopardy, Major Smith, even to the consternation of Lieutenant Schaffer (played by Clint Eastwood in the movie), runs back up to the room where the tied up German radio operator is and unties him! It would seem that the World War II Alistair MacLean wants to impart to us was a kinder, gentler World War II where chivalry still ruled military conduct; IT DID NOT, ON EITHER SIDE OF THE CONFLICT!Another thing that annoyed me was the disrespectful way in which Lieutenant Schaffer refers to Major Smith, his superior, throughout the novel: 'boss'. However, the character of Lieutenant Schaffer can be excused for such insubordination since MacLean, unintentionally, gives us a character devoid of any intellectual rigor, to put it kindly. Particularly squeamish is Lieutenant Schaffer's imbecilic spur of the moment decision to marry and spend the rest of his life with a British agent he's just met in Germany!The screenplay for the movie, also written by Alistair MacLean, is by contrast a far superior product. MacLean excises from the movie all of the ludicrous quips and the equally ludicrous military blunders committed by the British commandos that are found in the novel.Avoid the novel at all costs! Watch the movie instead!",0.0
"I bought this book based on two 5 star customer reviews, and because at the time, it was 94th in books at amazon.ca. I've purchased many books on nutrition from amazon. This is the only one I sent back.Coming from a Canadian author, I was hoping to like this book, but after reading the small section entitled ""Milk and Calcium"", I lost a lot of respect for this man as a ""nutrition authority"".I think the author could have produced a better book, if he'd written in greater depth, on fewer subjects, the ones he was most knowledgeable on. Dairy foods are not one of these subjects, and his bias in their favor is painfully obvious.He portrays the anti-dairy segment of our society as being primarily animal rights and vegetarian organizations, and claims that independent researchers fall on the side of the dairy industry for milk's health benefits.Don't Drink Your Milk!: New Frightening Medical Facts About the World's Most Overrated Nutrient( While this book is dated, the number of medical doctors recommending against consuming dairy products has continued to grow.)He acknowledges that, ""Milk stands accused of contributing to heart disease, stroke, breast cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, diabetes, allergies, stomach cramps, diarrhea, autism, mucus production, and, get this, bone fractures!"" He fails to acknowledge the theory that's becoming more widely accepted within the nutritional science community for why cow's milk may not be a positive contributing factor for bone health. That the milk proteins can contribute to an acidosis of the blood, pulling calcium from the bones to maintain a stable pH level, and negatively impacting calcium balance in the body. He continues, ""But milk is also linked  with reducing heart disease, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and of course, bone fracture"".""The anti-milk arguments often begin with the observation that no other species except humans drink milk after weaning.""( Again, he neglects to mention the rest of the story. That in Nature, no other species would ever consume the ""breast milk"" of another species, regardless of stage of life.) ""That's hardly a compelling argument. No other species designs airplanes, develops antibiotics, or bakes bread either.""He tries to refute the Nurse's Health Study by suggesting that the nurses who were drinking the most milk, were doing so not because they liked it, but because they knew they had a genetic predisposition and/or other risk factors for osteoporosis, and believed consuming more cow's milk would help them. So, to his way of thinking, drinking more milk was largely a reflection of an overall greater risk for developing osteoporosis in general, and therefore milk should not be singled out and blamed for the increased incidence of hip-fracture seen in the Nurse's Health Study, as the extra milk was possibly beneficial, but just not beneficial enough to overcome the other risks in this ""self-selected subgroup"". While the lead author of this study may lend some support for that hypothesis, her coauthor, Dr. Walter Willett, does not.In this short chapter the author refers to the heavy environmental contamination of dairy as a ""trace of dioxin"". He acknowledges that dairy fat is a problem, but suggests we eat low-fat dairy, and also limit saturated fat in our diets elsewhere.He doesn't get into the tumor-promoting properties of casein, the primary type of milk proteins. Likewise, he stays right away from the whole raw milk issue, or movement, and the destruction of nutrients through pasteurization. There's no discussion on grass-fed, as opposed to grain-fed cows, or any issues relating to factory farming. Although he does give brief mention to insulin-like growth factor.Most people who know anything about nutrition, know that 2% cow's milk actually contains over 30% of calories from fat. The dairy industry likes to mislead, or deceive the public, by measuring ""water"" weight, rather than counting calories.This author pulls a similar stunt with calcium. He boasts, ""A glass of milk contains about 300 milligrams of calcium, a cup of yogurt 400. By comparison, the best vegetable source is broccoli, with about 100 milligrams per cup.""Of course he's not only wrong about broccoli being the best vegetable source of calcium, ( bok choy and kale are both significantly higher ) but he doesn't bother to mention that a cup of broccoli contains only about a third the calories of a cup of milk, and, like other cruciferous vegetables, broccoli has a far superior nutrient-profile. He does recommend broccoli in a different part of the book.There is some comic relief with the author's explanation for why large segments of the world population are lactose intolerant. Apparently, the human species evolved hand in hoof with the dairy cow. But centuries ago, the tsetse fly spread sleeping sickness throughout much of Africa and Asia, decimating cattle populations. So, not having access to cow's milk, human populations, over time, lost much of their ""natural"" ability to make lactase, the enzyme responsible for lactose digestion.While some primitive populations did thrive on diets containing some cow's milk, it's important to make the distinction that what they consumed is a far cry from what is available to us at the grocery store. Derived largely from grain-fed cows, pumped up on growth hormone to increase milk production, and antibiotics to ward off sickness inherent to the animal's living conditions, much of the already compromised nutrition in the milk is destroyed through pasteurization. And dairy fat today, contains more dioxin, and more environmental contaminates in general, than any other food North Americans are likely to consume.The author claims that while ""milk may not be a miracle food, it can contribute significantly to a healthy diet. It assuredly is not poison, as suggested by the likes of PETA"".Webster's Dictionary defines poison as, ""a substance that through it's chemical action can injure or kill"".It's debatable whether cow's milk, as it's generally produced today, is actually poison, but it most assuredly is, as the Weston A. Price Foundation acknowledges, crap!While ""milk and calcium"" is admittedly a very very small portion of this book, in my eyes, the author has seriously undermined his credibility. Do I now trust or care what he says about fluoride added to tap water? No!Who do I trust?If you want to know what the medical literature says about diet and health, read Joel Fuhrman'sEat to Live: The Revolutionary Formula for Fast and Sustained Weight Loss",0.0
"In case you stumble upon this review amidst all of the other droning articles, I'll try to keep mine short.This was my first Hemingway, I finished it just recently, and man is he overrated.  There are moments of greatness within the pages, and as for the simple act of creating a story, placing characters and orchestrating a chain of events, the guy wasn't bad.Unfortunately his pretentious writing style bleeds through on nearly every single page, so absurdly that it disrupts from the actual story.  I loved the characters, I was intrigued by the plot, but halfway through I realized that I was FORCING myself to continue reading because the poor old bastard kept getting so far gone on his cheesy tangents of love, and of the minor backstories of characters found only within the backstories of supporting characters (Pilar's matador's tale that consumed four or five pages) that the story suffered greatly.Hemingway fancied himself a wordsmith I suppose, and therefore managed to crowbar the word ""now"" about fifty times into a single paragraph, often repeating the word up to four times in a row, and the truly funny part is that people regard him as a genius for it.So after experiencing Hemingway I can honestly say that I won't be going back, and I can only envy his success.",0.0

"I couldn't read Tom Clancy's Red October, or any of his other books. They were just too detailed on the different ships the Navy has, bombs, etc. However, Without Remorse is more character driven and less technical. It is a fast paced, good story. I really enjoyed this book.",0.0
"As I write this the Space Shuttle just launched after being delayed for a month with technical glitches - this in 2009. It's still a ""hold your breath"" event whenever that marvel of space technology takes to the sky. After two tragic crashes, no one can take for granted that the shuttle will go and return safely.Why then does the author think that in the year of 2026, a mere 17 years from now, we'll be capable of putting 100 people on space craft and deliver them safely to Mars! This is the first thing that struck me about this story - totally implausible. And that's before we get into the whole idea of making machines from sand, who then in turn can make other machines, who make other machines who then make every conceivable material thing a crew of 100 and then 1000's could possibly want in outer space. Never mind the dense planetary descriptions and technical psycho-babble the author uses to cover-up these wild leaps of faith. Oh, and did I mention they figured out how to stop aging, even turn the hands of time backward! That's right; these people are still screwing each other at 100 years old. Something I don't really want to think about frankly.Finally factor in the most boring characters and virtually no information of what motivates them - well, someone else said it well.

"This book was a philosophical touchstone for insecure Boomers of the mid-1970s. Everybody I knew in those days had to be able to discuss it intelligently or risk being thought to have a gap in our characters as people. A folk/ talking blues singer of that era (I forget who) referred to this book in a lyric:""...a copy of Kahlil Gibran's 'The Prophet' with all the significant passages highlighted--the whole damn BOOK was highlited...""In truth, the whole phenomenon was symptomatic of the societal immaturity of my generation as young adults. It taught us all sorts of theoretical concepts of human nature that were not necessarily reflective of the real world--consideration, the dignity of each person, peace, love, repudiation of prejudice--all of this in a world that anything but reflected such beliefs in Gibran's day. And except for the hippy-dippy pseudo-enlightenment we tried to cram down the world's throat in our day, our peculiar era was no better. We just used Gibran and other such philosophers to peer-pressure one another into self-defeating meekness. If someone you knew was erudite enough to understand philosophy but didn't have the moxie to stand up to people when he should, Gibran was the ideal way to make him a bona fide doormat and make him think he liked it. I won't even try to speculate how ""relevant"" Gibran is nowadays. From the perspective of a sadder but wiser man--or at least not quite as stupid--I give you this Sting lyric from the song ""Consider Me Gone"" for consideration:""To search for perfectionIs all very wellBut to wait for HeavenIs to live here in Hell""",0.0

"I loved Martin's first three books, but I doubt I will read another in this series. He is no Tolkien.  I don't mind a 1,000 page book if it is interesting, has a good plot, and the characters are well-developed.  However, I feel that Martin thought he was being paid by the word!  This particular book is supposed to run parallel to book four.  He admits that book four was running too long and that he split it.  Well, he should have taken one of the swords from the book to it.  It gives you the feeling that he cut all the description or stuff he didn't like in book four and threw it into book 5 as an after thought.  He keeps killing off old characters and creating new ones, as well.  This makes the book seem disjointed.I wound up skimming a great deal and forcing myself to read through to the ending.  Only a few story lines were resolved in the book.  I am really disappointed.",0.0

She repeatedly makes stupid choices, leaving the reader to wonder how ""smart"" she really is.  There are too many irrelevant characters.  The ending is completely unsatisfying, given how long I spent to slog through the book.  The author is not bad in terms of description, but the only real element of ""suspense"" will be figured out by a thinking reader by page 100 or so of the book and is not nearly enough to carry a reader happily through to page 700.

"Right out of the gate let me say that I hated, hated, hated book 4 (AFFC), but respected the author's work enough to give it three stars, plus, the fact that I hated it because of its left turn away from characters I cared about is telling - I still care, I guess. So while I guess I hate this one less because we've turned back again, it gets 2 stars, because honestly, while I still respect GRRM's way with words I am utterly disillusioned with his ability to control them in creating context any longer.Let's just cut to the chase, GRRM didn't ""have to"" create two books out of one, what he ""had to"" do was let his editing staff cut out the trenchers of filler and get back to the meat of a very, very good story.  Alas, words aren't just wind, they're also cold, hard cash.But GRRM expecting us to buy that these two books just ""had"" to be published separately is somewhat of an insult to the intelligence of his readership.",0.0
"Don't get me wrong.  I loved books one, two and three.  LOVED them. After reading book four, I had a strong feeling that Martin was going off the deep end. Chapter after chapter of crap I didn't care about, hundreds of pages of back story download, useless information, useless characters, gobs of side stores and adventures only to finally culminate in disaster for EVERYONE I DID care about.Still I had hope. I thought ... this HAS to get better.So on to book five. The first quarter of the book is a trial. Again, hundreds of pages of back story blather, much of it about characters that were minor in the first books, but suddenly are the central figures in the series ... for no apparent reason.  Theon Greyjoy?  Really?  Why? Suddenly, some old knight that got retired in book one gets page after page of point of view, a new princeling gets his own storyline. Meanwhile, the characters you really want to know about are forgotten, pushed to the wayside, no longer worthy of a page or two when their stories are what made you struggle through all that back story to get to in the first place.STILL, I had hope. So I plowed through the rest of book six, only to be totally and completely furious with what he does in every single storyline. It's almost as if Martin wanted to lose the fantastic readership he had in the beginning. What was he thinking?When you start off a series with a handful of characters the readers love, then KILL EVERY SINGLE ONE, you've got to at some point say, enough is enough.  Did any of his editors try to reign him in??  Did anyone say .... you know, do we HAVE to kill off this guy? We all really like him.  Or, can't we get a little more of THIS person's story?  Her character is interesting and the story is great ... does she HAVE to go through this bloody hell you've designed for her?It would be one thing if he replaced the characters we LOVED with MORE characters we love ... but no. Most are simpering, directionless, two dimensional nuisances, that take the place of fully fleshed out personalities like Eddard Stark, Rob Stark, Brianne the Maid of Tarth... not to mention Jon Snow...Oh, we get a lot of Jon Snow in book five.  But take one guess what happens to him!I want them back.  I want them all back, because the dregs we are left with offer nothing of appeal for me.It seems in Martin's world, all the good guys die. Everything bad you can expect to happen, will. Evil rules the land. We're left with a place no decent person would want to be. If I have the ability to leave a world that seems fraught with nothing but senseless killing, rape, murder, disease, I think I will choose to leave it.Which is why I won't be scrambling to read book six if there is one.  It's time to get out of this world...before I get myself killed, like everyone else does.",0.0
"it's really hard to take anything about it seriously.  I've read several other Barbara Erskine books starting with Lady of Hay, and have finally come to the conclusion that either that book was a complete fluke or I wasn't sufficiently observant when I read it years ago, because I thought it was a very original and satisfying book that expertly wove the past and present together into a compelling whole and I have not been able to say the same about any of her other books I've read, though until this one, I haven't felt as if my intelligence actually was being insulted.This book is extremely formulaic and full of stereotypes, not characters.  The ghostly incidents in the book are absolutely ludicrous and anyone who takes any serious interest in ghosts and possession will wonder how Barbara Erskine could possibly have done any research in either matter.  I realize there is such a thing as suspension of disbelief, but when there are SO many books and TV shows out there on haunted locations and how ephemeral the viewing of ghosts truly is, it's a bit much to expect readers to buy, even in a book of fiction, that there is a town where the ghosts basically appear on demand.But the worst thing about this book to me was how insulting it was to the concept of Wicca.

"Boy, this thing is a mess.  Philip K. Dick never had much discipline in his writing; he churned out text at warp speed so he could keep himself in food and lodging, so some of his books are kind of junky, but really, now.It's not going to be easy to summarize this plot, just because it's so all over the place, but let's see how we do.  In Frolix 8, the world has fallen into a sort of two-party tyranny, alternately under the control of the New Men - mutant geniuses - and the Unusuals - telepaths, precogs and the like.  No one lacking one talent or the other has any access to power whatsoever.All this suppression has, of course, given rise to a rebellion calling itself the Under Men.  One of the rebel leaders, Thors Provoni, has been traveling in space for some years looking for extraterrestrial help.Into this circumstance comes Nick Appleton, one of PKD's plebian main characters.  He begins his adventure as a law-abiding if unsatisfied citizen.  He shortly finds himself involved with the Under Men, caught with forbidden rebel literature and on the run with a teenage girl named Charley.Pretty soon you, the reader, have to keep in mind Nick Appleton's battle with the planet's telepathic ruler for Charley's attention; the disintegration of his marriage and his flight from Charley's alcoholic boyfriend; Provoni's philosophical dialogues with the mammoth alien enveloping his ship as he heads back to Earth; and a partridge in a pear tree, presumably.  PKD could barely juggle that much material when his Ace Books editors only permitted him 180 pages.  Stretched over at least a third again that much space, it can't help but disintegrate.  And his conclusion makes it all too plain that the man simply didn't know what to do next - it's the worst kind of last-minute twitch.  He really should have set this one aside for a few months and let it settle, but he probably couldn't afford it.Indeed, the whole book seems tired.  It's got a lot of PKD's great themes, plot points and characters, but in a worn out state.Nick Appleton, for instance, is a solid PKD working class hero, like the television salesmen and electricians and grocers and such who people his earlier books.  Appleton, however, is a tire regroover.  He likes to think of this task as a form of art, but in truth it's a cheat and possibly deadly, as he himself comes to realize.PKD had also dealt before with world dictators, some cruel, some ill, some alien.  Willis Gram is maybe the worst of the bunch, a man who uses his enormous power for his own petty ends. This might even add some spice to the story, but Gram emerges as a flabby arrested adolescent who conducts pretty nearly all the planet's affairs from his bed.In his middle period, PKD loved to set several plot strands going at once and bounce around amongst them.  Most of the strands in Frolix 8 simply fizzle out - we never learn what happens to Appleton's wife and son, the gigantic alien leaves off philosophy the minute it lands on Earth and starts behaving like a mindless weapon, and all the threats disappear without another thought.PKD's gift for sympathetic characters seemed to almost desert him in this piece.  There's a lot of talk among these characters about saving the world from the purest of motives, but the actual desires on view seem uniformly petty - sexual gratification, alcohol dependence, the will to power. These people are unattractive even in a physical way, let alone in any other.He missed a couple of his most fertile themes this time round, too, especially the unsteady nature of reality and the effect of drugs on one's perception of that reality.  What little there is in Frolix 8 on those topics feels like an afterthought.  Could have been removed without any impact, and maybe should have been.And finally, he evidently couldn't even bring himself to remember his details from page to page.  Provoni has been traveling anywhere from ten to fifteen years, for instance - the number changes periodically.  There's anywhere from 10,000 to several million New Men and Unusuals on Earth - that changes, too.  And other examples abound.Now, this is PKD, and even his failures provide more food for thought than many another author's successes, but taken as a whole Our Friends from Frolix 8 is for PKD completists only.  If it wasn't for one thing I'd be tempted to dismiss it as an utter waste of time, but wait until you see what ultimately happens to the New Men and Unusuals.  Not only does it redeem the exhausted, washed-out feel of the rest of the book, it looks ahead to what PKD was about to become.PKD wrote Our Friends from Frolix 8 in 1970, at the tail end of a time when he could complete up to five or six novels per year.  No wonder he was burned out.  Clearly, he realized that something needed to change, and it sure did.  Tired and messy  as this book is, the compassion at its close leads directly to the conclusion of his next novel Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said, maybe the most touching evocation of human despair since the novel was invented.  Out of this transformation of his creative process, he produced A Scanner Darkly and the VALIS trilogy.  Now, that's the way to conclude a career.In 1970, PKD had only a few years to live, but he used them well.  If he needed to plow through Our Friends from Frolix 8 in order to do that, I say it was worth it.  Suppose we look on this novel as his way of clearing the decks and let it go at that.Benshlomo says, Every so often you have to throw the past overboard.",0.0

"Let me say I think GRRM has a great sense of character and can do a plot twist like nobody's business.That said, does he know how to wrap up ANY storyline without a death to the main character in that storyline?  We've invested hours and pages in characters and plotlines, only to have brand new characters introduced...AGAIN... and a character we are invested in killed off because GRRM doesn't know what else to do with them.I was hoping to find Dance With Dragons have more focus and development on Jon, Arya, Bran and their wolves, Tyrion, Cersie, Jamie, and Dany and Sam.  Was I disappointed?  In the end - yes, big time.  (possible spoiler ahead)I got a lot of back & forth with Dany and Meeren and almost no development of her relationship with the dragons or who else may ride them.I got bits of Arya's growth, but not much and only toward the end of the book.Bran - a few chapters of odd situations that seemed like filler and a way to put him aside.Jon got chapters about his dealings with Wildings and Stannis, but not the Others or Ghost.Cersie - chapters toward the end of the book ending in her being marginalized and set aside.Jamie - one chapter only!Sam - nothingTyrion - Hurray!

"I had high hopes for ""Flashman,"" hearing the series described as having the wit of Wodehouse, lots of rousing adventure and historical accuracy. But with an early scene of Flashman slapping around his girlfriend and then playing a cruel trick on a fellow officer, my enthusiasm waned. Things just got worse with more beatings of women, lots of racist ranting and some unconvincing swashbuckling. Fraser seems to find humor in thuggery and charm in crude brutality. Harry's just not an appealing character, and the ""historical detail"" is not worth having to put up with him. And as this was written in 1969, the lavish use of the n-word seems a particularly interesting choice. (As I am also a big fan of Chuck Palahniuk, Outkast and Adam Sandler, you can't dismiss me as some kind of PC prude.) The rousing adventure is usually of the ""farmer's daughter"" type and the settings doesn't come to life. Why would I read another book about a nasty frat boy when it just really isn't any fun? Try T.E. Lawrence (""Seven Pillars of Wisdom"") or Robert Byron (""Road to Oxiana"") if you want genuinely amusing Brit characters in exotic locales.",0.0
"Does anyone have a clue as to where this series is going?  Martin seems to be mired in a morass of his own making.  He's going nowhere and taking an eternity to get wherever nowhere is.  The cliff-hangers are getting stale, the characters are becoming less and less engaging, and I'm at the point where I don't even care how the series ends any more.  Martin needs to do everyone a favor and wrap the whole thing up once and for all.  But from the way this series is creeping on and on and on, I have a sinking feeling the ending is going to be less of a bang than a whimper.Judy Lind",0.0
"i'm halfway through, and it already deserves a five star review. the 6 year wait was worth it, i just hope he doesn't take another 18 years to finish the series!!EDIT:yeah.. ^^^^^^^^^ that was wrong.  i just finished the book today.  i'm not going to paraphrase the entire book or plot lines that i enjoyed/hated.  this book is, to put it simply, poorly written.the first 3 books left me dying to read more.  the fourth book was generally uninteresting, but i plowed through it twice and upon 2nd reading realized that the 2nd half of the book was actually worth re-reading.  this book, though i've only read it once, makes me wish i never picked up the series in the first place.the writing style has gone downhill, as if GRRMs voice has become a caricature of itself, and all editing has gone out the window.  i was terribly excited to see all the characters i missed in AFFC at first, and anticipated big meet-ups and possibly an explanation of ANY mystical elements thus far.  i was disappointed yet again.  to the people who are saying, ""well it's just the 2nd half of AFFC, it's a good 'transition piece.'"" does that mean that the 2nd half of a mediocre book should be just as (if not more) mediocre?  i guess in a strange way that does stand to reason, but GRRM [was] so good at bashing expectations!  now it seems like he's a one trick pony, using tiny cliffhangers at the end of chapters to keep us interested.  characters repeating themselves incessantly. even multiple characters having the same memories of things, verbatim..it would be one thing if the next book will come out next year, but as we've heard, GRRM isn't even starting the next book for another year. so it will be at LEAST 2-3 years before the next book comes out, and quite possibly a decade or more before the series is concluded.  i needed a little more out of this book to keep me interested.  sorry GRRM, but i don't know if i can",0.0

"MILD SPOILERS--I'm a little confused as to why this novel is classified as literary fiction, as it's lacking the strong character development and emotional complexity that most literary fiction strives for.  I'm aware I'm in the minority, but I can't honestly say I enjoyed this book.  It was very predictable, and the characters were wooden.  Marlena has zero depth--and Joseph isn't much better.  They fall in love, but it seems more like the affair happens because the author wrote it into the plot, not because these were two developed, real people whose minds and hearts shared something magical.  A few of the secondary characters have more detail, but they never go beyond superficial personality traits.The elephant is the absolute best part, and once I read that Gruen was inspired by old stories and photographs of real circus elephants and performers, I wished she'd gone ahead and written a non-fiction book so she could really delve into the struggle of the era and the horrible treatment of these animals.  She makes aspects of the circus interesting--in fact, that's why I kept reading even after I'd given up on the story having any real complexity or resonance, but the whole book is littered with anachronistic language that disturbs the realism she's aiming for.She's trying to get at some very deep issues (mental illness, extra-marital affairs, spousal abuse, the traumas of the Great Depression) but it's all very superficial.  She never quite digs deep enough to give these real complexity or power, so all of the characters have very obvious, stereotypical, predictably shallow reactions to these deep issues, and I was left feeling a bit like I was reading a kid's slightly juvenile interpretation of events.  Overall, disappointing and even a little simplistic.  The frame of Joseph in the old folks' home is the richest and most emotionally complicated part of the text--until the ending, which is utterly unrealistic and saccharine.",0.0
"So disappointed.  As what most readers will say, the first three books were phenomenal.  I could not put the books down.  Now though with the last 2, and especially this one, I forced myself to finish.  It really feels like GRRM has lost interest in this series and that he is only writing now for a paycheck.  This book was mostly filler, just like the previous one.  GRRM would spend pages on how someone felt, look or just the scenery.  I am also getting a sense that he has no idea what to do with his characters anymore.  They just keep dieing.When the next nook comes out (whenever that may be), I will definitely wait to see what the reviews are prior to spending the money to buy it.  The series is so not worth the money as it currently stands.",0.0
"Passenger to Frankfurt was published in 1970 when author Dame Agatha Christie was 80 years old. The novel is atypical for the Queen of Crime in that it deals with a rebellion by youth. There are no drawing room murders or much character development. Think of a mismash of ""Brave New World""; ""1984"" and dystopian views of society's future.Sir Stafford Nye is seated in the passenger lounge at the Frankfurt airport awaiting a flight to London. He is accosted by a young woman who begs to dress in his clothes so she will escape from persons seeking to murder her.She dresses in Nye's cloak and uses his passport. Nye drinks a drugged beer but is later revived. Back in London he meets the mysterious woman. She is Countess Renata Zerkowsi. Renata is part of a top secret team which is combasting the rise of a Neo-Nazi youth movement being led by a charismatic young leader named Young Siegfried.The Aryan looking young man is the son of Adolf Hitler who fled to Argentina where he married a blonde Englishwoman who gave birth to Franz Josef leader of the New World State. The boy has a Swastiza tattoo on his foot.The most interesting characters are not the pallid Nye but his Aunt Matilda. She voices many of the concerns about society held by author Christie. Also of interest is a fat old woman named Charlotte who is a doyen of the Neo-Nazi resurgence. As the novel ends Nye and Renata are planning their wedding.The novel contains long sections wherin Christie laments the state of modern society. The novel is often dull.This is one of the last Agatha Christie books I would recommend to a new reader of her countless works of fiction.",0.0
"For the most part this book follows the traditional Clancy model of an exciting beginning, a really long boring middle, and an exciting finish.  The difference with this one is that the beginning isn't that exciting and the middle is even longer than normal.  And again, this book would be so much better if it was shorter.There is a really interesting story buried inside, but there is so much extraneous material that it's hard to enjoy.  There are sub-plots that amount to nothing, extraneous details that aren't that interesting, and a pace that is excruciatingly slow.  Cutting out the unnecessary material would probably cut out about 250 pages, and that would have made this book enjoyable and better paced.  As it is, the book is a chore to finish and unsatisfying in the end.I was making an attempt to read through the Tom Clancy books I own, but this one was simply too much work.  At this point I'm no longer enjoying Clancy's writing, and I'm not sure I'll ever bother to read the rest of his books.",0.0
Are you kidding me? This book was a best seller? It could have been written by a middle school student. I read this book in two days flat. The characters were very shallow. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because parts of it were cute but overall it was a waste of my time.,0.0
"Like many readers, I was smitten with the world Martin created inA Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 1), was caught up in the vivid showing of the battles and the intrigue inA Clash of Kings (HBO Tie-in Edition): A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Two, and was impressed by his ruthlessness towards his characters inA Storm of Swords (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 3).  As with many readers and fans, I cut Martin some slack inA Feast for Crows (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 4)- the storyline was just too big, apparently for a single book. A rationale I thought reasonable, and although the storyline moved at a glacial pace, I had high hopes for some resolution of loose ends from Book 4, and some forward movement in _A Dance with Dragons_.  Were that it was so.  _A Dance with Dragons_ was in many ways, an utter disappointment.That is not to say I found Book 5 a total bust.  To avoid spoilers, I'll write in broad terms.  I did like the wider sense of geo-politics Martin develops here, as the conflict in Westeros has ramifications in the Free Cities and Valyria.  It was a relief to see the storylines that had diverged in _A Feast for Crows_  again rejoin each other, and readers are given a longer perspective of the political web that ""the game of thrones"" is: princes thought long dead instead found in hiding, old alliances and old rivalries between noble houses uncovered, details of storylines from the first four books (particularly around Daenyrs) brought to light.  In a perverse way, I also liked the lack of resolution of some of the story lines: tantalizing clues left about what will happen with Daenerys, Arya, the dragons; characters in difficult situations that I am anxious to see solved: Jon on the Wall, Bran Beyond the Wall, and Jamie and Brienne in the Riverlands.  As much as I enjoyed this, it was not enough to earn more than a mediocre review.There are many more points that I take issue with than there are redeeming features.  First is the geologic pace at which the story moves.  At just under 1000 pages, I had expected more forward movement of the plot.  This did not happen.  Stannis remains in the North.  Daenerys remains in Slaver's Bay.  Tyrion, for much of the story, is at sea - and so on ad nauseum with all the characters.  Books One and Two moved much more quickly, and which I liked much more..  Perhaps juggling 23 story lines has simply become untenable for Martin to maintain.  Another issue I had concerned the changes in authenticity of several of the characters.  While I recognize characters do (and should) change across the story line, Martin has several of his characters take almost 180 degree turns from who they were in the first four books - especially Jon (""The Night's Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms"") and Tyrion.  I also expected at least some sort of ""chekcing in "" with other characters from _A Feast for Crows_ would happen once the storylines from Book 4 was reunited in Book 5 - specifically the happenings and goings on of Sansa and Samwell Tarley.  It looks like readers will have to wait for the next installment to see what these characters have been up to.  In a similar vein,  Jamie was hardly mentioned at all.The divergence of story lines between Books 4 and 5 was a challenge as well.  As a relative new comer to the series, I had the advantage of being able to read the books more or less concurrently (I pity those who had to wait over four years between books), but even then I frequently found myself going back to _A Feast for Crows_ to reacquaint myself with characters and their stories that  I had fogotten all about, it having been 500 or 600 (or, in the case of Daenyrs) almost 900 pages since last they were a part of the story.  Some sort of prologue (other than the pointless prologue involving Wargs and apprentice maesters) recaping the story thus far would have been helpful, I think.As much as I am tempted to give _A Dance with Dragons_ a one-star rating, I can't.  This is a work in progress - I remain hopeful that, once the ""Song of Fire and Ice"" is completed, my objections and complaints will be inconsequential.  While I remain frustrated that the story has moved so little over the last two books, I also remain optimistic that there will be a payoff in the book(s) to come.  Those expectations aside, for a 1000 page investment in reading, there is precious little payoff for audiences here.",0.0

"It's inexcusable for this book to be as bad as it is, when the author is clearly a very able writer, and capable of coming up with some lovely twists. It showed promise; but some of the things MacLean asks the reader to accept just stretch credulity too far.  The plot has holes, the good guys are crammed full of contrived and tedious bravado, and, most infuriating of all to me, the hero continually endangers his soldiers and his mission through an utterly inexplicable refusal to kill nazis.  I really hope the movie is better (I've yet to see it).It's not without its charms.  You may be able to enjoy the way the hero cleverly improvises his way out of one predicament after another, if you can make yourself forget that many of the predicaments are directly caused by his own astonishingly stupid decisions.  You may find it possible to get your money's worth out of this book by just numbing yourself to the silliness, picturing Clint Eastwood, and accepting it as a quick-read thriller that will make - I promise - absolutely no demands on your intelligence.

"This book is completely uninspired. Huge swaths of pages are almost unreadable. This is fiction at its worst, pressing every button to garner the highest thrill quota. Patterson does do a little better with his following novels `Kiss the Girls,' and 'Jack and Jill,' and this is his first novel I presume from over ten years ago, but it pales in comparison to some other better works. Try Jim Thomson, Edward Bunker, or `Silence of the Lambs' (Which Patterson sadly rips off left and right here).This book leaves a disgusting film over the reader's cerebral cortex. Its only saving grace is an interesting twisting plot line that really packs a well thought out wallop.Read the two in the series that I recommended and stay away from the rest of Patterson's toxic waste land.",0.0
"At the end of ""A Feast for Crows"" (AFFC) we could read :""Tyrion , Jon , Danny ..... will be along next year (I devoutly hope) in A Dance with Dragons (ADWD), which will focus on the events along the Wall and across the sea, just as the present  book focused on King's Landing.G.Martin June 2005""Further, to justify that just 680 pages of AFFC took 5 years to be written, G.Martin tells us that ADWD was ALREADY finished. He merely had to publish the available material in two books instead of one.Well as we all know, ADWD didn't come the next year nor the year after. The book ""already written"" in 2005 took full 6 years to be published. It was necessary to remind these facts because, obviously this incredibly long time span raised significantly our expectations.If we had already to wait so long, it better be a masterpiece of A Storm of Swords caliber.Let us be honest, ADWD is to the Song of Ice and Fire what the Crossroads of Twilight were to the Wheel of Time. In other words a subpar lazy piece of writing which deserves 1 star because it is not possible to give less.As an aggravating circumstance comes that this piece of .... work was laboriously extruded during a full decade (AFFC+ADWD = 11 years).The Crossroads of Twilight has been very weak but at least R.Jordan didn't need 11 years to throw it at us.Readers and the series fans have speculated that George Martin has lost inspiration or interest.I submit that he lost both.First he obviously lost interest.ADWD has 959 pages prologue and epilogue included and contains 73 chapters.Let us be generous and consider that Martin mislead us and that actually only the half of this has been written in june 2005, so 480 pages and 37 chapters.That leaves us with 36 chapters and 480 pages to write.Obviously a writer committed  to his work and as devoted as G.Martin says he is, will put some hard work in the writing.Nobody expects 8 hours a day but ... what do you think about his interest when the result is 480 pages in 6 years, 312 weeks?If one considers that Martin wrote more than 1 chapter a week for the first 3 volumes (and how GOOD those volumes were !), he'd have indeed needed about 1 year to finish ADWD as he said.The unavoidable conclusion by comparing the 37 weeks of work with the 312 weeks delay is that Martin spent about 10% of his available productive time on writing ADWD.Those glaring disparities tell a clear story : while Martin had been both inspired and interested during the first 3 volumes, he bungled AFFC and completely lost interest in ADWD.As this would be irrelevant we'll not speculate about the reasons but everybody who occasionaly read Martin's blog knows why he lost interest.A severe case of hypercephalitis (new Tolkien indeed !) has certainly played a role .Second he lost inspiration.Here we will go in some length and spoilers are unavoidable. Actually there is nothing surprising or unexpected that happens in ADWD to warrant a spoiler alert but it is a tradition that I respect.As I said, ADWD is composed of 73 chapters. They are structured as folllows:The Wall+ Stannis: 22 chapters and 30 % of ADWD===============================================Jon : 14Davos : 4Asha : 3Melissandre : 1As you see this part which makes a whopping third of ADWD is all about Jon. What is so thrilling about him that Martin needs 14 chapters?Well Jon counts sausages. Cheese too. When he doesn't count sausages he receives wildlings south of the Wall. As they are many and more (mostly weak, wounded, crippled and otherwise impaired), he wonders what they will eat. And goes to count sausages. All this interspersed with""You know nothing"" , ""Corn,corn,corn""and ""The night is dark and full of terror"". It finishes with a REALLY ridiculous wannabe cliffhanger which will make you burst out laughing.The 4 Davos chapters are among the best and especially Lord Wyman Manderly, one of the few survivors of the excellent beginnings, is truly a character that still has 3 dimensions.Asha is useless drivel and Melissandre without interest.For those interested about Stannis like I am, his arc doesn't advance a single inch but you will be fed (another) ridiculous cliffhanger so that you may wait the next 5 or 10 years.Meeren + Daenerys : 33 chapters and 45% of ADWD===============================================Tyrion : 13Daenerys : 10Barristan : 4Quentyn : 4Victarion : 2I admit that I waited for this part with much interest. Most of us remember Martin's whining how he was struggling year after year with the ""Meerenese knot"". For the struggling part as I showed above he didn't struggle much. So what about the knot part?Tyrion ""Wherever whores go"" Lannister is actually on travels. You may leave him a message, he will call back in 5 years. Or 10. Is that all? Yes it is. Nothing knotted there.Daenerys transformed in a whining sex obsessed teenager with about as much intelligence as an oyster. We all know that her only purpose in the book is to tame her dragons, get to Westeros and kick Lanisters' a...s. Not that there are many Lannisters left because Martin has already exterminated everything that counted in the family anyway.Well in those 10 chapters Daenerys didn't make any progress towards this goal.She's stranded in Meeren surrounded by all kinds of Ahrrakz pffz Zgriks who do not like her and want the fighter pits opened. She doesn't. Then she opens them anyway. Everything is linear, boring and predictable. The slave and slavers can exterminate each other for all we care but they don't even do that. Not a trace of a knot here either.As Daenerys is temporarily absent, to get our dose  of Ahrrakz pffz Zgriks we need Ser Barristan to give it. He kills some guy in a definitely non knotted way.Quentyn. This is a disaster waiting to happen. Nobody remembers this guy  and nobody cares. But that's all right because Martin kills him after the 4 chapters anyway. Pure waste of time and space. Useless to add that there is no knot even with the wildest imagination.Victarion is a real badass, one of the few that are left. I admit that I enjoyed his 2 chapters even if Martin succeeded in the very hard task consisting in avoiding any action or character development at any price . In any case Victarion is a very straightforward guy with nothing knotted about him.So definitely this part which makes about half of the book is happening in places we don't care about, indulges in endless travelling (Tyrion) and descriptions, contains no plot at all and is generally irrelevant to anything that was important for the series. It is especially this part which demonstrates how uninspired and boring Martin became - the Quentyn chapters are an embarrassment and an insult to the intelligence of all readers.If there was any ""knot"" than it was only in Martin's imagination because with the best will you won't find anything that would be more complex or more knotted than a highway through Nevada .Westeros : 10 Chapters and 15 % of ADWD========================================Theon : 7Cersei : 2Jaime : 1Theon belongs with Davos to the best. We are in the thick of the contest for the North. The Boltons and the Freys are still their old selfs. We get a glimpse on what's seething in this cauldron and there are even moments which show that Westeros could still be interesting if Martin was not lazy and uncaring.Cersei was downgraded from a strong, beautiful  and vicious woman in Storm to a wilful totally paranoid bundle of nerves in AFFC. Martin finishes her off in ADWD. She is broken and exits the scene. Oh, I almost forgot, the last Lannister who still had some strength and personality gets killed too.Jaime's chapter is just a manner of Martin to taunt us ""I served you a cliffhanger in AFFC and you thought to get the result in ADWD? Well I won't give it just to show you how little I care.  Perhaps in 6 years. RAFO ! Hehehe ! ""Trash (for lack of better word) : 8 chapters and 10% of ADWD=============================================================Bran : 3Arya : 2Griff : 2Areo : 1Bran's chapters consist of Bran watching roots grow. Literally. Unfortunately he's necessary to the plot because he will deal with The Others when the time comes. Probably in many and more years if Martin and we live so long. So we had to suffer through those bleak chapters just to avoid forgetting who he was.I can understand that some readers were so desperate that even watching roots grow was an improvement to many other chapters so that they semi-liked the Bran's part.Arya's chapters are totally and utterly irrelevant to everything and anything. She has been training for assassin for the last 11 years and still does so.Griff introduces us to another resurrection. Not that we didn't expect this one.Areo. Who ?So what can be salvaged from this literary train wreck called ADWD preceded by another train wreck in the making, AFFC ?Theon (7 chapters) , Davos (4 chapters) , Victarion (2 chapters) , Griff (1 chapter) , Daenerys (1 or 2 chapters) and Jon (1 or 2 chapters) . Maximum 17 chapters out of 73.1 star .I am very pessimistic for the continuation . Martin has clearly lost it and the story will now just follow the gravity forces with much and more copy and paste. The strong and powerful characters,  we cared for are dead and those who stay are either broken (Cersei,Daenerys,Jon) or irrelevant (Bran, Arya, Stannis). Oh perhaps Wyman Manderly will be the only shining moment left.The plot grew stale , drawn out and predictable .We'll see in 10 years if Martin can recover but I won't hold my breath and do not recommend you to do so either.",0.0
"The history and the frame of this novel was composed and written with clever genius.  The explanation of the British presence in Afghanistan was informative too, so I wanted to like this book.

"I try not to write reviews of books I don&#8217;t like. I have before, but not often. However, I found George R.R. Martin&#8217;s &#8220;A Dance With Dragons&#8221; so disappointing and so irritating that I had to write something down. I can understand that perhaps part of my disappointment came from the fact that the &#8220;good guys&#8221; in his novels can&#8217;t buy a break: death, misery, bad luck, and stupidity simply plague them. But I get the feeling that the author is using the &#8220;shock factor&#8221; of this to sell novels, at the expense of writing a good story. At every turn the good guys (or maybe you could call them the best of the bad guys) either screw it up for themselves; the bad guys screw it up for them; or fate just appears to have it in for them.But what really gets me about this book is the story itself. Such potential after the first three novels, but so many words are wasted here and in A Feast of Crows. Paragraph after paragraph and page after page, they don&#8217;t add to the story or to the characters. They&#8217;re just words and more words, seemingly for the sake of drawing out an eventual climax. There&#8217;s dialogue that doesn&#8217;t matter and events that don&#8217;t add anything to the story or move it along. And to be clear: In the last two novels there are very few events at all, and certainly nothing approaching a climax.I&#8217;m extremely disappointed in the apparent way the battle with Stannis and the Boltens &#8220;appears&#8221; to have played out. (I say &#8220;appears&#8221; because with this author you just don&#8217;t know) But the event that I&#8217;d guess everyone reading this novel waited for with baited breath? We read nothing of it. What happened with Stannis and Winterfell is covered by about 50 words &#8211; IN A LETTER TO JON SNOW FROM RAMSEY BOLTEN?!?!?! Are you kidding me? This is horrendous storytelling! Such a slap in the face to readers.I&#8217;m guessing this is all an attempt to drag out an ending. Maybe for the purpose of selling books, maybe for the television folks at HBO. But regardless of how the final two novels of this series play out, A Feast of Crows and A Dance With Dragons could&#8217;ve been combined into one fairly short novel. Nothing happens for heaven&#8217;s sake.I&#8217;m sorry. I like the world of Westeros. I can even deal with the good guys losing sometimes. That&#8217;s life. But Mr. Martin tries too hard. Ned loses his head. Rob and Catelyn get sliced. Sansa abused. Bran crippled and wondering homeless in the north. No one seems to know where Rickon even is. And Arya? Misery from the first and besides, I don&#8217;t get her storyline at all. Now Jon. He doesn&#8217;t even have the Stark name, but gets the shaft (literally) just the same.Okay. I&#8217;ve said enough. The story here, in my humble opinion, sucks to high heaven. I&#8217;m offended by the author&#8217;s callous unconcern for me, his reader. Or I&#8217;m mad at myself for even reading. If I hadn&#8217;t enjoyed the first three novels in the series, I would&#8217;ve quit A Feast of Crows half way through and never would&#8217;ve moved on to A Dance With Dragons. Dragons, which by the way, spend the entire novel out of mind and out of sight. Oh, and did I mention there&#8217;s another Targaryin in the picture (not Daenerys, who we&#8217;ve followed for five books, but at least one &#8211; if not two &#8211; more, whom we were lead to believe were dead!).It&#8217;s unlikely I read the final two books in this series. And I will be terminating my Sunday evening viewing of HBO&#8217;s Game of Thrones. I know where it&#8217;s going and I don&#8217;t like it. However, the lack of actual action and events in the books should make it easier for the TV series to cover everything. After all, nothing is really happening that we need to see to know where things are going!(SPOILER) Here&#8217;s how bad it is: Even the good Uncle Kevan Lannister appears to bite the dust, a victim to Mr. Martin&#8217;s need to put killing ahead of storytelling. One good thing about all of the good guys dying and probably the only reason I would even consider coming back for the last two books: soon the author will have to start killing bad guys! There&#8217;s hardly anyone else left!A Feast of Crows and A Dance With Dragons: Two of the worst books I&#8217;ve ever read, and many wasted hours of my life I&#8217;ll never get back.Goodbye Westeros.

"I tried to start this book three times and each time I could not finish it.  Finally I sat down and forced myself to read it.  GRRM has famously said this book was a b****h to write.  Well it was a b****h to read too.  There was some plot movement in the book but not nearly enough for a book this size.  Most of the characters I cared about are not the same as they were in the first 3 books and the changes are inexplicable to me.  The story is weighed down by endless subplots and a parade of new characters that are growing impossible for me to keep straight.  GRRM has shown himself to rely on strange gimmicks whether it was the endless and annoying use of ""nuncle"" in Feast to opening up his bag of tricks as a 80's TV hack and relying on multiple cliff hangers in Dance that would make the producers of Dallas or Dynasty blush with embarrassment.  From where I am sitting GRRM has lost all discipline and interest in this project, so whether he publishes again is a question in my mind.  I find myself no longer caring, which is a shame.

"I read G.R.R.Martin's Song of Ice and Fire Series several years ago and loved them. I re-read them recently to prepare not only for the publication of A Dance With Dragons but also before I watched the HBO series starting with A Game of Thrones.  I was excited at the prospect of a new chapter in Stark and Lannister lives but I was very disappointed.  It seemed as if he had written his first draft, chopped it down to 995 pages and given it to his publishers without editing or reviewing the content. Had I not read his first four novels in the series I wouldn't have read past Chapter Five.  Yes, he warned his fans some of the characters from the earlier books would not appear in this book but their stories would be taken up in Book 6. That wasn't the issue. It was the lackluster job he did presenting the characters that he did include and their sloppy story lines.Martin has an amazing ability to build credible, fascinating characters that you love or love to hate. Tyrion, for example, is flawed physically but possesses his father's intellect and political savvy without the inherent evil and lust for power (or a sibling!). Not so in this book. The insight, wisdom and basic goodness are just not apparent and I am not looking forward to seeing him joust on a pig's back when HBO gets to the fifth series.  Meanwhile, Brandon Stark wanders north guided by guardians we still know almost nothing about and seems content to become a tree. Jon Snow, newly elected  to command the Watchers on the Wall, is taken out by those who just elected him. Stannis Baratheon is determined to take Winterfell back to rescue the Arya substitute from Roose Bolton's son but nothing happens other than a seige of sorts defeated by the weather.  Ramsay Bolton gets far more ink than he merits and there is way too much detail of his sadistic treatment of "" Reek "".  We would have picked up that he was a "" bad person"" without chapters of gory details that do nothing to move the plot along.. I would much rather know why Theon turned on the family he grew up with and betrayed them.Explicit sex and violence were part of the first four books. They helped paint a picture of an earlier civilization where life was short and often brutal and you took your pleasures where you found them, while you could. A Dance with Dragons just wallows in brutality, sadism and any chance of having sex anywhere, anyhow with anyone. It wasn't offensive or shocking in the earlier book nor was it boring. Sadly not the same could be said about this book.The worst thing was that the story didn't get anywhere, nothing was resolved and new characters with their own, previously unheard story lines  were added to confuse the issue. So the dragons escaped, so the Sand Vipers were released, so Cersei got a little of what we had hoped was coming to her, while Jaime appears to be turning to ""good side of the force"" under Brienne's influence! After 900+ pages, it didn't really matter. The only part of the book that I really liked was Arya's story and her trials and growth in The House of the Dead.I think if Martin had taken another year to take the manuscript he had and plan more carefully how to divide it into books five and six, he could only have improved his fifth offering. I can't see why the haste when the first HBO series is so successful and so many of us aching for round two... we would have still rushed out to buy Book Five. I doubt I will buy Book Six. I will probably get it out of the library and buy my own copy if it is as good as the first four in the series.",0.0
"""Water for Elephants"" was the last Book Club selection I read, and It was not my choice. Reading it was a bit of a chore for me because upon reading a small synposis of it, I felt like I was back in high school. But like I did in school, I learned something.  I learned about what it is like to be in a circus, to know what drives someone to join a circus, especially in a different generation.  The main protagonist, Jacob Jankowksi, however, was a likable character and I liked his spunk.  Each chapter is narrated by the Old and young Jacob.  The old version would be looking back in time, thus, the next chapter would bring us to that exact moment in time when he joined, and when he met the woman he would fall in love with.  The writing at times, really didn't give me any feeling that I could not put this book down.  There is something about Ms. Gruen's writing that I just can't put into words other than: I didn't care for it, and I don't think she's a very good writer.I am a very open minded reader and am willing to try anything.  This is one book that I feel I wasted far too much time on.  I didn't even really finish it as I was still several chapters away from the end the night before our meeting.Take a look at my reviews to see some really wonderful books and see if you agree with me.Eileen F.",0.0
"I was really looking forward to this book. I was at a book store one day and for some reason Red Mars just popped out, perhaps I was already judging this book by its cover. When I brought it home I was pleasantly surprised to see it on the list I have of ""must read sci-fi"", so I couldn't wait to dig in.Red Mars is a book that details the colonization and terraformation of Mars and the politics that surround that. Some characters believe we should terraform Mars and others believe we should leave the red planet alone.Initially this book had me hooked, however I was curious as to why the author chose to include such a massive spoiler in the very first chapter and then go back decades in time. I recommend that if you decide to try this book out that you skip the very first chapter and read it later. The only purpose it serves is to spoil one of the biggest events in the book. I suppose the author included it for an initial hook, but it's not worth spoiling such an event just for a hook.The problem is that after the first couple hundred pages this book really becomes a chore to read. The landscape descriptions were interesting at first but over time you just want to read ""he drove by a crater"", not 3 pages detailing the event. The politics were interesting at first but over time I just didn't care anymore, perhaps it was because there were virtually no characters that I liked all that much.Here's an example of the tedium - there is one whole section of the book that is well over 120 pages and all it really boils down to is a character driving all around Mars, thousands of kilometers at a time only to arrive at these destinations with a couple questions ""Do you know the coyote?"" and ""Do you know the saboteurs?"". When the answer is ""No."" he drives another thousand kilometers to ask another character the same questions. Of course this section being at least 120+ pages means it is chalk full of bore.It becomes quite clear that the author is only interested in is displaying how much knowledge he has of Mars. The plot elements are just contrived and boring. The characters never really develop. If the author didn't mention their aging then you wouldn't even know these characters were in their 60s-70s towards the end (sorry but reading about people in their 60s-70s having sex is just - well, not a pretty scene).There are moments in the book that are exciting and I was hooked at the very beginning. After a few hundred pages I just started losing interest and by the end of the book I started struggling with each page - I was so ready to be done with it. This is the closest I've ever come to not finishing a book. A 5 star book makes me wish it never ends, a 1 star book is garbage through and through - for those reasons I give this book 2 stars because there were interesting moments but overall I had a hard time staying awake slogging through these pages.",0.0
"I would rate this higher if I could. There aren't, in my opinion enough superlatives to do this stirring Naval story justice. It's the story of the heroic H.M.S Ulysses and her crew who are ordered to undertake the escort of a convoy to Russia across the merciless and dangerous North Atlantic. For a crew that is at the end of it's tether after months of battle, it's almost beyond belief.It's a story of survival, for both the Ulysses and her crew against insurmountable odds. A story of men who have been pushed beyond their mental, emotional and physical limits, who don't at first realise that they will be called upon to give even more.It's a journey fraught with difficulty, battle against enemy air attack, roving U-Boats harrying the convoy at every opportunity. Then there is the harsh and unrelenting environment, cold inducing frostbite, angry seas, freak waves, unrelenting storms, exhaustion.The writing is descriptive, you can almost feel yourself aboard the rolling, ice encrusted decks of the Ulysses. There is a wonderful cross section of characters who are well fleshed out. It's a stirring, heroic story that will stay in a reader's mind.",1.0
"Another fantastic, mind-gripping read, holding its audience from page one. Bloodline spins the tale of a family-run pharmaceutical conglomerate.  Roffe and Sons has been passed down to the heirs of Samuel Roffe's family, Sam Roffe, the only male descendant and holder of the controlling interest of the company, Anna Roffe married to Walther Gassner, Ivo Palazzi, married to Simonetta Roffe, Charles Martel married to Helene Roffe and Sir Alec Nichols' mother had been a Roffe. Samuel Roffe, founder of the company, had decided from the beginning that his company never go public.  His theory, ""Never let a friendly fox into your hen house.  One day he's going to get hungry.""  When Sam Roffe (an experienced climber) dies in a mysterious mountain climbing accident, Elizabeth inherits his controlling interest in the company.  Suddenly, life-threatening events begin to happen to her as she holds onto her great-great grandfather's wishes after finding a book telling the story of Samuel Roffe's life and the tense, emotional and physical struggle he endured to build the company from the ground up.  In her great-great grandfather's memory and approach, she is determined to keep the company private and uncover the person responsible for the evil doings within the upper echelon (that being one of four of her cousins) or possibly her father's right-hand man, Rhys Williams.  Rhys, not being a member of the family, was brought into the company by Elizabeth's father, however, unless he married a Roffe, in this case, Elizabeth (since she was the only female left), would be unable to sit on the Board of Directors.  Williams was always kind to Liz (is it merely business or personal?) who grew up without a father's presence in her life (just the comforts of his money).  Liz felt, even though she harbored strong feelings for Rhys, she could not afford to trust him or anyone until she uncovered the person out to destroy all that Samuel Roffe had built.  Each cousin has their own issues; Anna Roffe's husband is out to destroy their children, Ivo Palazzi is leading a double life with two families, Charles is being lead around by Helene as a boy toy, Sir Alec has married Vivian, a wild, crazy party girl and Rhys has worked long and hard his adult life for Sam without the benefit of even a share of stock in the multimillion dollar business.  Each one has their own agenda for forcing first Sam and now Elizabeth to have the company go public and thereby attaining the financial means to destroy the ""fly in the ointment"" of their respective lives.  I could not put this book down until the last page was turned.  Sheldon is the ""master of storytelling.""",1.0
"As readers of science-fiction, we have been treated to many novels about our famous red neighbor over the years.  Whether it be the invading conqueror of H.G. Wells' or the blood and thunder pulp of Burroughs, or even the more scienfitic approaches of Bova or Bear, Mars always seems to fascinate the human mind, holding on and never letting go.With that said, Red Mars is the best novel written on the subject of colonization.  Robinson must have spent years researching this novel, and it shows in every page, as every detail is correct and meticulous.  His story of a hundred colonists selected to start our next frontier is riveting, and Robinson creates rounded characters with their own hopes, fears, and quirks.  They orbit each other, loving, distrusting, hating, always moving back and forth as the years roll on.  The planet changes them in ways they could never suspect.  That's one aspect of this novel.As always, Earth is never far behind, and Robinson also embroils us in the politics of our world, taking our pettiness and applying it to an entire planet, more interested in the bottom line than scientific research and human exploration.  And yet, through all of this, Robinson is speaking, telling us how colonization could be done, how it should be done, in his writing that's second to none.Everything in this book shuffles together to create a mosiac of the future.  Red Mars is about Mars, it's about colonists, it's about humanity, about people, about hope, about dreams.  I defy anyone to get past the engrossing beginning and not want to read the novel, or to avoid taking sides during the terraforming arguments.  This novel is a classic work and remains among, if not the, best novel Kim Stanley Robinson has ever written",1.0
"Therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee-exactly what was Donne conveying to us? The fortuitous nature of  existence, or the unbiased treatment of fate, or the luring equivocation of  individuality?  In the pitifully short three days, no, better be accurate,  two and a half days during a crucial advance for the republic forces in  Spain, Hemingway leads us toward the bullpen, behind which hid a chimera  that is to hunt us all our lives with the echo of Donne's famed line.Hemingway draws every little details together as a pounding fist-beating  recursive chimes into the readers' ears. And with the slower, more  passionate journey into Jordan's memory and future in a way, we become  enthralled as well to the question of choice. How will he choose? Jordan, a  formal Spanish professor in the University of Montana, chooses to foresake  the capitalist luxury of America and pursues the life as a republic  dynamiter in Spain.There is no question of individuality, only a  question of choice, a choice between masses and not identities.  All this  remains intact until Robert's own vision is no longer able to see between  simple black and white in the Spanish mountains where he prepares to blow  up a bridge during a republic offensive. His comrades are not all  communists, nor are his enemies all fascists; these men die not for an  ideal, but for an idea. And as he grows to love the rough Spaniards around  him: shrewd yet cowardly Pablo, thoughtful hunter Ansemlo, strong and  foreseeing Pilar, and most of all, a young woman ravaged many times by  fascist soldiers, Jordan starts to doubt the path he chooses. And between  life and death, ideal and reality, he waivers.Pablo is a sharp thread  that seams between characters and draws Jordan on with questions; he  appears cowardly despite his heroic records as a guerilla leader, and his  own dawdling conviction towards the idea of republic pricks Jordan's own  sense of duty. Especially with more and more emotional involvement  (dependency) on Maria's love, Jordan is wondering whether enough killing is  enough killing for a vague concept. Pablo's seemingly growing discontent,  as a part of a mass, is complemented by his woman Pilar's undying strength.  She reads palms and smells death, and it is through her strong faith in the  union of freedom seekers that the guerrilla group stays together. But  exactly ""for whom"" the bell tolls? For the Spaniards who shed blood among  themselves with visible strings from Moscow? Yes, warfare befalls all, no  one is missed by the silent blow although some can smell its scent and  others shun its path. A dangerous sadness identifies Pablo while an  optimistic cheerfulness characterizes Pilar, why are they essentially the  same ""lot"" then? Because Hemingway shows us, through the interaction of  specter of differences, a single vibration enlivens every frequency on the  scale. Robert Jordan is a mere node not knowing which direction to lean  towards, especially as he is starting to doubt the vibration.America  hasn't had her share of good wars, but what happens in one war is reflected  in the next, or isn't it? If one strong man's mentality comes tumbling down  because the buttress isn't strong enough, why shouldn't the next one fumble  as well? It tolls for thee, and there are a million ""thee"" out there  blindly believing they are the only ""thee"". They hear the same ringing,  although each believes he is able to distinguish a unique frequency; and  they die, their deaths as mere statistics. Thus it is actually an oxymoron  Hemingway presents through Robert Jordan's developing anxieties; he feels  ""tricked"" into believing the impact he himself can make in the war, as a  part of a hovering mass, instead, he recovers pieces of individuality when  he is physically and emotionally removed from the same mass. So at the  beginning, he lays on one stretch of pine forest floor and hears this bell  chime calling him to begin, he joins the guerilla band; at the end, he is  wounded and is left behind to lay on the same stretch of pine forest floor,  and he hears this bell chime calling him to end. The integration and  disintegration mark his journey from blindness to sight.Two and a half  days, who ever lives out their entire existence in such a short period?  Jordan does, and he sees so far into the pattern of living that he does  regret the ultimate choice he makes, not as a soldier, or a leftist, but as  a man redeemed through the moral bath of contemplation.",1.0
I found the book so interessting right from the beginning to the end. It starts outwith a death and it keeps you wondering how it all is going to end. To have an insidechance to see how circus people lived and how they cared for the animals gives you thatchance to 'run away with the circus',1.0
"For me, this book was like making a dear friend, and then bidding him farewell. I tried to savor this story, but couldn't put it down either. I was so sad when I got to the last page and it was over.I think the other reviews cover the storyline well...and I'm not a fan of giving away endings, but in general, it has vivid character development, authentic to the period and circus era of the depression years... and despite some graphic scenes (which add to rather than take away), it was a great, great read.I suspect it will be hailed as one of summer 2008's top beach reads...and will be on my recommend list to anyone who will listen for a long time to come.",1.0
"For me, Without Remorse is Clancy's breakthrough. He takes his characters emotionally to the next level. Predictably the action and wartime policy intrigue feature prominently, as John Kelly (aka Clark) is dispatched to Vietnam to free a POW. But the other half of the novel is about his vendetta against a crime syndicate in Baltimore. What did they do to face the wrath of this one-man wrecking crew? They killed a girl who nurtured him in a time of need. Kelly's revenge is brutal amd just. There's an interrogation scene halfway through the book involving a decompression chamber that pushes the emotional boundaries of the novel and moved me to tears. The ending chase sequence explains how Kelly reemerges as Clark later in the Ryanverse timeline.",1.0

Literally seconds after I finished reading the sample, I hit ""buy now."" One of the most brilliant techniques in the book, and my personal favorite, is the little jolt the author created every time the point of view switches from young Jacob to old Jacob, and it makes you flinch as though you too have been wrenched from the prime of your life into the body of a decrepit codger in a nursing home.The ending is perfect and satisfyingThe scenes depicting cruelty to animals were emotionally difficult to read, though. If that kind of thing bothers you, you may not enjoy the story.",1.0

"Robert Jordan is one of the most exciting, interesting and principled fictional characters I've ever had the pleasure to read about.  Set during the fascist take over in 1930s Spain, For Whom the Bell Tolls is a novel that will easily stand the test of time (not much of a prediction since it was written in 1940) and is one of the finest books in the English language.  Jordan, an American, is the main character who comes to Europe to fight the good fight against Franco's military thugs.  The reader is given a fascinating in-depth look into his psyche, where he reflects on his fellow soldiers, plans for warmaking and the justifications and rationalizations along the war trail.Pablo's another character who is burned into your consciousness long after you've finished reading.  A fellow rebel (they weren't rebels in the true sense, since they were fighting for a government they had duly elected; however, they have all the characteristics of guerrillas in that the Spanish military waged an immediate and violent war against that very democratically elected government), the reader is left wondering just how committed he is to the cause.  There is an incredible flashback story detailing Pablo's orchestration of the sadistic torture and humiliation of a group of wealthy fascist sympathizers.  The vivid description involved in this passage is nothing short of extraordinary.Of course the true democrats, fighting for the Republic against the well financed and better armed fascist military, eventually lose the war, but having that foreknowledge does nothing to detract from the cliff-hanger like feelings brought about by the various battles and journeys the rebel crew embarks on.This is the best, and most accessible of all of Hemingway's works.  If someone is interested in reading Hemingway, For Whom the Bell Tolls is the perfect starting point.  As for Hemingway's style of prose, what more can be said, except that it's brilliant, enthralling and readily accessible to the common reader, unlike Joyce and Faulkner.  In my opinion, every American should give some time to Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls.  Commitment, intelligence, sacrifice and fighting for the well being of your fellow man is all there along with a terrific love story. Given that the average American attention span is like a ferret on a double espresso (Dennis Miller), very few will give books like For Whom the Bell Tolls a try with the mass of pop TV garbage out there.An excellent companion to the book is the documentary film ""The Good Fight"" narrated by Studs Terkel.  It gives a mini history lesson of the Spanish Civil War and specifically focuses on a group of U.S. citizens (the Abraham Lincoln Brigade) who heroically went abroad and fought along side the democrats against Franco and his fascist military thugs.",1.0
"I'm going to write a very brief review of this book, so I'll just cover a few bases.  To begin with, I think the first three Song of Ice and Fire books are top-tier fantasy novels that easily contend with the likes of Lord of the Rings and the Wheel of Time.  The fourth book, however, A Feast for Crows, left ol' Martin's fanbase decidedly divided.  The book, to me, was basically a well-written intermission of sorts that served to move playing pieces into their places.  I did rather enjoy it, though.  Since that book covered the characters from a certain geography only, then A Dance with Dragons covers the characters who were not in Feast for Crows.  Now, since nothing momentous happened in A Feast for Crows, and nothing momentous was reported from the other characters offscreen, then it should have been a logical conclusion that A Dance with Dragons would be of a similar pace and low-impact plotting as A Feast for Crows.  This turns out to be the case.  A Dance with Dragons is really well done, but it's just very slow and not much happens to advance the overall plot.  There are some really intriguing events being set up, however, and since the book is so well done I found myself really enjoying it, albeit it not nearly as much as the first three books.  I can see why some people are disappointed, though.  Nothing happens in this book that you would want and expect to happen, and since A Feast for Crows was basically a plot doldrum, everyone seemed to hope that A Dance with Dragons would be a fireball of epic grandeur.  Its my opinion that since the last two books were basically huge intermissions of plot organizing, it stands to reason that the final two books of the Ice and Fire series will be mind boggling in scope and action.  In any case, this book leaves me looking ever more forward to the next installment, and let's just hope the intermission phase is over with.",1.0
"""Men are men and women women, no matter which side of the Wall we were born on. Good men and bad, heroes and villains, men of honor, liars, cravens, brutes...we have plenty, as do you.""The scope of Martin's world increases. The breadth of his characters grows by magnitudes. And the epic expands ever outwards.This book concludes little and alludes to a lot. It's not as fulfilling in and of itself, but ""Dance"" propels Martin's worlds forward in large leaps.Tyrion is back, and he was sorely missed in ""Feast for Crows"". Jon Snow's character evolves to put on a display of strength touched on in previous books but solidified in this tome. Like his previous novels, each chapter comes from the perspective of a different character. While some we know, Martin has the audacity to introduce even more characters to his historic rainbow of interconnected plots.""Dance"" is as big and bold as the preceding novels. It's dark, heavy, and written with a lusciously lavish hand - like its four predecessors.

"Kim Stanley Robinson's RED MARS is a monumental work, the beginning of a three book trilogy spanning well over 1,500 pages. Robinson manages to elaborate on points from the most mundane issues of gossip, affairs, and body image; to...well the colonization of Mars. RED MARS is an important work, and I think well grounded, on the relationship between human beings and their place of dwelling. Mars is a living creature here, and mankind manages to twist it in every way from our ideas, objectification, and the inevitable destruction at the hand of these conflicting views.This book is a must for any fan of hard science-fiction. A passionate, researched, and thorough account of the theoretical colonization of Mars...with the occasional lull of thirty to forty pages of terrain under its scientific name, under scientific terms.",1.0
"Wow. I hope that's not all I can say about this book, but that's where I'll start. Wow.Every time I hesitate to think I'll find a book that is captivating, entertaining, and that will keep my interest and keep me thinking about its characters long after the book is over, I somehow seem to find myself happily surprised. Water for Elephants was one of those books. It was really that good.I heard good things about it, always saw it on the shelves at bookstores, but it wasn't until recently that I decided to give it a chance. Why? A book about a circus in the depression/prohibition era is probably as far away from my ""normal"" reading zone as I can get.  But I'm telling you - it doesn't matter! Not one bit.Entertaining and engrossing from the very first chapter, I was taken away on this journey with the characters. Nothing short of fascinating, in ways I wouldn't have thought possible.  Part love story, part coming of age, this is at its roots, a story about life and the unexpected paths it may take. I really came to love the character of Jacob, and sympathize with his situation and his love for animals. It's been over a week since I've finished the novel, and I still think about the characters every day.  I really got caught up in their world which is something, I must say, is sometimes way too rare in the books I read. Many are good stories, but with Water for Elephants, I really felt like I was traveling along with them in their adventures. A pleasant surprise.Overall, I have already recommended to more than a few friends, and would encouragingly recommend it here. It may just be one of those precious few books that when you finish it, you stop and, at a loss for words, say - wow.",1.0
This happens to be just as good as A Storm Of Swords and beats A Feast by a long mile. I'm a little upset at the negative reviews that I'm seeing and am wondering if its just that people are upset that Martin took so long to write it or that the pace needs to be faster or something along those lines. A lot of people fail to grasp that its still in the middle where things aren't lightening quick but picking up speed from the fourth book. I have to confess that I'm not completely done but am more than two thirds done and I've had to pull myself away from it so I don't finish it too fast. Anyway I highly recommend this wonderful book and can't wait till the next one comes out!,1.0

Someone from immigrant stock with the pluck and drive to get into Cornell vet school is not likely to founder in this situation, nor just dismissively to walk away from his final exams.

"Tom Clancy's longtime hero, former CIA analyst Jack Ryan, has managed to assume the Presidency, Gerald Ford-style, without ever having been elected on a presidential ticket.Unlike Ford, however, Ryan had never been elected to any public office at all. Asked by President Durling to serve as Vice President, after the previous Vice President is forced to resign in the wake of a sex scandal, Ryan reluctantly agrees to take on a largely ceremonial office. The catch for the non-politician Ryan, however, is that the Vice-Presidency is only a heartbeat away from the most burdensome job in the world, and one which Ryan shivers at the thought of undertaking.Then the incredible happens, when a grief-striken Japanese pilot who lost family in a brief Japanese-American shooting war, mans a jumbo jet during Ryan's swearing-in ceremony and crash lands into the Capitol, thereby all but obliterating government. The President, First Lady, the entire Supreme Court, nearly all the Cabinet and most Senators and members of Congress are killed in a few calamitous moments.This leaves Ryan, who survived by a sheer fluke, to assume an office which he frankly dreads approaching. A complete political outsider, Ryan has an excellent working knowledge of the government, but close to zero political instincts. A populist and technophile of the sort both idolized and unelected by America, Ryan must bumble through his grief and shock at the horror which has befallen his nation and attempt to lead it. His hostility toward any form of ideology that appears other than starkly pragmatic, however, is ultimately disappointing. In the guise of non-partisan vigor, Clancy has Ryan deliver a series of startlingly conservative speeches praising a flat tax and denouncing abortion rights.If Ryan's syrupy claims to integrity are occassionally enough to set one's teeth on edge, Clancy establishes a magnificent character in &quot;India&quot;, the Prime Minister of the world's largest democracy. Referring to her only by the name of the country she represents, Clancy cleverly harkens back to the medieval language of kings, who refer to one another by the name of their countries. India is a nearly Picassoan study in minimalism. Only a few lines here and there richly summon up the mental image of the face of Benazir Bhutto masking the mind of Indira Gandhi. India's supernaturally beautiful English conveys all at once the history of her nation, her class origins and educational background, her exquisite mendacity and diplomatic sophistication.One masterpiece is a conversation between India and Ryan in which he attempt to secure her promise of safe passage of American vessels through the Indian ocean. India effortlessly evades Ryan's direct request a number of ways, each time protesting offense and hurt feelings on behalf of her nation. While India is written as a villain in Clancy's novel, conspiring against America, her delicious sophistication elevates her far above the supposedly well-intentioned lummox that is America. India's protests on behalf of her &quot;sovereign nation&quot;, as Ryan attempts to shove her military around, will resonate deeply amongst Clancy's international audience, as he is surely aware.In the meantime, America's vulnerability is a huge source of inspiration to any number of enemies, both foreign and domestic. Ryan's forte, and Clancy's as well, is in the field of international relations, and an array of hostile nations (India, China, Iran and Iraq) plan intricate attacks on the American homeland and its new President.Clancy has a speechwriter inform Jack Ryan that his use of language, while correct and to the point, is far from poetic. Clearly, the same can be said of Tom Clancy. But what Clancy lacks in artful turns of phrase, he makes up for in scholarship. None of the attacks dreamed up by foreign powers against America are, in themselves, totally unbelieveable: it is only their sheer number and simulteneity that gives &quot;Executive Orders&quot; a far-fetched quality.Tom Clancy's immense learning about weapons systems, military manoeuvers, Pentagon and CIA operations, is put to superb use. Even an outbreak of the Ebola virus in Zaire, which is quickly capitalized upon by the new United Islamic Republic (composed of former enemies Iran and Iraq), is described with striking and quite remarkable clinical accuracy. The governmental institutions he describes are entirely real. Clancy's gift is for taking the world of politics as he expertly knows it to be, and rearranging a few pieces on the chessboard to suggest fictional events evolving from familiar institutions.A large amount of the pleasure derived from a Clancy novel comes from simply being able to follow it. The acronyms are endless, yet largely accurate and non-fictional. Clancy is the ultimate man's man, sharing his war stories in warmly confidential tones, allowing the reader the great vicarious pleasure of merely comprehending: testing each piece of data and finding most to be accurate and real.While many readers will note a kind of &quot;jump the shark&quot; quality to Ryan's extraordinary assumption of the Presidency---for where else had he to go in Clancy's imaginary career trajectory?---the book has an indisputably educational quality for students of geopolitics. World leaders use subjective impressions gleaned at diplomatic receptions to decide upon military gambits. Everyone in politics and in the military has an agenda, noble or not, and all leaders use a range of discursive strategies to communicate with the public, the international community, their cabinets, and with other leaders. None of these 'voices' is entirely sincere or truthful, and some are not a bit of either.Clancy will establish in his readers the important instinct toward looking for the ever-present subtext behind every public speech and pronoucement, and for this reason alone, at least one or two of his novels should be attempted by any serious student of politics.",1.0
"After watching the movie (which I liked), my sister gave me the book. I was really excited about reading it, I know it's a bestseller and that I was probably going to like it. I admit, the real reason that made me curious about this story was that Jacob, the protagonist, is a veterinarian, like me.Jacob is a young man who is about to end his studies, when life gives him an awful surprise. His parents are dead, and he is left with nothing. Running from his old life, he jumps into the train of a circus called The Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. He is saved from being hurled out of the train only because he's a veterinarian. The circus have a lot of animals, and they need to be taken care of.Jacob is young, innocent and a veterinarian with a big love for animals. Taking care of the animals makes him happy, and that is how he met Marlena. Beautiful, fragile, but married.I really liked this book. I loved how the author described life at the circus. It's obvious she investigated about circus, the people who worked at them, how they function, and their animals.But what I liked more was the writing. The story is told by old Jacob. He's 90 years old, or 93, and his memories about the circus, his wife and his life don't die. He starts narrating the story, but suddenly you realize you are reading young Jacob while being at the circus.Overall, Water for Elephants was a book that grabbed me from the beginning. Although I wanted more emotion between Marlena and Jacob, it's a romantic story, full of action, love for animals and a magnificent circus.",1.0
"If Tomorrow Comes was my first encounter with Sidney Sheldon and I would have to say it was good. I didn't know what to expect from the book, after only reading it on a recommendation but was glad that I took the advice.The book moves quickly and at fast pace. I found myself expecting the story to go one way and then surprised along the way.I also thoroughly enjoyed the various 'cons' and 'schemes' that were told in the story. Makes me wish I was as creative.I give it 4 stars.",1.0
"A Song of Ice and Fire is every bit as good as you've heard, and then some. ADoD drags on a big slow in the middle parts as much of the story feels already known after AFfC, but Martin includes enough new developments and plot twists to keep you engaged long enough to reach the real fun part - the last 1/4 or so of the book when all the storylines begin really progressing and the table is set for the final two books. The Winds of Winter can't come soon enough!",1.0
"To say that A Song of Ice and Fire is a beloved franchise is an understatement. Many individuals, excluding myself, felt that George R.R. Martin's last outing ""A Feast for Crows"" was in poor show.  It was so strange to see the forums light up with outrage over a book that was, by my observation, one of the best in the series.  Two of the most common complaints were that ""Feast"" didn't feature the most beloved characters in the series, i.e. Daenerys, Tyrion, Jon Snow, and that it didn't feature a truly memorable scene like the Red Wedding from ""A Storm of Swords"".  That all changes in ""A Dance with Dragons"".  Written as a companion piece with ""Feast"", ""Dance"" features all of the northern and western characters that were missing from the fourth novel.More likely than not, the most common complaint of ""A Dance with Dragons"" will be the tremendous length of the book.  ""Dance"" is the longest entry in the series, and just as the case with Feast, it has a certain unhurried feel to it. In all fairness to the complainers, ""Dance's"" narrative does overlap with ""Feast's"" narrative for about the first 600 or so pages.  It is the investable result of ""Feast's"" own incompleteness, and the way its manuscript was culled from that of ""Dance"" to begin with.As previously mentioned, the three most beloved characters (Danny, Jon, and Tyrion) make a return.  In fact, they carry the bulk of the plot this time around, which depending on whether you enjoy their characters could be a good or bad thing.  Both ""Feast"" and ""Dance"" follow the culmination of the third novel ""Storm"", and Martin takes great care and deliberation to follow the main characters as Westeros tries to rebuild their nation in the aftermath of the War of Five Kings.  There are times in the novel where things are slow going, and it makes you wonder whether Martin just threw in the towel and is trying to ride this thing out.  But the cumulative effect of the novel, once it is over, is formidable, proving that Martin hasn't lost any of his mastery of writing what is considered the greatest fantasy epic of all time.  It really takes reading the whole book to appreciate what Martin has created this time around.Up north at the Wall, Jon Snow, now serving as the 988th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, has his hands full.  The Other's, also known as the undead menace that is destroying everything north of the Wall, are driving the Wildling's towards the wall, leaving Jon to figure out what to do about it.  On top of that, the self-proclaimed King of Westeros, Stannis Baratheon, is becoming an arrogant nuisance who hopes to unite the entire north by raiding the land.Elsewhere, everyone is waiting for Dany Targaryen, who has claimed the city of Meereen as her own, to make her intentions clear.  All are somewhat bewildered by the fact that Dany has chosen to take up residence in Meereen, abandoning her claim to the thrown, at least for the time being.  Dany is determined to do right by the people of Meereen, whom she has liberated from slavery by banning that institution entirely.  It is a decision that has crippled the economy.  It also made a whole mess of people angry and upset at her decision.  These people have begun to assassinate her soldiers, leaving the city a very unsafe place for Dany and her followers.And finally there is Tyrion, fleeing Westeros after murdering his father with a crossbow, he finds himself in about the most humiliating and dire circumstances that he has come across thus far in the series.  Later in the book, we get to see a bit more of what transpired in the lives of Arya, Cersei, Jamie, and the others.  Meanwhile, underlying everything is the sense that there is fresh chaos about to erupt with the realm.  It is only a question of where and when, someone will strike the first blow.As expected, Martin's writing is nothing short of amazing.  Beyond the prose, the editing is something to be marveled. Thousand-page epic fantasy doorstoppers are plentiful, but you don't often find one that manages to balance multiple plot threads and vast ensemble casts so smoothly that readers never get bewildered, lost, or just plain bored out of their minds.Once you dive into the meat of this novel, you'll know without a doubt, that you are back in the Seven Kingdoms, where lives are cheap, words are wind, and winter is coming.",1.0
"I loved this book! I found it very easy to read and get lost in the story. I liked how it was told from present-day Jacob's view looking back on his life. This helped me understand what type of man he was. I felt like I was there will him throughout this story. The setting of the Great Depression made the struggles and triumphs mean so much more. I found all the main characters; Jacob, August, Marlena, Walter, and even the elephant, Rosie, to be extremely poignant, especially when you remember the story is told from an elderly Jacob. The transitions from ""memories"" to ""current day"" Jacob were very smooth and I didn't feel distracted or lost during these changes. If you love a romance novel with hero and heroine, then you must read this book!",1.0
"i am really tired of the Thrones.  it almost feels like someone co-wrote this last one.  i like to read while i eat and the descriptions of death and mayhem are much more disgusting than the first four.Also, he is adding new people and basically ignoring our old friends and enemies.  i'm half way through the last one (thank goodness it is the last one) and i'm just not interested anymore but i'll finish it because i've spent too much time on it.",1.0
"While I would not recommend this book to a young reader due to a couple pretty explicate scenes I would recommend it to any adult who just loves a good book.  Once I started reading it I could not put it down.  I hesitated reading it because I didn't think that the subject matter would be interesting, but I was so wrong.  This is a wonderfully written book.",1.0
"What a terrific read!  It personally took me a few chapters to get into the book, seemed slow in parts but the story line made up for it.  My sisters ranted and raved about this book when it first hit the scene in 2006 I believe and I just read it-- and it was worth the read.  The depth and substance of the book was what kept me interested and invested in the characters.*Taken from another reviewer because it's said so well and I believe the same thing of the book: ""Water for Elephants is a great book for a summer read.  It's obvious that the author did her research into the time period (post-Depression America), and the subject matter (traveling circuses).  According to the author's note at the end of the book, many of the compelling anecdotes in the story were based upon real events, culled from the diaries and personal histories of old-time circus performers.  As a result, Water for Elephants is a novel that boasts the rare combination of being both entertaining and informative.""",1.0
"I bought this book out of curiousity and the big hoopla over what a ""sleeper hit"" this story had become,I love animals,so I gave it a try.One of the other Amazon customer reviewers said that the main character was talking to a reporter. No, he's not talking to anyone, just us, but I was bothered HOW he was communicating to us.Since everyone else has synopsized the plot ad nauseum. I'll just report the weaknesses in this book.First of all, very little elephant!!! Not Water For Elephant(s), but Water for ELEPHANT, ONE elephant. And very little elephant. Whatever research she did on these animals was tiny, miniscule. I could have gotten more into the mind of pachyderms by watching a Nat.Geo or Animal Planet special.As for his being a veterninarian. I too own horses, been around them and vets for nearly 5 decades. What little circus animal veterinary work Ms. Gruen describes in the book she probably got watching a cable TV station animal special.I also concur with the veterinarian reviewer on the slaughter of the horses. If a horse is forced to watch the other beside it die violently, most likely when it smells all that blood, you can bet the ranch it would break its' halter or rope and be nine miles gone.I also found it very distracting the numerous referrals to minute body languages while the characters talked. Also, even though the story started pretty promising, once Jacob got established as an employee in the circus, it bottomed out into nothing but petty bickerings and jealousies among all the circus employees. Yawn....It was fast reading, but I started hoping the thing would end soon. And, yeah, the animal stampede at the end I wasn't buying. I think Ms. Gruen could have just watched Nat. Geo or Animal Planet replays of elephants gone bonkers on video in circuses and let Rosie the elephant just get even by squishing those who had abused her.",1.0
I read almost all James Patterson books.  This one was really good and had a surprise ending. Can't put it down,1.0
What is amazing to me is how close the TV series is to what is in the books.  How they manage some of it is beyond me.  Excellent read!!  Definitely worth reading the whole series.  I could hardly wait to get to each of the books in succession. Very well written. The extensive detail about all the various families and how their interactions ebb and flow or should I say clash and slash sometimes!!,1.0
"I read the five books in this series because family members were raving about it. Book Five is much better than Book Four, but overall the amount of killing, maiming, deceiving, etc. is too much and, frankly, it is becoming boring. The Enders series is much better, if you're looking for good fantasy. And, of course, the Harry Potter series is the best!",1.0
I waited months for this to come out in soft cover & it was so worth the wait!  It just keeps getting better!!,1.0

"I had planned on watching the movie first because it looked good and  I can't usually watch a movie and enjoy it if I read and enjoyed the book first and vis versa. However, the book got better reviews than the movie and I didn't want to taint my experience with the story, so I picked up the book first and I'm glad I did.We are deliver the story through Mr. Jacob Jankowsky's ninety, or ninety-three year old memory. He can't remember his age but he remembers his life with the train traveling circus in the 1930's like it was yesterday. We see the excitement of a life as a circus worker and more often then not the dangers that the job presents, especially if you start to fall for the crazy jealous circus trainer's wife.",1.0
"Growing up in the UK my reading material was an eclectic mixture of Enid Blyton children's adventure novels, Ian Fleming and John Gardner espionage tales and Alistair MacLean wartime escapades. It was in this environment that my love for well crafted tales of suspense, adventure and espionage was fostered and nowhere is this more apparent than in the MacLean thriller WHERE EAGLES DARE.Second among my favorite MacLean works (my all-time favorite being WHEN EIGHT BELLS TOLL) the storyline for WHERE EAGLES DARE was faithfully recreated for the 1960s movie with Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood (not surprising really since MacLean adapted his own novel for the screen).A group of British Commando's along with an American Ranger parachute behind the German lines in World War 2. Their stated mission: the rescue of an American General who has been captured by the Nazi's and taken to a mountaintop fortress.Of course like many I had seen the movie several times before finally settling down to read the book, but settle down I did and what a ride MacLean treated us to. The action is well described with white-knuckle realism and MacLean's complex and intricate plotting is both well structured and compelling. For those unfamiliar with either the book or the novel there is also a nice twist that to this day has me marveling at its pure ingenuity.Okay so the dialogue may not be the best, but I for one do not read MacLean novels for their dialogue.For adventure novels, MacLean is the master as much as Agatha Christie is the Queen of the whodunnit. I wish that the entire series of novels would be reprinted for a new generation to enjoy.",1.0
It's a very imaginative story that you don't want to end. My only complaint would be that the bad language is a bit much.,1.0
"I didn't expect to enjoy this book. I definitely liked it more than I liked the movie. It's clearly fictionalized, and sometimes the characterizations don't quite match up with the actions the characters take, but it was much better written than I expected. I've grown a bit tired of stories about Anne, because most Tudor books seem to be about her, and reading her story from her sister's perspective was a nice alternative.",1.0
Read this 30 years ago (at least) when it first came out and loved it!  Subsequently read every one as they became available and am delighted to see that this first one is being re-issued as an Audiobook.  Can't wait to  listen to it all over again!  Am sure I will agree with the previous  reviewers about the reading since accents add a wonderful dimension to any  book.  I am a rabid Flashman fan!,1.0

Well written. Gave additional insight to the living conditions in the early days of the circus. Looking forward to seeing the movie. The book should make a great screen play.,1.0
"I love the novel, Water for Elephants. It is the exciting tale of a young, veterinary student who ends up working for a third-rate, somewhat corrupt, traveling circus. He cares for the circus animals, while encountering danger, episodes of animal cruelty, violence and romance. It is a heart-pounding and endearing tale, told mostly in flashback.  The characters are larger-than-life, from the cruel circus owner, to the sideshow freaks, to the bawdy young ladies who perform for the grinning men - both onstage ... and off. I just loved this book from start to finish. And for those of you who have seen the film, the book has much more action, and less focus on the romantic angle. An action-packed, colorful story. I could not put it down.",1.0
Best book in the series. I can't wait for the next one. The show isn't enough to get my game of thrones fix,1.0
"Water for Elephants, by Sara Gruen, is a pleasurable book to read.  Among its many virtues, is Guren's recreation of the atmosphere of depression era America, and a unique circus subculture that existed in what now must be viewed as the lost past.  Leading this tale is a genuinely likeable guy, a rarity in contemporary literature.  This hugely popular book is without serious lessons to preach or meaning to convey.  Rather, it is a good story which provided me with many hours of pleasant diversion.",1.0
