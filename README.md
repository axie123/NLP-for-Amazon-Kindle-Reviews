# ECE324 PyTorch Machine Learning Projects

## Project 1: RaterMachine

This project involves a series of deep learning models that are used for predicting the 1-5 star rating of a Kindle book based on the sentinment from its reviews. 

This project had varying degrees of success. The CNN peaked at 81% accuracy on the testing set. The RNN achieved a testing accuracy of 86%. These models were initially trying to outperform the baseline model, which both did by a wide margin.

### Installation

Each of the projects are already in their compartment folders. To test out a project: download the folders exactly as they are in the repository and keep the files the way they are. It is recommended that you use PyCharm or some other IDE for this. Google Colab also works.

### Prerequisites

Here are the libraries that you need to run these projects:

Numpy - A data science and scientific computing library. Source: https://numpy.org/install/

Matplotlib - A graph visualization library. Source: https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html

Pandas - A data science and organization library. Source: https://pandas.pydata.org/getting_started.html

PyTorch - A machine learning library developed my Facebook AI . Source: https://pytorch.org/

Torchtext - An NLP library for PyTorch. Source: https://torchtext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

### Sources

To run split_data.py, must add file (3GB) from this link: http://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon/productGraph/categoryFiles/reviews_Books_5.json.gz

## Usage/Running 

It's simple. Just:

```bash
python program_name.py
```
on the PyCharm or OS terminal to run.

Can also be run in Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook.
