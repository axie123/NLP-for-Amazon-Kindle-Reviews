### Info

This project involves a series of deep learning models that are used for predicting the 1-5 star rating of a Kindle book based on the sentinment from its reviews. 

This project had varying degrees of success. The CNN peaked at 81% accuracy on the testing set. The RNN achieved a testing accuracy of 86%. These models were initially trying to outperform the baseline model, which both did by a wide margin.
